abubakar but obj has sailed his hand some nigerians knew ibb as a devil incarnate that love himself more than the country he want every property of the whole nation to be control by him very soon the whole nation will know the secret behind all the killing tag fulani helmsmen meanwhile fulani has been into the business of rearring for long time nothing of this killing it s was the politicians that introduced series of killing method to downgrade any govt that oppose their wish bcos there re few self selected cabal that believed they owned the country like obj ibb abdusalam abubakar danjuma and dongoyaro that newly incorcated into the devilish group just because president buhari policy against their own selfishness interest e g nigeria oil well has been share within themselves in which pmb refused to renew their license that negate the source of their business pmb believed the oil well was nigeria property and its should belong to the nation not individual i could remember operation feed the nation that belong to nigeria in in which obj diverted to obasanjo farm till today and all staff working for obj were on the payroll of federal government until just of recent that pmb struck out from the nation expenses just to mention few atrocities committed by the so called cabal that pmb don t support that cause all these calamity for the country let give pmb the time the whole secret of all killings will be exposed and permanent solution will emerge is the sustenance or preservation of their interest good for our democracy p p if our answer is no they should vacate their seats secured while they were in the party which they defected from and we preserve the right and freedom to take them out by any means if they fail or refuse to to so themselves p p reason national interest or the good of the people not the good of legislators and governors and the necessity to establishing our democracy on the good of the people patriotism and nationalism recommend that the error realised should be corrected and not sustained p p it does not matter that the action is taken now which party the action favours or does not favour what matters is that the action is taken because taking it is absolutely necessary and right being in order to establish and institutionalise service by people elected to serve the people who elected them not themselves the good of the people nigerians and not their good patriotism and nationalism and not selfishness uberrimae fidei and not caveat emptor in our democracy p p conclusion br the fact that they did not vacate their seats earlier becomes irrelevant because the answer to the questions asked is no and because to argue that they were not asked to vacate their seats earlier is a mischievous criminal and strategic sophistry intended to preserve what has been realised or as the author noted is becoming clear by the day as the true motivation and motive of their earlier defection and defection now p  p this is a case of leaving out the anus that fart while slapping the ear that has no business with the mess of abacha and co i have come to realize that the great and the most populous african man today nnamdi kanu has foresee the breaking up of this fraud call nigeria with the things happening now i can see it is not just a threat but a reality goodluck jonathan and his family will be the demise of this fraud call nigeria the moronic terrorist in aso rock will know that the gentleness of that man should not be mistaking as cowardliness hence the reason he hand over to him just to avert the doom that would have befell the fraud call nigeria and to avert the plan of us and uk of indicting him through icj since obj abdusalami abubakar gowon etc is above the law goodluck is the law himself no body born of human can touch him while leaving the actual rogues behind buhari  p the fault cannot be in other people but in us that is my comment to the northern minorities the south is not to blame for the impression many time attempts have been made to engage the northern minorities but before you know it they leave you in the lurch and you begin to wonder what happen to all we ve agreed to do together this is the best way i can put it without offending br as for the fulani s you cannot be an aggressor and at the same time a victim everything taken together the areas you are fighting do not belong to you quit these areas and see if the fighting will continue if the fulani need some land for their business then they should negotiate with the landowners and abide by their terms and conditions this is the way out of this crisis and killings br as for the small tribe they should be united but be prepared to defend themselves always that they are small does not mean they cannot be large if they are strategic about their existence p  p daura and those pulling his strings must be fished out and publicly roasted no matter how highly placed this writer subtly tried to raise doubts in the story of tuesdays events by talking about daura being the fall guy without mentioning the main allegations on the inglorious events senator ben bruce is fast acquiring notoreity for being the mouthpiece of miscreants his tweeter followers are much like trumps they are ready to believe anything once it is from their principal he it was that told us about dino melaye s alleged kidnap he it was that told us of saraki s purpoted house invasion and he it was that told us that apc senators were being allowed into national assembly while pdp were locked out on tuesday all these info turned out to untruths wether they were made up or mischievously put out remains to be understood yet nobody is calling him out is there perfidy in application of standards p  p non of us ordinary nigerians know if the apc will succeed or not p p therefore i will not say as you said apc cannot impeach saraki and ekweremmadu p p knowing that they require of the number of the votes of the legislators present in the senate during an impeachment process and who vote either way and knowing that the ac does not have that number now i would be surprised if they are able to meet it p p but knowing the determination of the apc to achieve this in order to have harmony and cooperation between the senate and the presidency a necessity for doing all that they must do and correcting all their errors in order to win election knowing their efforts to win more people and the fact that they are winning some knowing that the apc has two vacant seats that they are likely to have their men re occupy believing that the popularity of saraki not his fame is diminishing and knowing that personal interests drives the defection of legislators i believe that the apc will make it p  p yes i agree with u to an extent but fg has been appropriation multi trillions for the past years that dos not reflect on the masses the north is ven the worst hit by poverty hardship hunger insecurity unemployment and the lowest hdi ever while political appointees are getting paid pmb came on the platform of apc but it was a scam he deceived the nigerian masses he is not intereste in party politics even though he is the party leader he is not interested in the apc progressive ideologies campaign promises manifestos but only in his buharism ideology which is viewed as centrist that is why he seems not interested in true federalism federal character state police restrucuring etc but he and apc campaigned and promised all this things but now say there is no need all we need is the integrity of an individual and his buharism ideology what is the equal to for the masses in my write ups i think i place nigeria on the category of hard hearing they see alright but the problem i noticed is they are afflicted with is more about ability to comprehend i e understand what you have placed on the table for discussions the who to tell and he she is ready to act and do so early which brings me to where we are today about the economy of nigeria p p here is what i decided to do more in case it ll help and that is if the leaders in african can be allowed between million us dollars as pension after they had served as that will mean that they can serve faithfully being forthright and righteous as far as they can and leave office with clear conscience without being involved in corruption of any sorts i believe that if we are to blame them it should be in the area of allowing the executive over step the boundaries of the powers allotted to him as they watched him undermine the court orders on various occasions and had not impeached the president on many cases that has indicted him morgan who is talking of monthly allocation mis management we are saying there is no fairness from source everything let me catch my fish by myself and i will share it among my kindred not mohammed coming to share it for me who is the owner of the fishing pound n delta are the most embittered region because jonathan used their ladder after scaling the wall he push down the ladder they have not forgiven him and they will never forgive him they are just waiting for the opportunity to take their pound of flesh ipob like other oppressed are just waiting for a chance to strike it happened in april mends took the battle in okah is still languishing in jail for what jonathan alone enjoyed tha is why you have problem with southern ijaw local government election in bayelsa people are not happy with him ipob are taking the best option under jonathan a conference was held with several positive resolutions to calm the nerves of the oppressed let s see what this government will do with it maybe they will call for another conference like professor wole soyinka proposed that the federal government should dailogue with ipob and possibly to the northern minorities too who are too afraid to protest or agitate for any freedom just like the biroms angas in plateau and the kaje s katafs etc in kaduna south and several of them on benue taraba adamawa kogi kwara youbas that at a time wanted their own state this is a forced british amalgamation without assessing and recognizing people s rights just to punish the south for their outspokenness in pre independence days ipod n deltans tivs middle bel tans ask for a referendum chose who you want to peacefully co exist with  p am not comfortable with the way erisco is complaining on dailies if he has anything to say he should put a letter across to the authorities that are in line with his assertion i have various experience in nigeria with gorvement unguided archaic unprogressive and unproductive policies that are roaming in nigeria system but at the same time one will fall as a fool if sympertizing with this our elites cos b you know it this fx that they are claiming to be the problem will be sold in the black market and make quick profit if it s given to them and many of them are accomplice with politicians in laundering our money across the sea examples if you get in bank and sell for mallas then you ve made multiply by m so this is why the country the country is been held in jugular vein by some little dotards meanwhile the apex bank on his docility trusted the foreigners while so as they say and it is true give a book with gift in it to a nigeria to br read and possibly get at the gift he ll not read it that far behold it not unlikely

notion that there could not have had a better deal than what was offered by the two even imf said subsidy should be removed there is no easy part to development you must pay a price in the uk the government has been on austerity measures since or so and they are still making more cuts in trying to balance the book and cut down the deficit in usa same but nigerians always want miracles and quick fix it does not work like that the people who want to embark on strike what have they achieved and what contribution have they made they are also to be blamed and they should stop blaming others its like a cannibal who eats up his parents then start crying that he is an orphan its just senseless in situation where things are working and the people properly informed you ll hope that the state governments i e assemblies can do something to reverse the trend but here too going by the gullibility obsequiousness of the people it is hard to expect that members in the states can see the harm and aftermath of the decisions of both houses in abuja p p perhaps the group protesting about president m buhari s return to nigeria could well be advised to channel their energies towards this despicable malaise especially now that in the nta s discussions this morning th august it is agreed that buhari has fulfilled the requirements of the constitution on his reasons to be absent from nigeria other than the cost of his treatment based on peoples tax if he richard maduku were if he is not a host were that matured and experienced he could at least have spared a thought thinking that whatever the imprudence he tried to highlight in his article about the igbo persons was not caused by them per se but were underpinned as a result of those this is not apc pdp thing even he himself was quoted to have asked yaradua to resign based on ill health and incompetence so why should his own be different why cant he practice what he preached now that he has the chance this could even save his life that s the advice i heard doctors gave to yaradua as well but the power hungry associates pushed him on the way they re pushing buhari now  p my brother the buhari s government is a disaster and the hailers know it and they are look for straw any straw to hold on to br the common straw they sell and resell to their gullible supporters is to persistently villify jonathan and his administration on worn out left over issues of election and use the instrument of government to rake up mucks true or false or real or imagined as long as it is attached the former president s name in whatever form these villifiers are so self opinionated that they speak as though they are god and that their words are gospel truth when they see you are not convinced then they rain abuses on you br it is in this light i rate this advice which though it included tinubu was all about jonathan that s our columnists for you they don t think much p christians propagate the gospel by planting churches everywhere i have seen crusade posters reading operation take over nigeria the bible said our lord will not come until the gospel is preached in the four corners of the earth it is chritians that will take the message there will it be good to accuse the big churches in nigeria that have branches all over the villages of attempt to christianise nigeria sir p p the pdp which you belong to sir started ethnic politics in nigeria and they wore ti a garment called zoning the north kept their part of the agreement supported obj against his peoople he won and did yearss when it comes to the turn of the north to produce the next president obj chose to decide who represents the north yar adua was selected gran pals like you went o sleep and never spoke out everybody know yar adua was sick he was not the candidate nigerian needs then but those that were suppose to speak out kept quiet yar adua came and died on the throne even where it is obvious that restructuring will enable engender the unlocking of the potential in the people across the country you still cannot see the need clearly they are in politics in nigeria so as to feather their wings that is what it s all about and they use the armed forces to afford them protection see i will be the last man standing that will support the past administration recklessness upon nigeria treasures which was the main reason i said earlier that nigerians voted out thieves and replaces them with fools and that is just the reality with my following explanations p p sometimes last year the minister of information and culture stylishly converted someone good attitudinal ideas that was forwarded to him and retwisted same into his own ill time change begins with me and he didn t stopped there he also went ahead to download barrack obama obsolete election victory speech on the net for the nigerian president and when bubble burst because nigerians are dangerous when it comes to fact finding him and the senior special adviser to the president turned it up that one unfounded deputy director plagiarized the information and he had since been fired and you saus these people are not fools p p cbn governor that is one among people destroying buhari government erroneously boasted sometimes last year that recession will be over in the last quarter of which never happened and to crowned it up the finance minister told us that recession is just a word and you are telling discern person like me that these people are not absentminded that is greater than a fool  p jonathan was removed from power wirth the aid of the cia because the fulanis and yorubas lied to the cia that he was not capable of protecting nigerians then they said buhari is the strong man of fulani emirate that once he comes to power all will be well is that the case with us are nigerian feeling the impact of the fake buhari rule buhari said recently that he will defeat militants in the niger delta the same way he defeated boko haram well the boko aram war is still on he swore to fish out the chibok girls one year on and we are still waiting now we know buhari got into power for the fun of it just to steal and better the lot of his thieving wife and followers from the south west p  p p now if the power as it is being proposed is taken off the arm that normally executes and is now passed down to the one that should judge in matters of differences between the other arms exec judiciary who will adjudicate if the judiciary that is now being lumbered with responsibility alien to their primary function got it wrong p p can you not see that the way dogara is going on about it is the wrong way p p leaving the politics of it aside this move is not in our overall interest  p when i heard rochas was contesting election i screamed and screamed on all social media i even raised the point at a town meeting i vehemently opposed him why simple rochas us a well known fraudster known to nig police and interpol but guess what an uncle of mine who was later given a post one of the special advisers called me and took hour of his air time to counsel me telling me how a future leader like my self must choose his words properly in public i was told owelle knows me and he is not happy i am campaigning against him i told my uncle point blank that rochas is a bad man and not the type of person we imolites should vote for well my uncle did not talk to ne for the next years today what do we have this silly aberration he calls free education has totally destroyed imsu there are students in imsu that have been in final yr for over years our dear owelle now operates like a sultan selling govt property to feed himself december rochas awarded his daughter a project to beautify the city of owerri for xmas project worth n m all this while ge was owing months salary of teachers he is now the boss of all even the dead owelle even has the effrontery to say ndi imo should not expect anything from him because he bought the re election with his own money anyways i am sorry for my people there is actually nothing we can do now as rochas is one of buhari s anointed incorruptible angels now we must watch our once cherished and envied education system crumble we must watch as our teachers turn to beggars we must watch and worship the sultan of imo but mark my words someone is coming in this country soon and very soon that will make sure rochas pays for his sins he will surely end up in jail  p it s not a matter that nigeria government does not know the huge benefits potentials of this and other things in this part of the country but the facts remains that they will never do it because in their myopic reasoning it will benefits us ss se had it been in the north it would have been built many years ago nigeria a nation that would bite her nose to spite her face pity very pity indeed lord have mercy judges like umar must be thoroughly investigated by the national br juddicial commission and sent packing if they fail to resign this set of judges shall br undermine our demkcarcy and set nigeria backwards protecting self interest and br acting as stooge for a reckless member of the political class who wants to come br to equity with dirty hands p p in lagos state we had the misfortunes of senseless br judgements on many political cases p p we had a case of a politician in opposition who br was found vicariously liable and br sentenced to jail without option of fine br a judgement that was overruled by the supreme count p p several electoral decisions were influenced by an imbecile who claims to br be the national leader of a political party all in a reckless bid to turn lagos into a one party br state where he remains the god father and imposes candidates who must never act br independent of him if they do not want to be used and dumped he knows he is on br a road that leads to self destruction but the rascal does not care p p we were here when a known global coup financier suspected african agent of the cia stooge of the americal imperial br establishment from abeokuta nigeria attempted to take over government from elected br alhadji shehu shagari at the kano convention of the npn in and failed a br failure that led him to finance the coup that br toppled the shagari government by his br friends in the military effect of that reckless move culminated in the stupidity br that led to annulment of the june th  p this is what one gets when he she is over zealous the efcc s magu is not competent and the said fight against corruption in nigeria have been proven severally to be one sided and an attack against opposition and those who speak against the president it have been severally cleared or stated that magu is not doing the job as enshrined in the constitution rather he is a willing tool in the hands of the president against perceived enemies and opposition and such qualities can not endear magu or buhari to the hearts of the sane and discerning i wish they have ears or can even read the too many looses they have faced legally in the past months and many more to come like i said it in my illustration thus the experience in nigeria is mirrored in the feeling from that monkey you let allowed to have a juicy drink from a common cup and in attempt to have the cup back it runs off onto the top of your roof or the tree still groping the cup to see if it can get more of the juicy drink from the cup he soon becomes anxious so incensed that he ll resort to having a peep into the cup wondering where has the drink gone he wants more of it because it is very palatable to its taste bud he has never had that kind of drink before  p an uncommon reasoning p p knowing that miyetti allah is associated with the killings in the north that it has been condemned by most nigerians because of the number of people it has killed and that any involvement by it in the campaign for second term for buhari in or in the issue between buhari and saraki will have adverse effect on buhari s campaign and election could it be that the man galolo who made that threat on behalf of his group was sponsored by a pdp man as a strategy intended to incite the public against buhari and win saraki his utmost interest bearing in mind that miyetti allah dissociated itself from the threat p p in order to establish whether this reasoning has possibility of being right or it is totally wrong let us examine the views that he was quoted to have expressed p p saraki ought not to be in office again as senate president  p an uncommon reasoning p p knowing that miyetti allah is associated

president  p i beg to differ from this writers opinion on restructuring it seems he is confusing the symptoms with the disease itself it s like a kidney failure patient being treated for malaria just because he has a high fever anyways the governors extravagance and the nepotism experienced in our polity is because the states are not well structured same goes for the monthly federal allocations it is the genesis of the economic problems in the country we have so many states that cannot and will not attempt to cater for it s self because they know oil money is coming at the end of the month it s also the same reason why nigeria is the only country in the lake chad basin that does not extract oil from that area and the reason why northern senators are trying to create a north east development commission essential milking other regions to keep up their ostentatious life style it was how the ghost workers evolved in nigeria s administrative psyche i don t know how many know about this advent p p it is clear that the political problems of nigeria started in the western region whatever however you want to carry your past political leaders i mean yes we saw how even obj tried to subvert chief awolowo as the rightful leader of the yorubas and afenifere group will not countenance that insubordination they considered it an effrontery for the yorubas certainly not for nigeria igbos nor hausas and tanko yakassai affirmed it we wish others still alive can be brave and forthright to submit under the foi bil now before they change it what they know happened to nigeria politically to bring us to the location position where we are presently including the of course the mistakes by the military who were the causes and contributory to the varied problems p p i said already much earlier about the part played by the french revolution leaders the th one at the time of montesguieu and john locke in england thus it is not only much about having good leaders who can comprehend policies on their own first before they call in advisers to muddle such good intentioned programmes policies but imbued to keep thinking about what is good for the people you could say that ndiigbo came to the limelight partially actively to the scene after his death only as far as the provision of the constitution stipulated and they followed it logically up to that resolution in the doctrine a situation we would never have been into if the constitution was crafted properly without that head start mendacity p p we passed through unfounded un necessary threats in by the north and up to all pointed to the obvious fact that something more disastrous could happen in nigeria if buhari did not win the election it was not a hidden threat and it came from the prominent leaders in the north including mallam adamu ceroma and dr br iyorchia and dr m junaidu  p there is no doubt fashola is the very best thing ever to happen to the art of governance and leadership in this nation br there has never been anyone like him that had so much demonstrated the virtue of pragmatic and detailed planning and implementation of government programmes br he was able to sanitise and bring back lagos to what it used to be in those good old days despite the persistent effort of some typical retrogressive nigerians to thwart and rubbish his sublime and rare achievement br as a governor he was a trail blazer br he was a role model that gave other governors the inspiration to work hard and perform br i can t fully express my joy when it was announce he is to manage those three vital ministeries br this is more so as it will provide him with the very important opportunity to silence all those his malicious and envious detractors out there for good br it s most certain fashola is destined to be the president of nigeria sometime in the near future p your first line of the reasons for the problems in nigeria nobody seems to have discovered accepted this is the quality and character of your political leadership post the civil war they were and are not trained to know how to manage the psychology of civilians otherwise from your calculation if you tell a child that he belongs to the family and he she has been inundated with the impression since the birth and such child has qualities of exemplary from the others as you rightly described an igbo person in your article tell me why he she must be blamed for having such conviction to move and act as nature has willed it in his head your submission therefore suggest that all this time even though you claim you re all nigerians somewhere behind your heads that acclamation should not be regarded as true  p god bless you my brother i can t believe what the pdp is doing or can it be said that our politicians are so draft that they can t do simple arthimetic what we the populace need is a viable pdp to serve as an option to this apc i doubt if the pdp can defeat buhari in the north marketing themselves to all the regions in the south would have been a strong starting point all these infighting and counter insulting won t get them anywhere i guess someone has to remind wike that its a federal election we are talking about not a clan or state election p  p sad that pmb is not really saying anything about this senseless fulani killer not herdsmen but they are not working or associated with buhari yes they hail from same tribe but it doesnt make them his personal killers so i think you should refrain your statement osanebi gej was in power when those niger delta militants were disturbing but we didnt blame it on him because we know they are not his boys or kidnappers or militants though i also agree with you that this issue would have nbeen raised by buhari at that meeting as it is of utmost priority too but who knows time may not really be on their side so maybe he had to table the most important now which is the bloody recession and america had to table theirs which is the oil  p dr bukola saraki is quoted in the punch to have given as a reason for defecting from apc to pdp p p the federal government appointed over persons into juicy offices juicy br offices my emphasis without allotting any slot to me or speaker house of br representatives yakubu dogara p p could we reason this reason together as ordinary nigerians by considering some questions concerning it p p which offices are juicy offices in the appointments that he referred to p p are the offices of senate president and speaker of the house not juicy br directly or indirectly p p did he by his quarrel over not having a juicy office let the cat out of br the bag concerning why he is in politics and why he left apc p p did he by this revelation confirm that the presidency is right to have br accused them of militating against the president s good intentions opposing br antagonising and vilifying him having intention of impeaching him and working br against his re election in because he is blocking their means of enriching br themselves at the expence and detriment of national interest with his fight br against financial corruption p p has he by this revelation which concerns him and mr dogara shown that the br interest of the people of kwara state is why he is in politics p p as a senate president should he have duty to only the people of kwara state br or to all nigerians p p should we not conclude that their personal interests and not our national br interests is the driving force of their defection p p should we give them sympathy or cooperation or we should become involved in br our own way collectively in order to achieve our interests p  p i see the allegations as what psychologists call projection p p by this is meant that the pdp is accusing buhari of intending to do what it would have done indeed what it did in many states while it constituted the federal government as many nigerians would remember p p the money he claimed has been given was characteristic of chief obasanjo s presidency while he was in the pdp as many of us remember his ghana must go bags p p by the way i do not know what party he is a member of now as he continues to work hard to bring in the next president as he has done since atiku forced him out of office p p saraki is also known for such use of money to achieve his interest a fact that includes how he became senate president ab initio and how he has many people under his dictate and control such that they do whatever he wants and go wherever he goes p p my position as a member of the ordinary non politician nigerians who have been the grasses in the fight that we have witnessed between the president and the legislators in the last three years a fight that would certainly be fiercer with saraki a member of the pdp as the senate president and ekweremmadu as his deputy is that we the grasses will suffer very much more p p this is absolutely certain because of the animosity that saraki and ekweremmadu have for the president and the igp because pdp is an opposition party and to do otherwise will be interpreted by the pdp as anti party activity and because pdp will do anything and all things to win the election consistent with its character and the ethics do or die given to it by obasanjo p p this is one of the reasons that make me argue here that saraki should vacate the seat of senate president or be got out by any means in the interest of ordinary nigerians national interest p p if our judges are nationalists they would put national interest above party interest and whatever the law says about the removal of a senate president who defected to an opposition party because national interest is above party interest and issues such as this issue should be resolved with this in mind p few days ago we were told he felicited with nnamdi kanu there after he comes up with not only such derogatory but really damaging account of the civil war forgetting entirely that the remote causes of the civil disturbances started from western nigeria and his father was part of it he defected and backed akintola as his deputy premier then and chief awolowo will not have it what you could term an incendiary report no doubt calculated to incite the youths in the north p p fani kayode always talks about first yoruba man that did this or that same as first yoruba woman he forgets that since the portuguese first arrived in abeokuta and had dealing with them in yoruba land there was no way an igbo man remotely located eastern region could come first notwithstanding the number of stowaways we were told prevailed in the western region during the period to europe i mean there was no way the eastern people could do that  p first please bear in mind that you demanded where br darlington got his figure from and that if you are right for making this demand my request for how and when us billion was saved should not create anger or impoliteness both evidenced by your first statement and your telling me to find out the answer myself p p second i wish to let you know that contrary to your claim because i asked the question does not mean that i have not been following our problem p p it could mean p p that we have different understanding or interpretation of this particular issue and hence the need to harmonise what we know or achieve agreement on it p p that what i know about what you asserted makes what you asserted wrong and hence necessitated by request for your defence of it in order to correct what i know if your defence is convincing p p that i am absolutely certain that you are wrong and br hence intended my request rhetorically that is to draw you out to reveal your assertion as one that is wrong and politically motivated p p that i wanted all participants in this discuss to learn br from you about the achievement as a credit to pdp p p other possible interpretations p p about the issue p p because you referred to the repayment of paris club loan by ngozi okonjo iweala i wish to let you know that i argued against the repayment through an article in which i argued that she did not exhibit good finance and economy management for nigeria because p p the bases for obtaining some of the loans that gave that amount were fraudulent being deceit inducement and stampede and hence that she probably did not investigate the bases at all or did not investigate them thoroughly p p that she should have investigated the different amounts obtained which amounted to what she paid thoroughly with the aim of repudiating the whole amount or some of it based on her finding because the inflation of figure known now as padding concerning budget was common p p i argued that she should not have neglected ignored or overlooked and because to investigate both before any payment was made based on conviction about authenticity or honesty provided by the investigation was absolutely necessary and a very good finance and economy management while to repay without investigating them was bad finance and br economy management and violated the demand of due process in loan repayment p p that she would have done better for nigeria by asking for and obtaining total debt forgiveness something that at least one finance minister achieved and that this would have established her nationalism patriotism and excellent finance and economy management and won her enduring honour and respect p p that she should have convinced the paris club a cartel that the government could not repay the loan because of lack of money and the need for money in some named sectors of our economy as a strategy achieving its cancellation as bad debt the answer is simple it was because he knew that his likes would never have become presidential candidates in the great party it s that simple he was never regarded as a saint but a smart criminal who somehow managed to escape the slammer by corrupting the judiciary apc never trusted him so he left to where his likes are and as you can see he is now a king over there p we are not shown what happened afterwards but it is likely that by that treachery the trespassers succeeded in raising their chick p p so if you can draw a paradox from this documentary for what happened in nigeria in that election they conspire for defectors and cross car peters without by elections and worn the election and they nudged dr jonathan and his group out of the system and we are now left in situation of confusion as the youths and other electorates now realize what happened to their votes it was not properly obtained from them they were mystified and cajoled unduly into giving out their mandates only for things to turn out the way we are witnessing it presently in the country contrary to their great expectations about change mantra p p we have seen asewaju bola tinubu he was in london just yesterday as the over all apc leaders to visit and discuss with the president buhari whatever was his concern about what is happening back in nigeria alhaji lai muhammed danjuma goje sen nkume and maza all muslims opposed need to study the recommendations of the confab and they talk of us being one nigeria asewaju himself was leader of pronaco and nadeco but failed to participate in the confab conference even though he and his group vehemently urged for such meeting for nigeria s re structure  p the pdp should give the public answer to this clarification that card reader is not included in the electoral act because it has consistently been claimed that the act contains the card reader and other measures intended to ensure that the election is not rigged in p p the party should also give the public the specific sections and contents of the act which it has consistently claimed the president is afraid of because they are intended to ensure that he the president does not rig the election in p p the party should respond to the reasons given for returning the act especially about corrections made earlier but not effected and explain why they were not effected p p if the reasons are true the party should tell the public why they still exist after a long time and consequent on the accusation of the president of inaction and its likelihood of making the holding of the election impossible p p hence the pdp should show us why we should take its criticisms seriously or trust that a pdp president of nigeria will be a better president p some nigerians in diaspora are the ones feeling this shame and pain but those living inside the country feel nothing many have not seen alternatives before majority of nigeria s middle class do not know that one can drive for one full year without police extracting cents from you corruption has been accepted by nigerians as oxygen necessary to survive they believe it goes on everywhere herein lies the problem but now we are being told that we are the most corrupt people in the world our women were once said to be the most adulterous in the world and this research was from condom makers our argument was to dismiss it as nonsense we could list countries whom we feel are worse but the fact remains that our obsession with things material are unparalleled today we know that nigerians woman are the most materialistic so it follows that such women are also capable of prostituting to achieve it so it is clear that the condom makers were correct we thought it was a joke but it is factually correct so i agree with this write up  p p uptill till the end of obasanjo tenure as he handed over power to yaradua the price of crude oil was today its between during the reign of buhari hence the apc lead government still can not afford to do anything and many nigerians can not spot this i personally campaigned for buhari not because i think he would perform but because he was the only alternative so one thing is clear if jonathan could be voted out of power despite the blessings of the pastors and the ancestors that means anybody can be voted out including buhari my submission is to repeat what i have earlier said nigeria politics is dirty than what people will sit back in europe and the usa to write about if we did not begin to be objective all of these crooks will continue to make fool of us buhari is not better than any of them they are all crooks hence lets wait and see how further events unfold  p i have not seen this bill and need to read it before i can comment about this report p p bearing in mind that chief philip asiodu while he was the minister for petroleum introduced the practice of taking abroad our crude oil its refining there and selling it at international market price when it is brought back based on his argument that it would earn us the needed foreign exchange for development p p bearing in mind that this is why fuel cost is criminal efforts to refine the crude oil here has continued to be frustrated the costs of goods and services have continued to very high generators continue to be imported and have become the only means of having electricity for nigerians p p bearing in mind the many fire cases due to the use of generators and the deaths and worth of lost properties due to the fires p p and noting that the development argued for by asiodu has not been achieved p p my interests are p p does the bill contain the prohibition of the policy introduced by chief asiodu p p does the bill say categorically that our crude oil must be refined here p p does the bill include punishment for the violation of and p p does the bill demand the full capacity working of all refineries in nigeria and is the time when this must be achieved recommended in the bill p p does the bill recommend ending gas flaring and channeling it to domestic use industrial goods production and social services provision and time when this must be completed p p does the bill prohibit the giving of oil well to any nigerian p p does the bill prohibit putting militants agitators for anything and people of similar groups in charge of the protection of pipe lines p p does the bill compel the minister for petroleum to declare his assets and liabilities before assuming that position and after he has ceased to be in that position p p does the bill regulate the activities of foreign investors in the oil and gas industries and how much they can repatriate to their countries p p does the bill contain anticipation of national interests that were not thought out at the time of writing it and those that will arise owing to other reasons and how these can be incorporated into it p  p from the vivid account given by this good and god fearing man tsav is there any more doubt about who killed dele giwa one of the most intrepid journalists nigeria had ever produced br after selling out one fucking omeben was lying to us through his teeth that soyinka hid behind the kitchen to escape the bomb blast br but evidence from the right sources has emerged that soyinka was right there with dele at the study when the bomb detonated but was only saved by the table in front of him br it was alleged that one colonel akilu called dele s residence three times within hrs asking for the direction to the house br tsav established a strong case and requested to search the offices and houses of some suspects but at that stage he met a brick wall br it is an open secret that though the law fully allows it yet it is practically impossible in this part of the world for the police to search houses in army barracks let alone the residence of senior army officers br surely all those that had a hand dele giwa and other s death shall never know peace and that includes their generation yet unborn p  br in i had an unpleasant experience at fmc owerri while my wife was sick first they needed a tissue for biopsy not enough was collected they wanted to charge me for the second collection and i insisted that i am not paying because it was their fault secondly on another visit the doctor prescribed a pain medication for her and when i asked him what it was and the functions he told me that it is a blood tonic but when i went to the pharmacy i asked the same question and the pharmacy said it s a pain medication so in my head i could not reconcile both so i went straight to the office of servicom and lodge a complaint while my wife is still with the doctor here is the part characteristic ironies of the man after the war he went to have communion with the igbos in the all saints church enugu and when they sang and the sermons were read and the preaching delivered the chief could not countenance the passages in the bible it was reported that he was overwhelmed and he sought for permission to be taken to the air port to get a flight back to lagos he could not hold back his emotional what is known is that nigeria has an impending crisis which appear to be discussed imprudently due to that cowardice disposition of the people but the time will come sooner or later when the crystals scales befogging your visions will start giving way to the the realities in the country restructureing for nigeria does not mean brake up of the country what it connotes is to allow nature to propel properly your differing capabilities and dexterity if you like so that you can develop the potentials as it happened and still happening in american states creation example you copied their system there should be no half measures about this fact as it is beyond obvious that progress of the people are stifled in some quarters due to the policies not properly thought out by the administrations in nigeria even before the arrival at the stage we are in the country now  p p no reasonable person will sign any legal document that has even one error or flaw p p the pdp must show to nigerians that the errors that were pointed out including those that were published in this report do not exist before it can convince nigerians that buhari is refusing to sign the bill or delaying to sign it without good reason p p the pdp should also explain to nigerians why as reported here some of the errors were pointed out earlier but were not corrected p p it should not be expected that buhari can be stampeded to sign he bill in spite of he errors established and notified the senate and the house about p p by the way the members of the apc and other parties at the senate and house should cause their views on this matter to be published  p p no

t blame you the old age of methuselah have nothing to do with wisdom of solomon age is not maturity in other words the man is not learned and the only way he think he can help nigeria is by practicing zoological practices it s what a man learn that he has to give a goat can never give birth to a lion it always born a goat so that explain it all you can t study zoological and rule humans the man should have being left alone with is fellow herdsmen in the field you can see very clearly he is a cattle worshiper and up till date he is still missing the field life and he s cows that there is reluctance from the part of nigeria i e from the northern group against such move proposal suggests that there is obviously something hidden in their minds about the suggestion p p here is what it is we are told that even at the point of handing over for the civilian rule in the agreement under gen abdusalamin that the said constitution was doctored under his authority then you wonder why was that the case therefore the document could well be said was foisted on nigeria in total contrast to what america did in their own philadelphia exercise in passing or circulating their resolve onto all the states to look into the package or document and then ratify it the fears and pessimism he is bedeviled by can have hold sway only on people of small minds like he has obviously displayed in this article but one thing certain and it occurs in all tribes and or human existence is that he who holds the child s cherished toy gift up in the air by hand will sooner be forced by nature to surrender it to the child when the pressure builds up on his arm p p so i don t know where he was in the first coming of buhari and idiagbon part of the economic measures was the sudden change policy for naira and it was discovered that the igbos had a large chunk of the locall currency in comparison to what the other groups mustered in spite of the deliberate economic policies of the obnoxious  p second term is not a birth right neither is it automatic in a democracy you are allowed to contest among yourself in the primary and the electorate will decide who among the contending forces to elect to be able to have a second term you must be able to balance your performance politics human relation and accountable to the voters both at the party level and the place you are governing your projects must be very relevant to the need of your people when you become a leader you now belong to everybody in your constituency you must not see yourself as been above the people there was a case of a rev that was thrown out of service and asked to get out of his official house within hours and whose luggages were thrown to the street for not given communion to the wife of ambode first as the first lady of the state his inability to make himself available to most of his political and even traditional elders like obas within his own acclaimed place of origin neglect and contempt for your predecessor projects and person the position is for service not for personal arrogance when he started the cleaner lagos initiative and the result wasn t anything to write home about then you should have retraced or reevaluate the system and probably go back to the one psp that was working perfectly well instead you insisted that that was the only option he was glad to put a lot of psp operators out of job please allow the music to play on lagosians will ultimately be the beneficiary of the whole arrangement p  p i think that our situation now can be described as p p to be at a crossroads to be between the devil and the deep blue sea p p and in such other expressions that mean contextually that we are in a very difficult and demanding situation demanding independent intellectual analysis moral decision nationalism patriotism and enduring social economic and political values p p we are challenged to kill selfishness friendship ethnicity religion or place of worship belonged to i relation to any of the contestants reject any form of inducement in order to speak in favour of any of them and vote for for any of them take action courageously to bring about a government for nigerians and not as has been the case a government for politicians and establish this as the grundnorm ethics and supreme value of our politics p p pay no attention to the view of your bishop general overseer imam pastor priest apostle etc expressed on the pulpit at an interview or published in any newspaper because they can err in their judgment have their own interests and are motivated say or write what they say or write by this or are bribed to do any of these as was revealed earlier and because the issue is about your good now and in the future which they cannot and will not guarantee p p it should be noted that chief obasanjo is not the principle of our democracy not a god not the embodiment of morality nationalism or patriotism has several times demonstrated that he cannot be trusted to be consistent he demands that his will prevails and his interests are satisfied in order to remain with anyone whom he helps become a president is wicked and is revengeful when he does not get what he wants from the person he helped p the aim or idea of the new solution is premised on the obvious fact that nigeria has grown and intermingled to a level where you now have a kind of miscegenation and demography placements that may have differing opinions in the idea of a total separation which can only be ascertained through a referendum for the people but groups in the new administration do not see the rationale in the policy for a referendum for nigeria even though britain only just had one for their brexit idea and campaign not forgetting that the scots had one last year and are still itching to try again following the outcome of the brexit campaign and result p p what it is i said earlier whoever that advised for the presidential system for nigeria got it all wrong america had time to think and consider the pros and cons for the system before acquiescing to it and they were able to do this because of their earlier political exposure to what democratic practice means acquired from the countries where they came to that part of the world they came from whereas yours was derived from vendetta and vindictive motives underpinned by the effect of the civil war p p whilst it is not my position to decide on what to or how to go about the obvious political problems in nigeria i have as in the past proffered once more what is considered the right solution to the problem you have discussed in this features and all you need is for the political scientists and psychologists to study it and you ll probably come to see the reasoning in it  p p how can the military overthrow a govt that was just three months into its term in order to prevent se presidency p p what was the proof that at the end of the years if it lasted the npn would give the presidency to dr ekwueme p p can he please cite just one instance in the history of nigeria where a vp became president p p what was the guarantee that all the enabling parameters would have held still for dr ekwueme to have won the national elections if he was the npn candidate p p this is one of the things i disagree with when people comment how can we not pick the several little stones from the raw rice this man is handing out the interview is the raw rice in this case p p are we that so stupid and dull that these politicians believe they can just float a story of lies and we would all gobble it up with no thinking p  p the problem is not the constitution but our mindsets somebody is aggrieved over a leaders action and the leader is not from his tribe he will be jeered at from fellow ordinary citizens for being pained because the leader is not his kinsman at times more than jeering they applaud the action and recommend that more of such should be meted out to your kind we see how the different tribes here mock each other in their time of woes but what we dont know is that the real classification that divides us is rich and poor p p buhari amaechi tinubu are friends these there people mentioned here have kinsmen that they hate passionately to them it is about interests we are here hating and loving based on tribe if you are exposed sure you have met people from other tribes who you genuinely liked and cared about tribal bigotry is sold by leaders when they need your vote in the end its your friends and neighbors that got your back regardless of tribe the leaders we brawl over dont give a hoot about you the same goes where they decide to buy houses they usually do not register the ownership in their actual names such that in the even of a probe as buhari is prone now in nigeria the tendency will be that they can forgo or decide to forfeit such expensive properties houses to save their faces because the monies used to procure them in the first place do not belong to them p p so what i am driving at in effect is if buhari can beg nigerians including their past leaders and the grounds that it is not only abacha that offended in the act to return the loots they have as he has tried to nigeria will then have less to do about the problems they will have no problem in facing industrialization of the country p has the igp received it p p in this regard it is noted that the the leader of the gang that robbed and killed at offa revealed that they are his tugs consequent on which he was asked to write the explanation as due respect to the vp who requested softer legal measure over the alleged crime and a sign of respect for the institution that he heads or the seat that he occupies p p suppose he has not written it and refuses to write it what will the senate national assembly do if the igp goes non to carry out the recommendations of the law regarding the allegation p  p my dear sister from what i have ad and heard the apc intends to remove saraki without brute force or police support p p this does not mean that the police should not be at the national assembly in order to forestall any breach of peace and ensure the safety of all people at the national assembly politicians and on politicians or that if there happens to be fighting with chairs and other instruments as we know the so called distinguished members of the senate who make laws against such conduct have done more than three times in the so called hallowed chambers following any successful impeachment of saraki the police will not do their constitutional duty p p on the matter of defection by tambuwal my view is that defection is absolutely wrong and any person who defects should vacate the seat that he occupied before he defected p p there should be a time when a practice is stopped or corrected because it is realised that its existence was an error ab initio or because its sustenance means the sustenance of its harmful destructive deadly or disadvantageous effect p p this should be accepted as the truth about defection and section g of our constitution p p it should be clear that legislators inserted that subsection in anticipation of their defecting and not for the good of nigerians or national interest p p this is why i do not rely on the tambuwal case to justify the decision to remove saraki p p by the way reactions by nigerians suggest that a referendum on the matter will favour the apc p you discover that the smae thing will persist after if it turns out that apc has not performed as expected there will be another defections and carpet crossing and the same problem will now move to another level using the same groups to effect the drift p p but think if you had continued with the british system after the civil wat it ll allow for that shadow cabinet not kitchen cabinet arrangement whereby members in the opposition will feel contended that sooner or later they ll be able to form government thus it allows both sensitization of the politicians and the electorates to watch what is going in in the houses state or federal and will compel parties to seek for good and properly qualified candidates as members in the hope that they ll earn the mandate of the electorates if they stick together to form a formidable opposition against what you have now regarded as anything goes by which i mean anybody can get on boar in your kind of presidential system in nigeria i e the present system encourages the carry on saga p p look like i said earlier already i am not the adviser to nigeria but merely supplying persuasive solutions those who drafted your constitution you know them thought you were as educated and enlightened as the american people therefore made nonsense of the the right system for nigeria hence i keep saying that you re in a quandary afflicting even including the phd holders  p i do not support violence where were the millitants in gej s years rule when the nigerdelta was no less developed but more plundered but we are at a cross road and it requires wisodm and pscyhology otherwise nigeria as a whole oil companoes andmthe region will suffer this is not about stubborness the nigerian millitary is incapable of securing the niger delta and the cost of thinking otherwise is very large buharis apc governments attitude is not helping matters for more thsn a year a cease fire was ordered for more than a year millitants have been making demands dialoguing through pandef but fg has not shown sincerity they are aloof infact they may have agenda the cost of stubnorness is too large it is unnecessary the governemnt and nigeria will lopse far too much thsn they will spend to reconcile issues buhari should show leadership in crisis management communication skills like yaradua did anyjow u want to look at it good or bad like or hate amnesty was thembest thing i do nktbeleove in all this leace mill settlements giving contracts but fg has had more than a year to find a long lastong road map development for the noher delta nut they are not seriousof not for vp osinbajo things would have beem far worse we are still cominh out of a recession hostilites will send us bacm into it conflict resolution is the only waylearn from the psst niger delta war with millitants if u like flood every where with millitary it will not stop them i do not agree with them but what can u do u aplly wisdom not arrogance cus the cost of arrogance is too high and i dont care atritude by fg like in the past is not desired nigeria will loose a lot if i will spend b to eneure i keep makimg b is i not better thsn i want to make but loose it all  p akupe was one of the most hated individuals that jonathan hired in the history of nigerian politics himself and ffk the apes in apc did all in their power to to rubbish them to no avail i mean there was nothing the apes in apc did not say about akupe ati ffk but jonathan stood his grounds from contract that he abandoned in north central to what have u to his character as an untrustworthy person but jonathan stood his grounds he worked with him today the same akupe who made jonathan loose a lot of grounds is now chasing sheriff all over the place for the fulanis if jonathan had listened to the smear media campaigns against akupe he would have become history a long time ago humans should always arm themselves with memory sticks so that they can play back some of their activities for members of the human society to listen to when the need for such arises in their lives i have never met sheriff in my life b but i think he is the right condidate for the party now not those who would be running to dasuki for every penny and on behalf of the buharmice p he will because we are in a tribal war between supporters of buhari and opponents br no matter what is said or done by buhari the supporters will not listen even if he has done monumental wrong they stand with him they see no evil hear no evil and are ready to take on the opponents it is madness just like your article labour to blame everyone but buhari br the opponents seem to me more clear headed in their opposition although it seem that the supporters believe they are routing for jonathan which this writer accuse easily of overseeing the largest national corruption where he got that from is uncertain and unknown but he stated it anyway br he however forgot he was talking about maina that was sacked by that administration maina who also claimed that they recovered trillions of naira and assets was during the administration even the administration assisted maina to remain alive by giving him a bullet proof car to do it job and president jonathan was personally involved in ensuring that yet the writer concluded that administration and jonathan supervised the largest national corruption br columnist must be diligent or they ll mislead the gullible br sobowale your article is misleading buhari is neck deep in all the scandals in his government now as it was in and it is an imprimatur of his person as it was at the ptf at nnpc now and before and as at the murdering of nigerians by myetti allah it is nepotism nepotism nepotism corruption corruption and corruption p  p judiciary under attack not corruption this administration is as corrupt as others or more this is the first president that cannot credbily show waec and when the issue came men that took the issue were roundly harassed and intimidated this is the most deceptive governments i have ever seen who made the people believe that he was so poor that he couldnot afford the presidential one and an old women was so taken in by this blatant lies by un unrepented liar that she gave up her whole life saving but after one year the wife of the so called dictator or saint is spotted going about with million naira worth custom made bag thats sheer corruption let her be investigated now instead you are diverted people attensions to judges that didnot any proven wrong these to my mind are judges are that openly known for integrity and for their independent mind as seen in their refusing to be cowed by the executive as the last hope of the common man in nigeria buhari is so bent on pursuing and implement the islamic agenda hence he need to stigmatize them as corrupt to get them out of the way well meaning people of the country and stakeholders should not keep quite tommorrow it may be your turn to be intimidated by the fulani hause oligarchy that has finally taken tight of the center arise oh compariots this is strange p  p i believe that chief mko abiola earned the honour given him by president br buhari because the votes that were announced before the announcement br was stopped pointed to his winning it and not because he won it p p to say that he won the election will contradict the fact that the br announcement of the votes earned was stopped that is the fact that the br election was not conclusive p p it should be expected that the record was destroyed or mutilated such that it cannot be known what all the votes are p p for these two reasons why does the senate want the result announced by br inec and all financial entitlements paid his family and that of alh babagana kingibe p p it should be recognised as an honour earned and the demand by the senate should be dropped p p another reason why mko earned the honour is his fight for reparation p p he promised to carry out the fight as president and ensure that it was done p p i believe that his death through poison is connected with this and many nigerians know the government that murdered him p  p no the president is playing crass impunity of a typical nw elite without pretence or care to whatever anybody thinks first rules law constitution or tradition is not important what he considers right is right whoever that does not like it can stuff it br his selection of idiagbon as deputy though it was in a military government was the first sign br handling of ptf was the second public sign br his i don t care pronouncements are enough to conclude what s happening now is not a fluke br but this in broad term the northerners behaviour besides balewa almost all northern political elite have been abrasive in power and just manage to tolerate the presence of others in government whether they are civil servants politicians emirs or others they are so suspicious and perennial conspiring or even sabotaging others outside their stock br this is not to say that some are not bridge builders but they are few and far between br this the genesis of the unending instability crazy decision making and agitations everywhere and it is not about to end it will et worse and lead us into a real civil war p  p buhari is good at nothing pls kindly withdraw that your submission when he took over in it was chaos all over the country except in the north buhari have no cerfiticate his only mission is to isslamizze nigeria or fulanise nigeria thanks to atiku s revelation when we were warning ppl in the last election they were shouting sai baba sai bubu it is good that they have seen that all that glitters are not gold ortom was singing his praises then and in return buhari has given him perpetual tears and fears tinubu has become a nobody in apcshithole no concrete project in the west south or east he told the un to focus in the north i hate to see this man on tv this buhari is evil the bible said when evil men are in authority the ppl mourn pls are nigerians not mourning today bcos of the satan incanate called buhari  p sobowale like paul twister in damascus have just seen the truth but he is still in denial he lied to us that buhari had a strong voice maybe he is talking about another person buhari is a sissy who jumps out to take other peoples glory as theirs idiagbon was the one with the strong voice in the moment he was absent buhari was removed easily no voice no whimper br during the campaign he never had a voice but being sherpard through it by desperados who haven seen that the north are solidly behind any northerner and the saudis haven bribed obama america and obama america haven coerced britain and eu into a regime change jumped in at the opportunity to be at the centre these are the ones who made the loudest noises locally promoted abuse and lies as a weapon of campaign this has defined the workings of this government to date br even at the ptf he chose a cousin to run the programmes without board approval where is the voice i think buhari is a very lazy man and a disaster in leadership br now the roost has set in and the regret is gradually manifesting but this is just the beginning we ve warned that this or even worse thing will happen with the choice of buhari br i hope osinbajo will help reduce the impact of the coming disaster p  p i believe that chief mko abiola earned the honour given him by president buhari because the votes that were announced before the announcement was stopped pointed to his winning it and not because he won it p p to say that he won the election will contradict the fact that the announcement of the votes earned was stopped that is the fact that the election was not conclusive p p it should be expected that the reco d was destroyed or mutilated such that it cannot be known what all the votes are p p for these two reasons why does the senate want the result announced by inec and all financial entitlements paid his family and that of alh babagana kingibe p p it should be recognised as an honour earned and the demand by the senate should be dropped p p another reason why mko earned the honour is his fight for reparation p p he promised to carry out the fight as president and ensure that it was done p p i believe that his death through poison is connected with this and many nigerians know the government that murdered him p  p pmb fears nothing if there was ever a time he was scared that must have been in not now not now that he made nigerians to come to terms with what change truly means not now that he fought corruption to the extent it now chokes politicians who are addicted to looting to the point where they defected not now that he has helped our economy inflation reducing not now where projects are completed and some ongoing in different parts of the country he has nothing to fear with or without the amendment of the bill nigerians know who their leader will be in already like the option a solution when it was first handed in in for the elections ibb and his advisers could not quite comprehend the imports and what name it could have earned him in the political history of nigeria if he stood by it but here we are it was used in and and nobody went to the tribunal to contest the results polled and in jonathan approved of it to be used and so you returned to it  p i have always said it that pmb is not the messiah he can t even unify the country that he is ruling after his election he said that he can t appoint people from the states that he didn t win elections also he was accused of appointing of his northerners in his cabinet than any other and he said that he can only appoint people he can trust lastly he told the world bank president to limit world bank development programmes to the north east only a statement the world bank president made public himself he has shown in all ramification that he is divisive and can t unify the country he has failed nigerian s and that is the simple truth those who are promoting him for are those who are benefiting from the administration directly or indirectly but by if the apc armed personnel carrier we will know that nigeria is a doomed and failed state  p i think that because buhari did not interfere with the process that brought the vital members of the senate and the house to their positions he should not interfere with what the legislators in benue state decided to do p p if a pdp governor in any state where pdp won the governorship election and has majority of legislators in the assembly had defected to apc and eight pdp legislators in the state assembly decided to impeach him something that they will certainly do would you have asked buhari to interfere or intervene p p the report says that the police prevented the legislators getting into the building and stopped the youths carrying out their intention with tear gas p p should the police not have done these p p if the police did not act would only eight members have taken the decision to impeach him would there not have been breach of peace is the death of at least one person not a possibility p p i understand that the law that gives him the right and freedom to defect also denies him the right and freedom to retain his seat as governor is this right p  p the igbo just have to improve politically change strategy and improve tactically br this counterproductive attitude of having only bad words for other ethnic nations wether hausa yoruba edo etc can only attract more and more enemies to the igbo br every human or group needs more friends in life br they also need to never loose sight of their positions as guests in other people s land whenever they are away from home br though we are all nigerians yet everyone knows where his father s compound starts and ends br for example coming to lagos to reside and ending up insulting the oba of lagos for whatever reason is sacrilegious br whoever did such in the olden days would be consumed by the oro cult br besides money is not everything but he who is power is the ultimate on earth br the igbo need to quit the practice of going along with any government in power br apparently such trend has turned out a huge miscalculation in the last election br apga could had been a veritable source of forming a very strong political base that would had served as a rallying point to get more recognition and get their pride of place in the mainstream nigeria s politics instead of pdp that failed to add any thing tangible to the lot of the south east br naturally every government will readily give priority to the interest of the people from the geographical area where they scored more votes br that fact can never change br p  p it is because of things like these that history is not taught in nigerian schools this scenario played out in almost every igbo town enters by nigerian troops during the war there are also reports of killings in lagos till date there are still various buildings that are illegally occupied in the name of abandoned properties br it is also for these same reasons that this nigeria as configured can never be progressive the land is full of blood the men in power are soaked in blood of your nation is being stifled history is distorted the rabbit is now acting as king while the fox and the wolf guard br the lion the lion they can never destroy i see a situation one day when the aggressor will make a hasty move and the oppressed will stand it no more that day that faithful day like the egyptians they will cast their gold on the oppressed and beg them to leave leave they will but not after the plagues have been completed  p i am apolitical i am not calling back for pdp but we must tell ourselves some honest bitter truths which is that inspite of the multi trillions appropriated by the executive the masses especially the north suffer worsened hardship hunger power insecurity poverty unemployment etc while he surrounds himself with misfits and imbeciles who tell him lies that his policies are great they met empty treasury nigerians are enjoying his govt his enemies are behind the killings food and power is now surplus the govt monies is going to paying pdp debts etc what is the equal to for the masses they cannot see or feel the impact of infact the country has worsened he made promsies came on a platform of chnage but it was a scam he has denied and thrown to the gutters the apc progressive idelogies manifesto and campaign promises and replaced it with his buharism ideology which is centrist and northern agenda is that what he and apc campaigned on and promised the masses a right thinking constitutional student or supervisor of the science will tell that in the situation we have in nigeria i e winner takes all with such a despotic clout engendering an autocratic approach to the socio economic and political problems in nigeria can never guarantee you what this man is talking about p p it is not surprising though i said earlier that nigeria needs to organize or have a system whereby the political leadership should be such that can comprehend prose and or policies handed to them first on their own volition before they call in advisers to muddle things up p p unfortunately in the case of nigeria since the military intervention in the politicking you discover that even where the right advise is offered the leadership still fails to accept for the obvious reason of egocentricity in some of them that tried their hands on the game that reason for their mistakes is largely underpinned by the training they have as military officers and that they came to politics without being transmuted first as they do in france  p obj certainly does not understand the meanings of the symbolic expressions the other room and the kitchen p p i wish that he understood them because if he did certainly he would not oppose their use by buhari or as the primary domains of women who are wives p p by the way don t women who are not wives take advantage of what wives do in these places to have husbands p p to explain the difference between having a wife whose place is the other room and the kitchen and having a wife who place is outside them i note that it is the difference between marrying a woman who is a secularist or a feminist and marrying women who is truly religious note the emphasis on truly or traditional not to be taken as timidity or stupidity p p the particularised explanation of the difference is the difference between patience jonathan and aisha buhari in relation to governance by jonathan and buhari p p this is what i mean would you say that patience helped jonathan more on the matter of governance than aisha has been doing for buhari p p we have to be sensitive to religious and native values concerning the duties or roles of man and woman and not continue in our gullibility thoughtlessness folo folo zombie imitation or slavish adoption of western error in order to be seen as modern or gender sensitive or not be called male chauvinists or any other derogatory name p p obj by making his obviously malicious recommendation established that prof wole soyinka was absolutely right to have recommended some years in a monastery for him br his studies in religion is certainly purely academic and inadequate p i am saying in your br deliberations try and look at my new solution for leadership and participation br for nigeria handed in since nd feb and see what can be p p arranged i mean not only arranged but to be enshrined in the constitution as br in switzerland s book since you re practically three countries going back to br the regional status before the amalgamation and up to the independence and br after the civil war everything went down hill about nigeria you changed the br constitution to give you both political and economic head start advantages br without thinking about the possible implications p p then came the stupid imf programme which lacked proper planning a country without br infrastructure and industries went to the extent of not only to devalue its br local currency but debased it to a level that even with the so called billionaire br nigerians cannot even establish meaningful industries with their ill gotten wealth br everybody turned to politics instead as most lucrative engagement in nigeria br mr charles soludo came to rescue the situation first he stopped the sale of br hand over contracts obtained from ministers and thereafter with his br re capitalisation policy but then it did not solve the problems nigerians br in those who could reach and liaise br with the financial managers used the funds to buy shares and houses overseas p p worse was that within the space of time you split nigeria into states the policy br which collapsed p p the tenuously hanging small industries and the burgeoning miscegenation within br the regions neighbours were pitched against each other and spouses got br disbanded because of the policy in statetism to be able to get employment br with all that nigeria was turned on its head and that has persisted to date br unabated for the obvious reason that all those responsible for the p p make shift policies were not trained to be able to comprehend what they were lead br into doing at the time they were beguiled even as we discuss and ponder over br the solutions p p just recall take a look at the time and the irony of the economic gamut br they said we were going to emerge like the chinese in that stupid motor cycle br mendacity referred to as okada okada indeed see what it is doing in nigeria br today folks the idea they hoped is that china developed through that approach br not known to the advisers and the leaders alike in nigeria that china had br economic plans and programmes hidden away from the west under cover made p p their people rely on bicycles as means of transport and when they were ready br they took everybody by surprise in total contrast to what happened in nigeria even br up to date we are still reeling on the devastating economic policies of the br s so many pastors murdered in the north under this administration yet no single would convicted under his amiable leadership nigerians are more polarised and divided than before more insecure than ever i do not blame buhari i blame the pastors who are doing paddy paddy with bujari and apc the blood of the murdered will be on all their heads if i were president i will not kill anyone to keep a one nigeria by force nigeria is not worth a single life instead if i should kill it will be to wipe out the politicians and political elites as jerry rawlings did in ghana nnadmi kanu tompolo etc are not the the problem they are a product of poor leadership the problem is poor leadership the problem is buhari yaradua would never have taken such demonic and stupid approach look at how yaradua managed the niger delta crisis that is how it is supposed to be cud yaradua is educated and understands that it is cheaper better and wiser to dialogue and compromise peace is priceless but everyone wants manu and ipob to shut up bit nobody is telling buhari to change his attitude of indifference biased bigotory partiality buhari made it very clear that the who voted for him will get far more than the who did not an see are seeing it in appointments projects etc ipob and nnamdi kanu is a reaction to nepotism do something about the nepotism but buhari is too obseesed by noerthern agenda vendetta and biaise that s why you people believe to induce voters in other to retain your position if what is doing is right in this country then you dont need to be bother you have forgotten that even your life is not permanent not to talk of your political position the same people you said you re representing out there are suffering poverty everywhere even the foods that suppose to be the only survival for the least common man is not available for us yet you re there driving exotic cars buying houses in overseas all your children are in abroad to achieve their protections and we are here battling with insecurities killing innocent people by your so called political boko haram and fulani herdsmen our president said that he has the names of the politicians who are sponsoring all these mayhems in this country butt did not tell the public and yet the killing still continuing apc agendas are to decimate north central states and displace millions of people to be disenfranchised of general election another agenda of pmb is the colonization of nigeria states for fulani jihady colonist for them to islamise the country that is why wanton killing of christians is being perpetrated enormously thank god for the good hearted imam who saved the life of christians from the fulani attackers more than christians would have been killed in jos recently even though the killing still continuing and we have igp who his first responsibility is to ensure safety of life and properties maybe if our igp was a christian then he would had a good mind to protect citizens and not to be used for jihadism and political interests because our igp is the worst igp nigeria ever have in the history  p saraki will never preside over the senate ever again he lost that the moment he confirmed his color and we always knew that he is not an apc man it is rather unfortunate that he has wrecked havoc in the apc he was allowed to do to the budget whatever he and his goons wanted to the detriment of the apc and now that the dust has cleared he and dogara must leave those seat otherwise what we are practicing would not be democracy  million barrel par day we will not be in all this mess we are today you will agree with me that the only business nigeria was doing as at that time was crude oil exportation and it serve as the major source of fund for the government when apc took over the price of the crude oil fell to dollar par barrel and there was no saving from the previous administration believe me no any government will find it easy to operate under this condition because there is no enough money on ground to execute there programs and that was what brought the idea of diversification of our economy to another sector like agriculture economy diversification is not what any government can achieve in two year it is a continuous program with time and patient we will get there the good thing is that they have started it apc has also done well in the operation of single treasury account tsa despite the fact that it was the last administration that introduced it as good as the program is they could not start it because they know with tsa no way to steal nigeria money again nigeria costume and federal inland revenue are generating huge amount of money that have never been recorded in the history of nigeria and you said apc is not doing anything what we need is to give them time you can not repair the damage coursed by pdp for good years under years it is rather easy to destroy than to build if nigerian can be patient our suffering today will end up as gain for us in feauture  p since obasanjo ceased to be president in he has spoken and written about atiku many times including in one of his books in the words that are very malicious and profoundly damaging to his character while atiku has tolerated him and even made efforts many times to reconcile with him and got other people to help him achieve this without success p p since the decades that have passed kukah did not see any reason to find out what the matter was and to reconcile both of them p p what was the matter p p as i have learnt from very reliable sources obasanjo was offended by the fact that in order to have a second term as president he begged atiku to give up his ambition to be president which atiku granted him although it has been described as the best opportunity the he had to be president and by the fact that he could not achieve his intention to have third term as president which he held atiku responsible for although while atiku opposed it courageously there could not have been any nigerian who did not oppose it p p does this not portray obasanjo as an ingrate power drunk and irresponsible p p bishop kukah who declared at a lecture recently that nigerian president are the most irresponsible owing to the power that they enjoyed which is comparatively greatest in the world according to him was in team that went to appease obasanjo in order that atiku may have that power as president in p p in the same lecture he derided our presidents for not studying at harvard university where he said although wrong all us presidents studied while atiku whom his visit was intended to help become the president in did not study at harvard university p p obasanjo declared as was published on august by the punch god will not forgive me if i support atiku to be president and bishop kukah did nothing about this blasphemous declaration and violation of the second most important law or about whatever was wrong between him and atiku that precipitated the making of the declaration p p this background helps us see that kukah acted politically and selfishly or beneath his dignity as a bishop shepherd and spiritual father and not in the true spirit of reconciliation p p earlier at another forum i expressed surprise and disappointment over the purpose of the visit and bishop kukah s involvement in it because as i noted obasanjo is not the principle of our democracy he is not a god that must be appeased in order that atiku would be president and he has many times including concerning what he has said and written about atiku violated the virtues of leadership and statesmanship and exhibited selfishness greed insatiability wickedness and revengefulness p p moreover some of his actions have militated against governance harmed our economy and undermined social order and peace p p i think that bishop kukah should be better thoughtful and more careful about what he writes says and his association with politicians as a bishop of the holy catholic church in order to save us lay catholics the criticisms by non catholics which are insulting and offensive p  p on the contrary the real bad fat are the imbeciles unqualified and incompetent fools called political appointees who have seen a moron as president that they can feed his ego and tell him lies that they met empty treasury nigeria is safe power is now excess food surplus his enemies are behind the killings the majority of nigerians are enjoying him the govt monies are going towards paying pdp debt etc when the truth is that upon all the appropriations of trillions the equal to for the masses is worsened hardship unemployment poverty power economy security etc when hdi is the lowest ever cus the masses only see or feel the impact of while the remaining is stolen by apc thieves i am apolitical i am not calling back for pdp i am pointing the clear failures of apc and aits president a man who is not interested in the apc progressive ideologies and manifesto but only his buharism ideology which is centrist and northern agenda that is why his appointments are cabals paddy paddy and kinship and friendship that is why he is not interested in restructuring devolution of powers state police federal character that is why under his amiable leadership nigeria is more divided than ever cus when a fish wants to rotten it starts first from the head yes the body was already bad but with a rotten head it can never improve or become good what is the equal to for the masses other than excuses blame game denials etc while political appointees are getting paid lining up their pockets apc can do far better than pdp with oshiomoles renewed vigor but the primary problem is that the president is like a horse u can take to the river but cant force to drink he is president by popularity he is not competent or qualified and he surrounded himself with incompetent fools and imbeciles he will destroy this country with another years of his rubbish govt p
