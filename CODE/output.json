        "author": "Onochie Anibeze",
        "text": "By Onochie Anibeze \u201cHey! Fashola has been here,\"\u009d screamed Chibeze. \"Yes, he has visited here,\"\u009d Ifeanyi, his elder brother concurred. Chibeze is 9 and Ifeanyi 11. Chisom who is just eight surprised me most. \"Fashola is going everywhere,\"\u009d he added. Their chatting excited. It is holiday time and I was driving my children to a near by eatery and had to pass through Ibe Road in Okota. The kids were seeing the newly reconstructed road for the first time for a long time. They knew how that road was before. Now, it is smooth and expanded.. This forced out those expressions from them. Never underestimate the observations of children. I kept quiet, hoping to hear more as I was really touched by the genuine and innocent expression of the kids. Nothing can be more fulfilling for an achiever to be so recognised by children. I thought of many things. Do children, at that level, discuss governance among themselves in school? They taught us civics at that level in my time but that did not include appraisal of political leaders. And I don't think my children were appraising Fashola even if their comments did. They were innocently expressing themselves. And they were not out of this world. Such expressions must be common in their school and other places children parley, so\u00c2 they were just expressing what they see and hear. If children could portray Fashola in the light\u00c2 pointed above, does he need vigorous campaigns to win election in this country? Can't his good works\u00c2 earn him not only another term but also greater heights in future? Interestingly, children don't vote and Nigeria is a country where the votes of the adults don't count. So Fashola must campaign, he must fight before and during elections to continue his good works. It is so\u00c2 because good things don't last in Nigeria. The many evil men\u00c2 in our society ensure this. But our innocent children and all men of goodwill will continue to pray for God's continued guidance of Fashola so that he will continue to soar, serving the people even better and sending a message of hope\u00c2 across the country, the kind of message Emmanuel Uduaghan is also sending in Delta even as Deltans lament over reduced allocations. I know about Fashola's vision, his seemingly unprecedented progress in Lagos but my children made me appreciate him the more. Reporting sports\u00c2 is my business and Fashola\u00c2 has also impressed in his own way in this area. He is rebuilding sports in the state. He has included sports in his community development projects and he hopes that Lagos, once a strong sports state, will return to their great days like when their great athletes ruled soccer, table tennis, boxing, track and field etc. Lagos may not boast of Premiership club now but a Fashola touch can change things. The best footballers will like to play for him, knowing that their welfare will be assured, knowing that if they leave the stage as heroes, they would one day be honoured in life and in death. The Sam Okwaraji case is a testimony. 20 years after this great Nigerian slumped and died while playing for Nigeria, Lagos State honoured him greatly. They did what Federal Government could not do. They did what Imo State, Okwaraji's home state,\u00c2 has not considered important. . Fashola's action is inspiring, it is rewarding, it is encouraging and can attract good athletes to Lagos. It is not only about sports. It is about recognising service to motherland. It is about inspiring patriotism and reworking Nigeria. Few days ago, he backed Lagos State Sports Writers Association of Nigeria, ably led by Niyi Oyeleke, to launch the Teslim Balogun Foundation, a foundation meant for the welfare of former players. And just on Monday, state commissioner of sports, Adeniji-Adele signalled the establishment of BRF Foundation, another foundation to cater for the welfare of athletes. Fashola has so touched so many areas that school children now sing song with his name. They hear their parents, teachers and other elders speak eloquently about his good works. They see too and,\u00c2 like my children, they know where he has visited. May Fashola visit you. May he visit my area, a new developing area with untarred road. May he score more goals in good governance and get the youth proudly singing THIS IS THE LAND OF MY BIRTH in an ascending high pitched tenor of Erik Donaldson and the elders chorusing\u00c2 Nat King Cole's UNFORGETTABLE.\u00c2 Years after he would have left office, many will always say \"Fashola was here.\"\u009d UNFORGETTABLE. ON BOARD TO BERLIN By the time you are reading this, I would have been on board to the Athletics World Championship in Berlin, Germany.\u00c2 Olympic Stadium is the venue. It was here that Jesse Owens performed the feat that so stunned Germans and their Adolf Hitler in the 1936 Olympic Games that they were reluctant to decorate the legend with his four gold medals. Jesse Owens was black American. Berlin is a place of history. Remember the Berlin Wall? Can you cast your mind back to the cold war years and appreciate these moments of peace, unity and free market economy? And just three years ago, Italy and France played here for the World Cup trophy. It was a match that many rooted for France but Italy went away with the trophy. It was a match that saw\u00c2 Zinadin Zidane end his career shamefully, bagging a red card for head-butting Matarazzi who had uttered obscenities to him. It was here that elegant Shakira so shook her waist in a closing ceremony performance that the whole stadium stood to admire her singing talent and the prowess under. Even those who sat to applaud good soccer moves had to stand when Shakira took the stage. I left the Berlin Olympic Stadium wondering if sex, as epitomised by Shakira on stage, is stronger than the passion of football. I leave this for experts. But I know that athletes will compel fans to stand on their feet here in Berlin. What happens when Tyson Gay and Usain Bolt line out for the 100m final? Berlin will be hot. And the Nigerian athletes? The last time they won\u00c2 medal in the World Championship was in Seville, Spain in 1999. Francis Obikwelu won a silver, 4x400m relay team anchored by Sunday Bada won silver and Gloria Alozia won another silver in the hurdles. Ten years on, Nigeria will be gunning for a medal. Track and field took such a plunge in Nigeria that the team will celebrate medal of any colour. The new board headed by Solomon Ogba is just about four months in office and will be lucky to leave Berlin with medals. They are hopeful. Related",

        "author": "Adisa\u00c2  Adeleye",
        "text": "By Adisa\u00c2 Adeleye HEGEMONY in political parlance would refer to 'leadership exercised by one state' especially in a Federation or Confederation.\u00c2 History reminds us of the example of Prussia in the conglomeration of German states in the 19th Century and how a great leader, Bismark outwitted all in making his Prussian State strong militarily and stronger, economically.\u00c2 The Prussian spirit was quite evident in the Germany of today \"\u201c strong and prosperous. It is obvious that the Nigerian history is replete with the experience of how the Northern Region has tried to exercise political leadership over the other Southern Regions before Independence and, how after 1960, some Northern States as a 'block' continued to exercise the assumed 'Leadership role' in a fashion not regarded by observers as in the best interest of the country.\u00c2 Simply, it is often being regarded as unenlightened selfish interest by other enlightened Nigerians. A recent case in point is the reported statement by the former Minister of Finance, Mallam Adamu Ciroma, warning the Federal Executive Council of the Federation (EXCOF) not to touch Section 144 of the Constitution _\u00c2 a section which has something to do with the capability of the ailing President.\u00c2 Mallam Adamu's argument appears strange to the extent that enquiring by Nigerians about the health of their President 'would amount to inflicting pain on the personality of the President'.\u00c2 Would Mallam Adamu have reasoned like that if the 'invisible' President had been a Southerner ? Definitely not. Analysts who are looking for sources of instability in the Nigerian political system should re_read Mallam Adamu's statement on the zoning system of his party. It reads painfully; 'the zoning arrangement is something which we, the people who formed the party discussed and came to a conclusion which we believe will serve the interest of this country better. The emphasis on we becomes more vague if the wider interest of Nigeria is envisaged. The statement further reads, 'after the death of General Sani Abacha', the wily Mallam continues,' it was we, people from this part of the world, or this part of Nigeria who decided that the next President should come from the South and we agreed that the rotation should be between north and south.\u00c2 It was the way events developed in the South that produced General Olusegun Obasanjo as the President and he was to act as President for two terms, and when he tried to extend his period, he met our resistance'. And Mallam Adamu Ciroma concluded,' the Party has said the North would retain power'\u00c2 If the powerful Northern block has spoken through the candor of Mallam Ciroma, the fight for electoral reforms becomes laughable and unnecessary. The 'Northern block' that anointed Obasanjo and provided him with a political platform (raw from his Ota farm), and also produced ailing Yar'Adua, is waiting to provide his successor through the same process _ voting through faulty electoral system. Nigerians should underrate Mallam Adamu Ciroma at their own peril.\u00c2 The Mallam, a cold and calculating politician, a History graduate of Ibadan University is a beloved son of the old conservative Northern block. He was stubborn and wielded a mighty pen in his fiery journalistic days.\u00c2 As an Assistant Secretary in Petroleum Resources Ministry, he was moved to Kaduna as the Editor of 'New Nigerian' _ a powerful voice of the North.\u00c2 Without training in Journalism, he was surrounded by a Northern Yoruba production outfit led by lat Rasak Aremu \"\u201c a gifted craftsman. With Adamu Ciroma at the editorial desk in 'New Nigerian', the war of 'uniform Price of Petroleum Products' was bitterly fought and won not for Nigeria, but for the North and the consequences of that wrong policy are with us today in the, culminating drama of Deregulation. For the understanding of the chaos in the downstream sector of the oil industry, I would quote relevant paragraphs on 'pricing of refined petroleum products' from my book, The 'Thunderbolt' published in 2002.\u00c2 'The present problems of instability in the prices of white oils \"\u201c gasoline (PMS) diesoline (AGO) and dual purpose kerosene (DPK) could be traced back to the late 1960s when the Northern elites started to clamour for uniform prices for all petroleum products and electricity tariffs. The enlightened advocates of a policy of 'uniform price' at that time were Mallam Adamu Ciroma, former editor of New Nigerian Newspapers (immediate past Finance Minister); Alhaji Ibrahim Dasuki, former Chairman of Northern Marketing Boards (ex Sultan of Sokoto) and Professor Ishaya Audu, a former Vice_Chancellor of Ahmadu Bello University, Zaria. 'Hitherto, prices of various petroleum products were agreed with government agencies by the local oil companies.\u00c2 On local products, each company would buy crude oil, refine to specification at the refinery (owned by government, B.P and Shell but managed by B.P) and pay agreed processing fees. 'The price fixing' was based on ex refinery cost (cost of crude and processing fees), handling charges, depot maintenance and equipment; government tax (where applicable) and transportation cost.\u00c2 The agreed pump price would have included all elements necessary to sustain the profitability of each company' 'However, the scene changed with the clamour for a uniform price regime throughout the country.\u00c2 The main argument was sentimental and specious as no distinction was made between the main products and industrial fuels.\u00c2 As a leader writer in one of the issues of 'New Nigerian' puts it, 'petrol price differentials constitute one of the running sores in the social and economic life of this country. Other strong arguments canvassed in the North were:\u00c2 that there should be no justifiable ground for discrimination in respect of prices of essential commodities because of geographical locations of areas; more rapid industrialisation if cheap fuel and electric power is available throughout the country.\u00c2 Uniform price of fuels and electricity throughout Nigeria would ensure even economic development and equality of public and general welfare' 'The craze for 'uniform price' in the north was so high that the average Northerner associated the lack of widespread industrial development to petroleum price differentials'\u00c2 All attempts at the period to convince the North on the problems of uniform price proved abortive. I (working with an Oil Company' discussed with Mallam Adamu Ciroma and some senior civil servants in Kaduna that supply of petroleum products alone would not explain the location of industries in the country as there were other complimentary factors, such as abundant materials, cheap labour, good roads, ready market, transportation cost. Also, differential prices of petroleum products like other commodities may be due to transportation costs as goods move from the supply points. In spite of stronger economic arguments, the pressure of the Northern lobby was too much for the government to handle.\u00c2 The advocates of uniform price had their way through Petroleum Decree of 1975 (as amended by Decree 32 of 1989).\u00c2 Thus, the government became for the first time, the fixer of prices of petroleum products through the NNPC which was given the sole responsibility of ensuring the smooth operations of the Decree.\u00c2 Oil depots were built and storage facilities provided in many States while the Petroleum Equalisation Fund was established to sort out the financial aspects. Today, uniform price could hardly be maintained anywhere with ease;\u00c2 it has broken down long time ago in the North inspite of billions of naira spent to ensure regular supply of petroleum products.

        "author": "Ikeddy Isiguzo",
        "text": "By Ikeddy Isiguzo FOR more than 30 minutes last week Wednesday, President Goodluck Jonathan had the time to ask players and officials of the Nigerian U-20 football team, \u201cHow are you?\u201d The session that saw him repeating the same question after each person was identified was meant to be a pep talk ahead of the encounter against England in a FIFA competition in Columbia. We are just concerned about how the President spends his time, actually Nigeria\u2019s time. With the myriads of challenges the country faces, it is unthinkable that the President of a country aiming to be among the top 20 global economies by 2020 could indulge in such trivialities. The session was unimaginative. The President had to repetitively inquire about the identity of the speaker at the other end, repeated the question about his welfare, told him how well the team was playing, and the satisfaction the results gave Nigerians. Then he reminded him that Nigerians were expecting the trophy. All this was taking place because Nigeria was among 16 countries that got to this stage of the competition. We were the only country whose President had time to waste in this way. Why would any leader congratulate his team for reaching the round of 16 in a competition that it finished third 26 years ago, and has been runner up twice since then? Is this borne out of lower expectations or a lack of respect for history? It is possible that while the President called, important matters of state waited. The President\u2019s priority was to get the players to defeat England. He gave neither reason for the importance of the call he was making nor any particular justification for expecting the team to beat England. We are worried about matters that consume the President\u2019s time. If he was calling the team for a round of 16 game, what will he do if the team at the quarterfinal, semi-final, and the final? What explanations can the President proffer for abandoning pressing national issues for the telephone conversation with a team that is participating in a competition that is seen purely as a developmental event? How would he clarify the poor attention the players got while preparing for the competition, which really is the time the President\u2019s men should have been motivating them? What really was the purpose of that call? Those involved in arranging the session , which the Nigerian Television Authority ably aired to international audiences, did a great disservice to Nigeria\u2019s image. They had no idea of the messages they were sending round the globe about the seriousness of the highest office in Nigeria. Is it imaginable that any leader elsewhere would have been involved in that prattle? Now that the team has made the quarterfinal, does the President realise that he has to talk to the players again? The team has fallen in line with the President\u2019s prompting. Some of the officials reminded the President that his good luck as Vice President saw the team to a second position in the FIFA U-17 competition Nigeria hosted in 2009. His talk with them, then, they claimed was the team\u2019s tonic. The message is direct and simple \u2013 the President should continue talking to the team if he wants good results, and the trophy. We object to a President who promises transformation of Nigeria investing his resources in grappling with maintaining minimal gains. Nobody who watched that performance will take the President serious, not even if the issue was football. It was cheap publicity well beneath the elevating office of the President of Nigeria. With all the good luck that was supposed to have attended the team because the President spoke to the team, it crashed out of the semi-final of the competition. Will the President maintain a tradition of calling teams when they play matches, matches at stages that are at their early stages? In case the President has form a habit of making such phone calls, he can restrain himself to when the teams are in camp, again away from public view. Some things must be beneath the President and remain so. We cannot have our President waste executive time on matters that diminish him and his office. The young men who went to Columbia should return to their trade, hopefully, they could make some progress in it. I also hope the lesson has been learnt that a presidential phone call is no substitute for good preparation. We should quickly put Columbia behind us, it is a continuation of the ills of football administration. What is left is to see how many of these players would graduate to the senior team.

        "author": "Kola Animashaun",
        "text": "By Kola Animashaun Early in life I had to choose between honest arrogance and hypocritical humility. I chose the former and have seen no reason to change\u201d-Frank Lloyd Wright The billionaire of the recently- rested News of the World, Rupert Murdoch, has been known for years, but not as much as he is now known. In recent time, his fame or notoriety has gone round the world. Murdoch\u2019s overweening political influence has long been recognised, from well before when the former British Prime Minister, Tony Blair, flew to Australia in 1995 to pay homage at his corporate court. It is said that those who knew him have the fear that those who crossed him would be given the full tabloid treatment over their personal misdemeanors, real or imagined. But Murdoch is a case apart, not only because of his commanding position in print and satellite TV, he played a crucial part in cementing Margaret Thatcher\u2019s political power and then shaping a whole era of New Labour/Tory neoliberal consensus that delivered enfeebled unions, privatisation and the Iraq war. Instead Murdoch who, should by now be living out the rest his life in ease and in comfort cannot do so as a result of the hacking implosion. He has made money in publishing and he owns some of the world\u2019s top 200 newspapers including Times, Sun and the then News of the World. He also has owns Wall Street Journal, these are not by all means all he own. He owns some in Australia where he was born as well as in Canada and so on. And, he has influential friends all over the world and Rupert is a citizen of at least three continents. By his own admission, he employed 53,000 people all over the world. On Tuesday, in front of the select committee, he let it be known that he had been invited to No. 10 by the former British PM, Gordon Brown, many times and he had always gone in through the back door to avoid the press! He was also invited by the incumbent Prime Minister, David Cameron to have a cup of tea as a \u2018thank you\u2019 within days of the general election last year. On his way back from Lagos, David Cameron declared it was essential to get the whole business into perspective, echoing Murdoch\u2019s insistence that his competitors had got up \u201cthis hysteria\u201d. The British prime minister rebuked the opposition party for \u201cchasing conspiracy theories\u201d and claimed it was really Brown who had been in the pocket of the global media billionaire. What is clear is, Murdoch is not very welcomed. The News of the World that he stated constitute only one per cent of his holdings has been his undoing. And the hacking impropriety was the cause of the demise of News of the World, until two weeks ago, was the most circulated Sunday newspaper throughout the world. It sells or it sold -7.5 million daily. It thrives or throve- on celebrities and scandals. It could have stopped on that until it stepped where angels dreaded to tread. Of course, it did a number of other things- like paying for information and crossed the boundary of decency. Politicians, rulers and ordinary people dreaded it and they all now have called its bluff. The phone hacking scandal finally tore into the heart of the British establishment. Murdoch is now 80 years and he usually bluff his way through. But, this time he could not. So, when the dam burst, it finds some policemen and journalists holding the baby. The metropolitan commissioner, Sir Paul Stephenson and the assistant Commissioner, John Yates, have had to resign their commission; Stephenson was linked to former News of the World deputy editor Neil Wallis in reports which said the police chief accepted a five-week stay earlier this year at a luxury health spa where Wallis was a PR consultant. Sir Stephenson said it was reasonable hospitality but could understand how it can be perceived by the general population. It is OK if it was reasonable hospitality and here in the UK it is a given that a public servant should declare such hospitality as long as it form part business, networking and improving the relationship between one company and another. This went beyond reasonable and borders on grand bribery so, it can be perceived by reasonable people that the gift was given to manipulate the person \u2019s judgment by financial or similar means. In IBB\u2019s regime, the then Minister of Petroleum, Professor Tam David-West drank tea and received a gold watch and IBB gave him a dressing down!.. The News of the World chiefs such as Andy Coulson and others are in hot water . The chief executive officer, Rebekkah Brooks, who had been editor of News of the World have resigned. The news came hours after the police arrested Mrs Brooks, \u2013 on suspicion of phone-hacking and bribing police. John Yates, second-in-command at the force, stepped down over his part in appointing former NOTW deputy editor Neil Wallis as a PR advisor to the capital\u2019s police force. But new accusations have surfaced that Yates also obtained a civilian police job for Wallis\u2019 daughter. RupertMurdoch had been contrite, he has wronged many people, especially those who have been affected by his paper\u2019s hackings. He has apologised to them and has paid compensation. All of them apologised to all concerned for the hacking abuses that was carried by rouge employees of News of the World. They, without exemption, indicated they had been misled and they promised that the abuses will not happen again! *I am currently in London and so all reactions to my Voice of Reason column be sent to 08083689552 or my mailbox kolanny@yahoo.com Thanks \u2013 Kola. +447579654447 Related",

        "author": "Rotimi Fasan",
        "text": "By Rotimi Fasan WHILE writing on the UK riots last August, I had, here, traced some of the impulses that gave rise to the riots to certain economic and social inequities within the British society. I did not stop at that. I had extended my reading of the developments in the British society with regard to the riots to what I saw as related developments in other parts of Europe and America. In what might have sounded then like an instance of scare-mongering, I had sought to draw a link between the riots and the Arab Spring that was nearing climax in Libya even as the authorities in Syria continued their brutal suppression of the sovereign will of their people. After the close shave in his mansion that took him to Saudi Arabia for medical attention, Bashar al-Assad is yet to buckle. Some kangaroo court in his control last week handed down harsh sentences to medical personnel it accused of treasonable conduct for providing care to individuals injured while taking part in protest against his regime. The jury is yet out on how the Syrian crisis might finally end. But there can be no doubt that Syria will never remain the same nor would Assad go scot free. Although still far from clear, there are signs that Europe and America might be experiencing their version of the mass discontent that impelled the Arab Spring. From Greece where youths have taken to the streets to protest against massive job loss and indeed unemployment following state-induced austerity measures, to Spain\u2019s groaning economy, things look dire in Europe. Britain is lost for an answer even as France makes middling attempt to put things right. But for Germany, matters might have boiled over. Even here, too, Angela Merkel nearly got her fingers burnt as she narrowly escaped revolt in her party. Otherwise, the story should be very different now. America, bastion of capitalism, comes increasingly within the heart of the economic chaos currently ravaging Europe. The youths are restive and angry at their leaders. The mass discontent across the country is being giving a face by the growing movement of angry young men and women who have been protesting around Wall Street in the last few weeks. What began like a child\u2019s play, a local incidence limited to New York, is now spreading like foul air across American cities. Young Americans, no longer content to endure what they see as the greed of the rich, symbolised by the big corporations and banks that populate Wall Street, are taking matters into their own hands in order to safeguard their own future and secure their cut of the American Dream that has become a nightmare for many of them. With tales of foreclosures, increasing joblessness and massive student loans to pay, the youths feel shut out of the proverbial dream that is there for the bold and resourceful. The Tea Party and their billionaire supporte rs might soon discover to their shame that a revolution, such as is gradually building across America, is certainly not a tea party as Mao warned decades ago. The solidarity that has bonded these youths together, the readiness to forgo immediate comfort in order to make a better future, the resourcefulness that has seen them pouring out of different cities to join the growing throng outside Wall Street are what might yet turn the Street into another Tahir Square. The social media are once more alive and in these age and time, the youths may not need more than these to effect what could redefine the face of capitalism in a manner Marx never imagined. And what is the inspiration for this current movement? The Arab Spring! With the battle cry of \u2018Occupy Wall Street\u2019, the youths are calling for a total rejection of the greed that has seen bankers not only profiting but raking in indecent profits in an inclement economic climate they created almost singlehandedly. The mess these bankers created from engaging in unseemly insider deals that saw them falsifying figures to create the illusion of growth for businesses gone comatose- such mess would be the model for Nigerian bankers with their \u2018round tripping\u2019 and other unethical deals that would eventually bring the entire economy down on its heels. Massive bailouts With tax payers\u2019 funds, as happened with the recapitalisation for distressed banks here, the American government provided massive bailouts for these huge corporations bankrupted by greedy bankers in the main. Rather than use the bailouts responsibly, the deal makers on Wall Street went on to pay themselves huge sums as compensation- for what really? What further evidence is needed to show the greed of Wall Street? Yet millions of Americans are poor and out of job. They lose medical cover and default on student and mortgage loans. But now they are saying enough is enough and those who have ears in that society would do well to listen or have reasons to regret their action later. The matter is getting gradually beyond Obama whose earlier initiatives to address fundamental issues of the American economy were spurned by Republican toughs, especially the Tea Party, who have turned the American society into one in which the poor must starve in order to oil the cloying palates of the rich. The insensitivity of the wealthy minority, backed by political power, is what young Americans are protesting against in their Wall Street sit-out. Let the reader ponder on my concluding comment on the UK riots in August: The West should prepare for more of this as laws are continually fashioned that favour the very rich at the expense of society\u2019s poor. The crumbling economies of Europe, of such countries as Greece and Spain and the introduction of austerity measures across the continent are the early warning signs. The ascendance and intransigence of ultra right groups such as the Tea Party in the US will ultimately push the poor majority of the so-called civilised world to the barricades and we would all find out just how civilised that \u2018civilised world\u2019 is. Republican insistence on cuts on government spending while giving lavish tax cuts to the rich and impoverishing young Americans would in due course boil over. It may for now sound so farfetched but what is happening in the UK might be the beginning of the West\u2019s version of what is now generally called the Arab Spring. Things may not take that shape immediately. But they might over time. Those who imagine that such eruptions could only happen in Africa of sit-tight leaders; those who fail to see the connection between such unrest and the enactment of corrupt policies that impoverish the vast majority would not see the point in this. But such would be surprised in no distant time. Related",

Excerpts: By Lucky Orji CRITICALLY examining Nigeria's polity since 1999, are we getting it right in policy making and execution? In 1999, a lot of factors came into play and metamorphosed into the present style and structure of today's political dispensation; the successive election annulments by the IBB regime, with the last one of June 12, 1993 which left a lot of cynicism among the beleaguered elitist political class. So what happened was that a lot of neophytes influx especially those from the contractor class who were either serving directly with the then military administrators as SSGs or those that were errand boys to some of the Lebanese gurus who had top military connections in Abuja emerged as governors, senators, etc. While all these was happening, those with the right pedigree for leading Nigeria stayed put and adopted a wait and see attitude while majority of them were either on self imposed exile or run-away NADECO chieftains who had gone underground to evade the Abacha manhunt for the opposition. The above scenario led to the emergence of a military transition that brought together strange political bed fellows, the original G34 group which had some semblance of ideological posturing was later hijacked into the PDP which was not a political party in the real sense of it, but a vote-gathering machine hurriedly put together to, at all costs, wrest power from the military. The aftermath of this scenario has left us witnessing policy somersaults with a very weak and defective constitution which does not capture the fundamentals of our uniquely diverse co-existence metrics, with inherited dysfunctional state institution. We presently have a socio-political and economic system where certain oligarchic interest have become more influential and bigger than the state institutions when it should be the other way round. We really have a lot of catching up to do but it suffices to say that one cardinal issue that needs to be addressed is the issue of renegotiating our terms of co-existence, the overhaul and production of a truly 21st century Nigerian constitution that will provide the platform for a distinct and clear landmark departure from the 49 years of our underachievement as a nation. You have so many re-brandings going on. One of them is electoral reform. Do you think reform is the solution to our electoral problem? Yes, our electoral system requires total overhaul. The Justice Uwais recommendations raised one fundamental issue which is the issue of increased autonomy for INEC. The appointment of the chairman of the electoral commission also is important and the certainty of his tenure also has to be guaranteed by the constitution with two thirds vote from the National Assembly to always ratify whatever changes are to be made in the modus operandi of the commission. Allowing the present INEC to continue with the business of conducting elections after the monumental irregularities and dismal performance of the last elections\u00c2 does not guarantee any good for us as a nation. Yes a holistic electoral reform with a thorough and comprehensive strategy that will include the inputs of all relevant stakeholders will go a long way in determining the quality of leaders that our elections produce. Do you believe this re-branding being carried out by the Ministry of Communication and Information would change Nigeria's attitude to government work and corruption? When you talk of a brand, you are talking of an image that is predictable and familiar with a majority audience. Like the brand Guinness which has been there since 1759, for any brand to be good, its contents must have substance that must be associated with consistent and predictable value to end users. Our contents as a nation need to first be imbued with value and substance, infrastructure, political stability, macro and micro economic organisation, national morals ethos and values, qualitative educational system, functional healthcare, efficient security system, etc. These are the contents that need to be built into a brand that will endure in the long-term. We need to go back to the basics as the re-branding Prof. Dora Akunyili has embarked on\u00c2 is nothing more than an academic exercise. Briefly comment on the CBN governor, EFCC and the bank CEO/MDs saga. This further lends credence to my hypothesis on the dsyfunctionality of our national institutions. These banks had licensed auditors, the CBN also has its own regulatory agencies that had to wait for Lamido Sanusi to come on board before action could be taken. The banking institution has always failed Nigerians as it doesn't\u00c2 exist for the statutory objective of providing capital to small and medium business which is the real engine of economic growth in any nation. Rather, it prefers to fraternise with politicians and dubious business figures who guarantee them higher returns on lending. The world is now a global village especially with the operations and interconnectedness of financial institutions, we need to take advantage of the mistakes of the global recession in the US and other developed economies to retrace our steps and take adequate steps that will insulate us against any major surprises, and also we need to strengthen legislation that will empower legitimate businesses with increased accessibility to funds to enable them drive the economy and create more jobs. Amnesty has been viewed by public commentators as a means of buying time by the Federal Government. What is your take on this? Amnesty legally should be granted to convicted persons, but, in this case, it is being granted to a generality of youths from the Niger Delta without any form of classification as to who deserves what, when and how. The Ledum Mitee report had a lot of recommendations and amnesty is just one of them. The fundamental issues of infrastructural as well as human development need to be seriously addressed or else the flashpoints of agitations expressing itself in varied forms will continue to re surface in the Niger Delta. As a Niger Delta chief, my candid opinion is that, apart from the defects on the side of government, we all have to look at the internal constraints of leadership in the Niger Delta, what have we done with the chunk we have received so far? The billions our governors pick up every month, how is it used? Because if we don't correct this, even if we start getting 50 per cent derivation, we may still not be able to apply it optimally for development purposes. We also have to be careful about the kind of precedent that we are setting by rewarding or calling militant leaders to Abuja and paying them hundreds of millions to give up the so-called struggle for emancipation, as this might have a devastating boomerang effect on the ethos of hard work we have all set out to imbibe in our young ones, as they might start misconstruing the bearing of arms as a significant route to reward and recognition in Abuja. The measuring line from my perspective is that what can be done in Abuja could also be replicated in the Niger Delta states without any form of foot dragging the roads in Abuja shouldn't be any better from the Warri roads. The airports schools etc should be vividly live and functional in all the Niger Delta states. All the above will be very functional if we have a truly Federal constitution that embodies our unique diversities and as recommended from the Willinks commission report of the 50s that the Niger Delta area is a unique ecological area which also requires unique and special attention. The struggle should be ideological and resorting to arms should be a last option which I don't think we require now. Related",

        "text": "By Ikeddy Isiguzo ON the eve of the African Nations Cup qualifiers in Abuja against Guinea, what is becoming a usual task came my way, an international radio station pulled a call through to me on Friday asking me what are the chances of the Nigerian Super Eagles. Pointedly, I told the reporter, \u201cMy mind deceives me to watch how the Super Eagles of Nigeria will make the nation unhappy with the outcome of the game.\u201d He then asked me for a possible score line, I volunteered, \u201cI do not see the Eagles soaring. I saw their wings clipped. My crystal ball showed a slim 1-0 score line which Guinea scored.\u201d A younger colleague who read the published version of the interview accused me of not being patriotic and nationalistic to which I replied in an instant message, \u201cBaba, I dey. Waiting for Siasia\u2019s Eagles like I said. My mind deceives me to watch them. Can they play well and win well? No. Or win but play badly. Yes. Uhm! Or will the table turn on our face with a slim goal. Yes. If they try better, disaster still looms somewhere.\u201d As soon as the match finished, he pulled a call through to me asking why I chose to use \u201cyour acidic mouth to nail the nation because I am always afraid of things you say about sports in this country. Consistently, you have proved some of these things so aptly.\u201d I only asked him. Can a bad person suddenly become good? To which he said, \u201cwhat if he is born again?\u201d I only laughed. Man is inherently a very consistent being. The religious \u2018born again\u2019 syndrome has never changed a man. Those who attempt change only left their beings to adopt new beings. There is vectored dislocation which normally is resisted and sustained but is not natural. Samson Siasia, for those who can remember, I said it shortly after he was appointed on Brila FM and on AIT\u2019s SportsFile Saturday morning programme \u201cis not a coach. He is the creation of the Nigerian media. He is primed to fail.\u201d I remember that there was a programme on Brila FM where my voice was repeated and so many of the fans who called in cursed and rained abuses on me. Some accused me of beefing Siasia and being jealous. Many of my friends who heard the programme begged me not to go against popular public tides. I remember telling Mrs. Oyekale radio curses have no potency. Some facts \u2013 \u00b7Siasia took Jos University Teaching Hospital FC to relegation as its chief coach. \u00b7Siasia took his native Bayelsa United FC of Yenagoa to relegation as chief coach. \u00b7 Kumbi Titiloye \u2013 now the administrator of Kwara Football Academy \u2013 introduced Simon Kalika to Siasia in 2005. \u00b7Siasia helped the Heartland FC of Owerri that played in the previous season\u2019s African Champions League final to a disastrous first round exit without winning a single match. That is the only game he has since 2005 played without his talisman, Simon Kalika! Had he brought in Kalika, he would have performed better. \u00b7 Our mutual coach in Maiduguri, Sebastine \u201cSabara\u201d Imasuen is still alive in Benin City. I do not want to remind him of the day, a player, he imported from Julius Berger FC of Lagos made him to shed tears due to the problem of discipline. Not too long, Sabara moved on to the national under-17 where he hit stardom as a coach. Our friend moved on to the senior national team. As a mafia, we all have fresh memories of their activities against coaches like Shaibu Amodu. \u00b7The Nigerian sports media remain one of the core problems of sports. They have consistently fed their reading, listening and watching public with misinformation and disinformation. They created the Siasia phenomenon as the El Dorado. What are their new defences? Siasia must have been sabotaged! I am waiting to read. Was it not on their sports pages he told us \u201cI am 10 times better than Amodu\u201d? Has he met any one of the three eras of Amodu\u2019s records in the national team? I siddon look. Waiting on Siasia\u2019s employers, the Nigerians Feeding on Football (NFF) as led by Aminu Maigari. In saner climes, they are supposed to wake the nation on Sunday morning with resignation after sacking Siasia. No. they will rationalise and continue the maladministration of Nigerian football as usual! You want to ask of the NSC and the Sports Minister? Please, go to sleep again. Olajide Ayodeji Fashikun olajidefashikun@gmail.com My Comments WOULD all have been well with our football if we qualified by the Nations Cup? I pity those who take our football serious. No organisation can stand for integrity with a flawed foundation. The elections of the Nigeria Football Association, NFA, should not have held. Many of us stated the elections massively violated NFA\u2019s Statutes, nobody listened. The problems of NFA, an organisation that illegally bears the name Nigeria Football Federation, NFF, are only beginning. Act 101 of 1992 established the Nigeria Football Association; it cannot change its name without amending the law. However, the National Assembly sees no illegality in NFA changing to NFF without recourse to the law. The National Assembly approves budgets for NFA and allows NFF to spend them. When an organisation (NFF) exists outside the law and benefits from legality (budget) it is sanctioned to promote impunity. Until we tackle the illegality of NFA, we cannot expect NFA to act legally. The National Assembly, for starts, should stop approving budgets for NFA until it is law abiding. We are kilometres away from making NFA law abiding, but little steps can lead to major changes. The tragedy is that a group steeped in greed of unimaginable proportions, acting above the law, has cornered our football. I made the above comments about our football at the beginning of 2011, incidentally in response to a piece that Mr. Fashikun sent. We are not ready to address our football. Congratulations to Siasia and his team for riveting our attention to the dying game. Related",

        "text": "By Is\u2019haq Modibbo Kawu THE American Secretary of State, Hilary Clinton, on being told that imperialism\u2019s \u2018revolutionaries\u2019 organised in the Libyan Transitional Council, NTC, had captured and killed Moammar Gaddafi in Sirte, tried an uneducated re-interpretation of Julius Ceasar\u2019s famous quote: \u201cVeni, vidi, vici\u201d, which translates from Latin to: \u201cI came, I saw, I conquered\u201d. Clinton\u2019s naked gloating over the public lynching of America\u2019s old adversary revealed the depravity of the leading politicians of the imperialist world, while underlining the length they will go to achieve their imperial aims in the contemporary world. It was clear that NATO\u2019s \u201cOperation Unified Protector\u201d was not about implementing UN Resolution 1973, but as Thierry Meyssan, writing for Voltaire.org said, was \u201cto overthrow a political system and to kill the leader, even if the assassination of a serving head of state is strictly prohibited by US law and universally condemned\u201d. It was also clear that NATO was not really enthusiastic about handing Gaddafi over to the ICC, because it was unlikely to be able to sentence him for crimes against humanity, anymore than the Criminal Tribunal for Yugoslavia was able to prove its case against former Serbian leader, Slobodan Milosevic, after two years of prosecution. The imperialist media parroted the same set of accusations against Gaddafi over and over, giving an indication that there was really little incriminating evidence which could hold in a court, against the man. One of the most repeated accusations was that he stashed away billions of dollars, but none of the imperialist countries: France, Britain or the USA that bunched together with their Gulf clients like the feudal Emirate of Qatar, was able to track the alleged fortune of the Gaddafi clan. Money seized in the course of the criminal aggression against Libya, belonged to the Libyan state, not Muammar Gaddafi. Interestingly, the only international arrest warrant against Gaddafi before the NATO aggression was issued by Interpol. He had been accused by Lebanon of having killed Imam Moussa Sadr and a group of companions in 1978. The imperialist media was silent on that warrant, because the kidnapping of Imam Sadr had been sponsored by the United States which wanted to get rid of the Imam, to prevent the spread of the radicalism which Ayatollah Khomeini had inspired in the Middle East. The imperialist media similarly conveniently ignored the role which Gaddafi played in the political life of countries like France, where Gaddafi illegally financed the presidential election campaigns of Nicholas Sarkozy and Segolene Royal. We must not forget that deeply ingrained in imperialist politics is immorality and gluttony. The same characters that sponsored the destruction of Libyan infrastructure had been lining up to kiss Gaddafi\u2019s hand in order to secure lucrative oil deals a few years ago as well as outsourcing to his security forces, the torture of Islamists. And as soon as the puppets of the NTC were knocked together, discussions emerged in imperial centres about the privatization of Libyan assets. They want to parcel out oil concessions, take over the ports and banks as well as other infrastructure. Libya will become a dependent protectorate and a NATO bridgehead for all sorts of aggression against African and Middle Eastern interests. I have never admired Gaddafi, who I think lived far more on the lunatic fringe to be able to understand the fundamental necessities for the revolutionary change that Africa required. He was too eclectic in his actions and too befuddled in his thoughts. He supported national liberation movements in Southern Africa alright, but was also the sponsor of bandits like Charles Taylor and Foday Sankoh. He was forever attempting to annex the Aozou Strip of Chad and in one of his most unforgivable crimes ever, he stormed a plane in Tripoli, arrested the leaders of the Sudan Communist Party and handed them over to another lunatic like himself, Gafar Numeiri, for execution, in 1971! He was forever blowing hot and cold and ran a most personalised regime which alienated the people and did not allow the development of the Libyan state; Gaddafi was the state! Nevertheless, despite all the imperialist media\u2019s attempt to delegitimize him totally, they could not erase the most important of his achievements. He overthrew the puppet monarchy which had been imposed by imperialism after the Second World War; he removed imperialist troops from bases in Libya; nationalized Libyan oil to serve the interests of Libyans as well as giving aid to impoverished African countries; constructed the Great Man-Made River (the largest irrigation project on earth). Thierry Meyssan said: \u201cLibya\u2019s development aid was more important than all the G20 countries put together\u201d. Well, as Hilary Clinton vulgarly declared, they went, they saw and he died. But imperialism will not have the last word in history! Those who accepted the NATO aggression against Libya and the public lynching of Moammar Gaddafi must remember the way that French troops also publicly defied Ivorian sovereignty a few months back, to invade the Abidjan presidential palace, to capture the recalcitrant Laurent Gbagbo. These are markers of the new imperialist attitude in Africa. The Americans have been shopping for bases to locate AFRICOM, the forward operational arm for Africa\u2019s re-colonization. It has been unpopular in the continent. But the new theory of linkage between AQIM, Al-Shabaab and Boko Haram, is becoming the red herring to interfere even more vigorously in African affairs. New secret bases They are planning new secret bases to launch drones against targets in Africa and already, they have been used against targets in Somalia, from secret bases in Yemen and Djibouti. West Africa will be targeted from secret bases in southern Algeria and with the imposition of a puppet regime in Libya, that country will enter the loop. In the long run, there is also the underlining rivalry between the old imperialist powers and the emergent nations, such as China, for Africa\u2019s natural resources. The Chinese method of offering infrastructural development, non-interference plus mineral deals, became popular with African ruling elites, to the chagrin of the Western countries, long used to a monopoly of exploitation of African resources. The battle for the economic domination of the world of the 21 Century will increasingly be fought on the African continent. Of course, imperialism will exploit slogans about democracy and human right, to try to claim the upper hand in that battle, because Africans want democracy and a respect for our human rights. But the history of slavery, colonialism and neo-colonialism, show that in the long run, imperialism cannot defend the values of Africa. Leaders who stand for an independent political or economic line, will suffer the fate of Moammar Gaddafi! But what really happened to President Jonathan at the Commonwealth Summit? THE AUSTRALIAN newspaper of October 28, 2011, carried a report written by Amanda O\u2019Brien titled \u201cGoodbye Goodluck, but Nigerian show goes on\u201d. The article talked about \u201cthe mysterious non-appearance of Nigerian President Goodluck Jonathan at a packed CHOGM forum yesterday where he was scheduled to outline his country\u2019s mining potential\u2026\u201d. Nigeria, O\u2019Brien noted, had \u201cone of the biggest delegations with more than 120 people and its towering President with his distinctive black hat ha[d] cut an imposing figure at the business forum all week\u201d. She added however, \u201cbut there was no explanation yesterday when he failed to appear for two scheduled speeches\u201d. But it was instructive that Nigerian newspapers had carried frontpage pictures of the president \u201cfeeding his wife, Patience, with a piece of cake to commemorate her birthday in Perth, Australia\u2026yesterday (October 26, 2011), according to THISDAY newspaper\u2019s version of the event. Was there a link between the birthday celebration and the \u201cmysterious non-appearance\u201d of President Jonathan \u201cfor two scheduled speeches\u201d, that Amanda O\u2019Brien reported in THE AUSTRALIAN newspaper? Well, Presidential spokesman, Reuben Abati, reacted the following day, denying reports that President Jonathan failed to attend the forums. \u201cI find the story mischievous and the innuendoes contained therein entirely misleading\u201d. Abati added that \u201cthe President was not scheduled to deliver speeches at two events on Thursday as claimed\u2026\u201d. In matters like that, the issue of trust creeps in; the reader might choose the side he believes! Northern Nigeria\u2019s education deficit LAST Friday, the Kano State Commissioner for Higher Education, Umar Doguwa, was reported to have lamented the falling standard of education in the state. He then revealed that literacy level was only 30 per cent in Kano, Northern Nigeria\u2019s largest state. It was also recently revealed that 70 per cent of school-age children in Zamfara are not in schools. The same depressing statistics can be quoted from several states in our region of Nigeria. For instance, in the same Kano, one out of every 14 children now lives on the streets. In the meantime, 45 per cent of the population is under the age of 15 while 70 per cent is under 30! We are clearly sitting on a keg of powder that might explode anytime! Fifty-one years down the road of independence, it is simply irresponsible that we have not instituted a compulsory educational revolution in Northern Nigeria. Until and unless we break the yoke of oppressive traditions, we will not achieve modernity. My experience of acquisition of both Islamic education and BOKO (and several others too!), shows that it is possible, if we put our hearts into it. I am a member of a new committee instituted by the Sultan of Sokoto to look at the various challenges we face in Northern Nigeria, and this is one of the central issues. We cannot become competitive in the post-modern realities of the 21st Century, when modernity in terms of education has continued to elude us! Related",

        "text": "BY: LES LEBA In spite of Organised Labour's recognition of the real advantages that a deregulated downstream oil sector would bring to the economy, there is yet no sign that Labour's opposition to this policy has waned!\u00c2 Labour, of course, recognizes that NNPC (Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation), like all monopolies (especially state run monopolies) create price and market distortions which do not generally favour the masses.\u00c2 Thus, even when it is clear that deregulation will not only release at least N600bn revenue annually for critical infrastructural upliftment, but also reduce the space for corrupt enrichment within the petroleum subsector and induce keen competition with improved consumer services, Labour is not convinced that deregulation would translate into cheaper or stable petrol prices, especially when global crude oil prices follow an upward trajectory. In truth, this column shares Labour's apprehension and I will even make bold to say that any assurance from any quarter that deregulation as proposed in its present jaundiced form will bring down petrol prices from its current level even when crude oil prices continue to rise must be a calculated attempt to deceive Nigerians, before our income values are taken to the cleaners! Indeed, Deregulation within the context of our current monetary framework will be suicidal!\u00c2 In their eagerness to encourage Labour to embrace deregulation, government and its agents have been quick to point to the gains in the telecom sector with the advent of liberalisation. In truth, prices of mobile handsets and cell rates have tumbled endlessly over the past five years and Nigerians are urged to be patient so that the same favourable scenario would play out in the downstream oil sector; but, sincere and insightful analysts will be quick to caution against such expectation. In the first place, competition may indeed have impacted favourably on consumer prices, but the more important fact is that it is the increasing size of the market (the cost benefit of mass production/service) that has been the main driver of the favourable prices! Secondly, and certainly of equal significance, price reductions are made possible with an expanding market in the telecom sector by the nature of its revenue base; for example, telecom operators receive their incomes in local currency (i.e. naira) from Nigerian based customers, and furthermore, the telecom operators do not have any direct influence on the determination of the naira purchasing power! Meanwhile, deregulation of the downstream sector may mean more suppliers, but the demand for petrol as in the case of telecom is unlikely to enjoy an astronomical increase, so the relatively static size of local demand for petrol will not increase and thereby instigate the cost savings that will ultimately reduce prices of petrol, especially when the crude oil market is buoyant! Thus, more refineries with increased capacities and an influx of importers will not necessarily increase demand such that prices will come down with the advantages of large scale production.\u00c2 Furthermore, it is clear that the universal driver of petrol prices is actually the international crude oil price movements.\u00c2 This is certainly the most significant factor in the pump price of fuel. Yes, the distance between refineries and the market, and the index of efficiency in each refinery would also contribute to the price level, but in reality, these two factors may not account for\u00c2 more than 20% in the price structure of petrol; however, the most critical factor that could induce wild swings in petrol prices is certainly the market price of crude oil. The price of crude oil is, however, denominated in dollars and unlike telecom, our export revenue is consequently received in dollars and not in naira.\u00c2 Meanwhile, the naira value derivable from this dollar revenue is in turn determined in a market which is inexplicably dominated and controlled by the worst form of monopoly (i.e. government parastatals). Thus, the foreign exchange market which determines how much our hard earned dollar income will command in the market, by its monopolistic nature, is plagued by price distortions, corruption, and market dislocations!!\u00c2 In spite of vastly increased export revenue, the monopolistic posturing of the Central Bank in the foreign exchange is in fact at the root of our underdevelopment! The CBN in its role position as the nation's banker is the prime custodian of our currency; i.e. the naira, and it is appropriate that it controls all naira issues and it is, by its mandate expected to maintain price stability which also includes an appropriate monetary framework which ensures that the naira we all earn does not continue to buy less and less in the market! Thus, while a Central Bank's monopoly of a nation's currency issue and management is universally accepted as inevitable, the waters become seriously muddied when the same Central Bank becomes not only a major player but also a monopolist in the supply of foreign exchange to the domestic market; this would lead us into a very poisonous matrix that guarantees that our people become poorer with increasing dollar export revenue. Currently, the CBN is annually responsible for about 70% of all dollar revenue that enters into the domestic forex market.\u00c2 The balance 30% or less is supplied by oil companies and a few exporters outside the oil sector!\u00c2 While these private dollar suppliers are legally permitted to approach the banks directly for the exchange of their dollars to naira, the owners of public sector dollar revenue in our reserves are not so lucky! Over the last three decades or so, the CBN has played the role of the all-knowing big brother with our dollar earnings.\u00c2 In the present framework, the CBN actually captures the monthly distributable dollar revenue, and proceeds, with no serious attempt at a market-determined naira/dollar rate, to print and supply loads of naira to the three tiers of government at its own unilaterally determined exchange rate! Consequently, with such framework, increasing dollar revenue will mean increasingly worthless naira value, as more and more naira will be pumped into the system with the attendant problems of excess liquidity, high interest rates, heavy government borrowing (not for infrastructural development but for reduction of excess cash in the system) increasing unemployment, lower demand and comatose industrial landscape as a result of CBN's monopoly of the people's dollar revenue! As you may imagine, the above is a veritable paradox, as increasing dollar revenue (whether from crude price rises or additional export revenue) should realistically improve the value of the naira if the increased dollar revenue provides us with longer forex demand cover.\u00c2 For example, our $60bn or more\u00c2 reserves in 2008 gave us over 30 months demand cover according to CBN and our exchange rate hovered between N120 \u2013 N150=US$1, but compare this with our $4bn dollar reserves and four month's demand cover in 1996 and yet our naira exchange\u00c2 in 1996 for just N80/$1. Some Nigerians have argued that crude oil is our natural endowment and we should therefore enjoy a subsidy akin to agric product subsidies elsewhere in Europe and U.S.A.\u00c2 Thus, even if a subsidy regime cost us N1000bn a year (a third of federal budget) or indeed breeds corruption and dislocates the price structure, such Nigerians maintain that subsidy is our birthright! I do not have any quarrel with this argument, but the point is that the concept of incidence of subsidy is misplaced in this instance.\u00c2 It should be a realistic expectation that when crude oil prices increase, our nation's treasury benefits with increasing dollar reserves, which would in turn improve our dollar demand cover; when dollar demand cover improves as per the above example, we should rationally expect our naira to be stronger against the dollar!\u00c2 A stronger naira, with rising crude oil prices should normally translate into reducing petrol prices locally!! The cheaper petrol prices will, however, mean higher cost to all cross boarder smugglers of petrol who have contributed to push our daily consumption of petrol over to 30 million litres!\u00c2 What our economic experts do not tell you is that the resultant stronger naira, cheaper petrol prices, the damper on inflation, and a savings of N600bn erstwhile subsidy are actually the real subsidies that ownership and export of crude oil provides! The so-called N600bn annual subsidy is a farce and contributes\u00c2 significantly to the destruction of our economy!\u00c2 The real subsidies that would impact positively on our economy when crude oil prices rise, are increased dollar reserves, stronger naira with cheaper consumer prices, increased employment, increased capacity utilisation, increased consumer demand and a general improvement in social welfare and security. So, this is the missing condition, if Labour must support deregulation without regret in the future, the CBN must be propelled to embrace a deregulated foreign exchange market.\u00c2 In such a market, beneficiaries of public sector dollar revenue will be paid with dollar certificates (strictly not cash).\u00c2 These dollar certificates can then be individually exchanged by constitutional beneficiaries from registered commercial banks!\u00c2 This approach will become a soothing balm to the economy and to the masses as we will begin our march out of the pits of poverty into which we have sunk. In conclusion, we reiterate that there can be no enduring deregulation of the downstream sector of the oil industry without first deregulating the foreign exchange market by compelling CBN to stop its current violation of the constitution with its capture of our dollar revenue.\u00c2 This advice can only be disregarded with great peril to our welfare!

        "author": "None",
        "text": "BY: LES LEBA Our Government and Organised Labour are once again for the umpteenth time in about five years embroiled in what may best be described as an unending petrol price control war, which was ignited over two decades ago with the drastic devaluation of the naira and increasing product prices.\u00c2 In his second term in office, former President Obasanjo floated the kite of deregulation to put an end to the endless attrition. We recall that the government had considered the existing N350bn subsidy on petrol prices at that time to be unsustainable and consequently accepted the advice of local experts as well as the IMF to completely withdraw any form of subsidy so as to engender a free market in the downstream sector of the petroleum industry.\u00c2 The arguments in favour of deregulation were truly unassailable; indeed, the argument recognized the reality that market dislocations, price distortions and parasitic supply chain often accompany monopolistic markets everywhere! In other words, prices of market offerings would be higher than normal as the monopolist controls market supply and prices for maximum profit.\u00c2 Of course, the situation could be expected to be much worse if a government agency (as opposed to private corporation) is the monopolist.\u00c2 Indeed, we can safely conclude that no government monopoly in any sector has succeeded in offering competitive and superior services to the Nigerian public! Thus, we recognize the failure of Power Holding Company of Nigeria, Nigeria Airways, Nigeria National Shipping Lines, Nigeria Telecom (NITEL); the list is endless!\u00c2 Indeed, in spite of the lucrative, substantial and captive markets available to all the above state-owned monopolies, they have all failed in meeting the expectations of Nigerians for competitive prices and better services.\u00c2 Indeed, most of these government monopolies have become moribund in spite of huge government subventions to supplement revenue derived from products and services offered! In the above event, it would require more than courage for anyone to vouch for best practices and the survival of any government trading parastatals without additional funding support to prop and cover up the 'worst practices' which have become their hallmark!\u00c2 Indeed, this scenario has become fully evident also in the domestic market for fuel, where Nigeria National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) monopoly of the downstream oil sector requires additional subsidy of over N600bn annually to stay afloat.\u00c2 Indeed, government sources lament the over N2,000bn burden that government paid to private oil marketers in the last 2 \"\u201c 3 years. We note that no other subsector attracted so much funding in the budgets for the period 2007 \"\u201c 9!\u00c2 Inexplicably, in spite of this huge subvention, fuel scarcities continue to persist, differential pricing similarly exists nationwide, and the direct benefit of allocating over 25% of federal revenue each year for oil subsidy remains unclear, especially as other vital sectors such as education, health, transportation, etc, receive relatively paltry allocations that would virtually make it impossible for our country to attain the\u00c2 minimum standards of welfare defined in the United Nations's Millennium Development Goals!\u00c2 Indeed, the subject of subsidy has become a great embarrassment to our government, such that in spite of the huge value of subsidies, no actual provision was made in the national budgets of the last three years!\u00c2 The relevant question here is, from which account, and with whose authority was the annual subsidy value deducted from the federation account? Our lawmakers, whose turfs have been violated by such executive unilateral impunity, surprisingly, do not seem to care, and have never queried such withdrawals without legislative approval!\u00c2 The apparent main focus of members of the Legislature seems to be in the magnitude and speedy disbursement of constituency project allocations, which many concerned Nigerians have alleged to be also without constitutional backing! So, in spite of the recognized faults in the system of budgeting allocation of resources to sustain a terminally sick NNPC at the expense of other vital sectors; why would 'Organised Labour' oppose deregulation of the downstream sector and the unbundling of the unwholesome monopoly of NNPC with the resultant expectation of annual savings of over N600bn which could fund welfare improvements elsewhere in the economy? Furthermore, why would Labour recognize that the current NNPC monopoly breeds and sustains corruption and yet insist that the defective and anti-people structure of this market be retained?\u00c2 If one was not aware of the antecedents of the leadership of Organised Labour, it would be easy to conclude that only self-interest would restrain the support of Labour for a the process that would bring down prices, provide better services and release or inject additional billions of naira revenue into the economy to address our infrastructural inadequacies and improve the welfare of the masses which the NLC/TUC represent. Even if Labour opposition may suggest anti-people posturing, this perspective will be grossly incorrect!\u00c2 Labour, without a doubt, is sincere in its apprehension that deregulation will not bring down prices and stem inflation with salutary impact on all income earners including that of its members, as per government's promises! Labour recognizes that the concept of deregulation is ideal, but they have learnt over the years to take government promises with a pinch of salt!\u00c2 In this particular instance, they intuitively know that something is amiss in the simple equation of deregulation = lower prices, but they cannot place their finger on the missing link! In any event, historical experience\u00c2 has demonstrated that local fuel prices rise whenever crude oil prices rise, and they cannot yet see what government can put in place to stem this sympathetic relationship between rising crude and local petrol prices, and recognise that not even deregulation as presently construed has the capacity to change this framework. An end to NNPC monopoly and introduction of market determined price regime may be expected to attract more importers and indeed serious investors in the provision of additional private refineries; but, it would be out of place to supply our crude oil to such refineries at a price below the current world market price for the commodity.\u00c2 Any attempt to do this would be akin to reintroduction of subsidy through the backdoor!\u00c2 Indeed, the potential abuses of such a system would create a bigger hole in our pockets than the erstwhile N600bn allegedly corruptly paid to fuel importers in the present regulated market. In addition, the attraction of cheaper petrol prices would lead to a huge leap in estimated domestic demand as our expansive boarders become porous outlets for servicing and subsidizing the fuel needs of Chad, Benin, Cameroon, Niger, Togo and other neighbouring countries. With the above scenario, Labour's demand that the four existing refineries be enhanced to produce at full capacity and that more refineries be built is obviously not the answer.\u00c2 Yes, more refineries may mean more fuel availability, but may not necessarily bring down prices, especially when international crude prices rise. Indeed, it is curious that in spite of Labour's awareness of the hundreds of millions of dollars 'wasted' on turnaround and other maintenance projects in our four refineries, the production stream still remains epileptic, and yet Labor insists that more good money (which could build new refineries and/or provide infrastructure) be further wasted on refurbishment as we have done over the years!\u00c2 Surely, the intention of Labour is not to encourage and sustain corruption, but the truth is that Labour is perplexed on how to put its best foot forward without becoming a victim of its own advocacy with regard to deregulation. Well, this is not really surprising as Organised Labour's traditional strategies of 'reduce price/increase wages or we go on strike' has worn thin and the futility of extended strike periods and subsequent capitulation as a result of public restiveness after prolonged deprivations and government's token concessions have also dawned on Labour.\u00c2 Meanwhile, there does not appear to be any constructive or solid palliative that would put a lid on fuel price hikes when crude oil prices rise in a deregulated market. Nonetheless, the possibility of petrol prices exceeding over N150/litre becomes more real with imminent economic recovery in Europe and America and crude oil prices once again approaching $100/barrel mark!\u00c2 \u00c2 \u00c2 So, the question of how deregulation can keep a lid on domestic fuel prices even when crude prices rise and fortuitously increase our reserve base is still left unanswered as there is no panacea to such a prospect! What should Labour do?\u00c2 Well, it is clear that Labour would have to think out of the standard box of strike action.\u00c2 Labour would require to take a closer look at the workings of the economy and the result of a monetary framework that guarantees that increasing dollar revenue creates problems of excess liquidity, high interest rates, high unemployment, rising domestic fuel prices and spiraling inflation. Next week, we will conclude this article on \"'Wetin' Concern NLC/TUC with Forex Market?\"\u009d and open a new vista of opportunity that would stabilize or indeed reduce petrol prices whenever price hikes occur in the international crude oil market.

        "author": "Paul Bassey",
        "text": "By Paul Bassey I thank God for the gift of life. I thank him everyday. Friday was not an exception. I told you how I was seconded to Benguela to help fortify the team on ground for what was expected to be world war four in African football. Egypt and Algeria were scheduled for their fourth confrontation after three World Cup matches that produced Algeria as World Cup qualifiers and ugly incidents outside the field of play. Benguela was the venue of the match in which Egypt wanted to use in proving that they not only deserved to go to the \u00c2 \u00c2 \u00c2 World Cup, but was also anxiously pursuing a third consecutive Nations Cup diadem, history by all standards. I want to confess that pre-match tension could be cut with a knife, especially when Algeria informed that they were going to storm Benguela with four chartered planes of supporters. At first I thought it was a psychological gimmick. How were they going to get visas for a thousand supporters? How will the Angolan immigration handle the crowd? Any way I still believed it was a stunt until we were informed that the planes had started landing. On the field, I knew we were in for a classic. On the field, I knew were not likely to have problems. Two members of the executive committee of CAF were from Algeria and Egypt. A preview in the CAF Web site said it was a match of reconciliation, so I rested easily,\u00c2 ready to enjoy myself. The rest is now history. Egypt won four \u2013 nil in what turned out to be an anti-climax. Friday morning I headed for Benguela airport to return to Luanda. Th authorities informed that the plane that was bringing the Super Eagles to Benguela for their third place match was also going to take the Egyptians to Luanda and that there was a seat for me in that aircraft. The flight was for 10am and by 9am I was at the airport to meet the shock of my life. The airport was literally strewn with hundreds of Algerians. There were green and white clad individuals on the lawns,\u00c2 departure lounges, every where, waiting for departure. Why didn't\u00c2 they\u00c2 take off yesterday? Why were they still here? That question could not be answered because before I knew it, I was surrounded by five youth asking whether I was yesterday's referee. I said I was not. Then who was I? I sensed trouble. I said the referee was a younger man, just as I pointed to some strands of grey hair on my head. They were not satisfied and came nearer. By this time, the number had risen to about a dozen. You see in CAF, we travel in official uniform and this was my undoing. They said I was CAF, that there was no difference between me and the referee that was sent to kill them. They started raising their voices as their colleagues joined them, just as I was moving back to my car\"\u00a6\"\u00a6\"\u00a6jumped in and told the driver to return me to the hotel. Austin Akosa had seen me off.\u00c2 He is the Benguela Centre Protocol Officer. When he saw me return, he wondered why and I related the whole story of how I was going to be mobbed, he had a good laugh after which he said \" na God save you\"\u009d \" Na God sir, na God \" I concurred. Golden bronze Look out for this headline, because it is a very popular one. The Nigeria media relishes in hiding her dissappointment under headlines that celebrate nothing out of something. History has it that we will win the bronze. We won it in 1976, beat Tunisia in 1978 and Mali in 2002 and 2004. Another bronze is on the cards. Why not? A shirt for Pappilo Since coaches use classification matches to give playing time to players who could not feature in the competition, I expect our non-playing captain, Papillo, to lead out his wounded army Saturday, except Coach Amodu considers the bronze as very important, he may still retain his non- scoring squad against an Algerian team that has been decimated by red cards.

        "author": "Bisi Lawrence",
        "text": "By Bisi Lawrence August 27, 1985. Enter Ibrahim Badamasi Babangida, on the day Buhari received his marching orders. It was really not his first appearance on to the Nigerian political stage. the first was on February 13, 1976. The Nigerian Head of State, General Murtala Mohammed had been assassinated in a coup d' \u00c3\u00a9tat that shocked the nation. He had proved to be a different kind of military ruler from his predecessors. He seemed to genuinely want a new beginning for a nation which had tripped itself up on the way to an assured glorious future. The subsequent deadlock which built up around the Radio Nigeria Broadcasting House at Ikoyi created an anxiety that everyone wished would end quickly. That was where the coup leader, Lt. Colonel B.S. Dimka, was holed up. Eventually, Lieutenant General Theophilus Danjuma, who was Chief of Defence Staff, ordered that the Radio Nigeria Buildings be leveled to the ground. The officer in charge of the operations was a handsome, dapper officer named Ibrahim Babangida. Thus entered one of the most charismatic and controversial figures upon the Nigerian historical scene. He eventually effected the rout of Dimka from the Broadcasting House without any loss of civilian life. Many of us still feel grateful to him to this day for saving our lives. You see, I was then the Controller, National Programmes, of Radio Nigeria. And it was effectively my station that Dimka had taken over. for quite a while, I felt close to the gentleman who had risked his career, and indeed his life, to save so many souls including mine, since it turned out that Danjuma was rather miffed that his orders were not carried out to the letter. In fact, the man seemed to have worn that grudge on his sleeve for several years, and probably up till today. I need not tell you my feelings about a man who ordered that I should be killed and then continued to be annoyed that God did not give me \u00c3\u00a4 prey to his teeth.\"\u009d I need not tell you about my feelings, either, concerning the man who saved us. So when he made his second entry on the Nigerian stage as the leader of a successful military take-over of government, I was not entirely discomfited. In fact, several groups actually made a song and dance about it. I had no doubt in my mind that he would make an outstanding success of his essay into national leadership. He seemed to have such high hopes for his country. One of those hopes to which he gave public expression, and which totally captivated my imagination was the idea of the two-party system. I remember listening to the lucid (if almost lewd) summary of the political suasion which he approximated, in its differentials, to \"a little to the right, and a little to the left.\"\u009d That was, in fact, the basis of June 12th. That was what provided the saddle upon which it could ride, in the first place. And then the \"Option A4\u2033 cleared the course for a glorious canter to the \"freest and fairest election\"\u009d ever held in post-independence Nigeria. Ibrahim Babangida was the main architect of it all. Not many people now remember what the chaos was like in the number of political parties that were lined up to take part in the elections that were expected to replace the Babangida government in the mid 'nineties. Hardly anyone, in fact, would wish to remember. When it seemed that almost every party had the letter \"P\"\u009d in its initials, one came up with that letter as all its initials \u2013 the \"PPP\"\u009d. Some people looked over the conglomeration of strange bedfellows who were grouped together in the same parties, and decided that what was the most common element went beyond mere initials, but centred on the main objective \u2013 which had to be the size of the \"take-away\"\u009d jackpot expected. Facing the truth of the matter squarely, they named their party, \"Chop-I-Chop Party\"\u009d. It showed the spirit of the times. Nigerians were into how to become millionaires without tears. Social parties were the scenes to reckless spending in a spree termed \"spraying\"\u009d. The politicians had found their way to becoming \"professionals\"\u009d. The situation might have been seeping into our lives over the years, but this was the period when it became congealed. This was when it became clear that you could make a career, a life-time career, out of being a politician. The days of being a lawyer or a successful professional aspiring to statesmanship were slipping away; the season of dabbling in politics to make a contribution of sorts were over; the era of serious-minded protagonists who actually held lectures and wrote books about their vision for the country was at an end. In fact, the exposition of a vision for the nation encapsulated in a manifesto of the political party was going out of the accepted norm. It was all diverted into a stream flowing \"a little to the right, a little to the left\"\u009d. But it seemed to work, and might have worked for some time. The abrogation of June 12 would now never let us know. The two-party system that was handed over to us was, in effect, one party under two different names. Everybody wanted sound education, thriving industries, excellent health delivery service, motorable roads, and superb security. We wanted it the same way \u2013 maybe \u00c3\u00a4 little this or a little that way.\"\u009d But how? In what way and by what manner or means? That is the rub. In retrospect, I have always wondered how a government without a distinct opposition would fare in \"democratic\"\u009d government, and that would have been the proposition before an Abiola government. It might have been a set-up designed by a genius who knew where to wait for the bus to come aboard. That government would have been squeezed together like an accordion in no time, and the \"maestro\"\u009d waiting in the wings would have had little difficulty claiming the palm. If you do not really know what I am talking about, just think of what happened after the crush of June 12. The political parties came up in their numbers again, didn't they? And then resolved into one mammoh party with little satellites \"beeping\"\u009d around it. The \"mega-merger\"\u009d of a party that is being trumped today around merely makes the mammoh stronger. A man who said he came from \"the valley of the shadow of death\"\u009d, rose to the peak of autocracy to impose his own style of life on all around him. Everyone seemed to have removed how to oppose out of his or her thinking, because they were all pulling in the same direction anyway, and that is towards the \"take-away\"\u009d banana. The man who carried away the prize was not the architect, the originator; he was the one man the architect could not deal with \u2013 deterred unfortunately by the \"code of honour\"\u009d of the uniform. Maybe he could have done worse or better, in a situation where what is better for some may be worse for others. That is the story of our \"nascent\"\u009d democracy\u2026 no guiding principle, no credo, no ideology. And, by the same token, it will remain that way \u2013 \"nascent\"\u009d \u2013 for the next twenty years, or longer. A discussion about nationhood in the 21st Century, especially as it affects Nigeria, must naturally touch on democracy. But most people hardly appreciate what democracy really entails, preoccupied as they are by what it gives as distinct from what it demands. Even those whose existence openly stands in the way of democracy, blandly proclaim its virtues in the self-delusion that others are thus deceived, or impressed. This, for instance, is the system of governance that demands the representation of every section of the community in the making of policy decisions. Thus it offers full participation on an equal basis to the masses in the determination of their own fate, and further provides a stronghold against bias and domination. But, I will say it again; we can only have democracy if we are prepared for it. We must deserve it through sacrifice and unflinching self-reliance to reap its dividends. It will not rise out of any document, or reform. It is not produced from positions or movements \"a little to the right, a little to the left.\"\u009d The Constitution of the Republic of Nigeria (1999) stipulates, as an ideal for the promotion of national unity, that \"there shall be no predominance of persons from a few States or from a few ethnic or any other sectional groups\"\u009d in the composition of the Government of the Federal Republic of Nigeria or an of its agencies. (Cap. 14(3)). A Commission exists for the observance of this provision, the violation of which should be justiciable. So, how many times has this been seriously raised as an issue in the past ten years? And yet, just look around you. At one particular time, the top hierarchy of various areas of government, especially Sports, was awash with elements from the same part of the country. And no feathers flew in any direction\u2026whether \"a little to the right or a little to the\u2026\"\u009d. I am very grateful to all who expressed their concern about my health recently. I now feel much better. The good wishes came in different ways. There was the note from Jide Oguntusin who is fourteen. \"You cannot begin to fall sick now when I am beginning to understand you enough to enjoy your column,\"\u009d he writes. \"I hope to be reading it even at fifty\u2026\"\u009d\u00c2 Wow! Some even went further to offer prescriptions. Clearly ahead of others is this one from someone who honours me with the fond title of\u00c2 \"uncle\"\u009d. \"Uncle, sorry you have been under the weather. Next time, try a 'NADECO SPECIAL' \u2013 one shot of gin, brandy, tia maria, campary and seven-up. I swear by it. Professor Bolaji Akinyemi.\"\u009d Time out. Related",

Umaru Yar'Adua had breathed his last, Wednesday and was buried Thursday.\u00c2 He had been enjoying his presidency. He meant well.\u00c2 You could see that from his eight years governorship in Katsina.\u00c2 He set out some programmes and the politicians, with a eye on their own advantage, made sure they did not fly. Umaru set up the record of veracity.\u00c2 He would say it as it was.\u00c2 And he meant to right it but he could not now do so. Umaru got the honesty he displayed from his father who was a minister for Lagos \u2013 the first Musa Yar'Adua.\u00c2 The same forthrightness the father, Umaru Yar'Adua displayed.\u00c2 Both do not play Do-or-die politics.\u00c2 Also Umaru's elder brother, Shehu Yar'Adua, let the Head of State stool pass to Obasanjo and served him without reservation.

Sikiru Ayodeji Shitta-Bey (1931 \u2013 2010) And come he slow or come he fast, it is but Death at last. -\u00c2 \u00c2 \u00c2 Sir Walter Scott, English Statesman (1771 \u2013 1832. I had been laid low by the death of a senior friend, Senator Sikiru Ayodeji Shitta-Bey, Seriki Muslumi of Lagos.\u00c2 Sikiru needs no introduction.\u00c2 He was lawyer, politician and religionist.\u00c2 On top of that, he cam from a very pure pedigree as they came. A great-grandson of Muhammad Shitta-Bey and princess of the House of Kosoko, which he valued in his discussions.\u00c2 What other things he mentioned with relish, what the fact that he was a double Kings College man: He never forgets that he attended Kings College in Lagos and he was an alumnus of Kings College, London.\u00c2 He was a proud man \u2013 proud of his achievements. We met the first time at the House of Representatives in Tafawa Balewa Square in 1965.\u00c2 He was legislator and I was the Press Officer to Okotie-Eboh, (otherwise Festus-Edah), Minister of Finance. He had, after that, moved on to be a Senator of the Federal Republic and also become the VIth Seriki Muslumi of Lagos.\u00c2 His grandfather was the First.\u00c2 His grandfather contributed to the building of the first Lagos Central Mosque and the Shitta-Bey Mosque in 1894. Sikiru excelled in his law and in his politics and he can be numbered as a founding father of Lagos State.\u00c2 For that he had a \u2026.. of followers. You can run\u2026 A se gbe kosi \u2026 A se pamo lowa (You can run but you cannot hide). Lagos Boy, Bode George, a chieftain of the PDP, must have cursed the day he joined the PDP.\u00c2 He never thinks that a day will come when he will go to prison.\u00c2 Not even did he go to jail everything possible has been made him to stay there. In his days, he was as free as the air.\u00c2 Not only that he moved from State Houses to Aso Rock, he called the shots and he thought his word was law. He could not believe he could go to jail.\u00c2 He was so sure that he went to court with all the PDP with aso ebi and the retinue of band.\u00c2 He as so sure he will be freed. Not long ago he moaned, he was abandoned by his political friends and associates.\u00c2 The man he saw every day in Aso Rock did not want to see him.\u00c2 Now, he thinks it is about time people rally round to give him moral support. So, Obasanjo has appealed to his supporters to visit Bode at the prison.\u00c2 Such is life.\u00c2 No one is invincible. This morning I remember former Council Chairman, Lukman Ajose.\u00c2 On March 31, this year, he was sent to the stammer for 8 years to run concurrently for\u00c2 2 years each (on four counts). He was sentenced by the same Judge Oyewole who jailed the Lagos Boy, Bode George.\u00c2 Ajose was charged with \"enriching himself by fraudulently converting the money belonging to the council for seminars and courses which he never attended.\"\u009d Lukman claimed to have attended several seminars and training outside Lagos but were found out to be false.\u00c2 The judge did not ask for option of fines.\u00c2 Ajose earned jail eight years after laving office. Ajose must have been especially found out.\u00c2 Thousands of council workers have used the seminar to fend for themselves without going to seminars.\u00c2 The government will have to do something about that.

        "text": "By Ochereome Nnanna THAT was the second time it was happening. When the Nigerian National Anthem was played before the commencement of the World Cup qualifier between Nigeria and Mozambique in Abuja on Saturday, October 10, 2009 , rather than obeying Nigeria 's call, a large section of the football fans booed. And only last Saturday they also hooted rather than sing when our anthem was played before the start of the FIFA Under-17 soccer championship between Nigeria and Germany. It is unprecedented even in this country whose many musicians have told Nigeria off in tones ranging from the mild (Nigeria is a Sleeping Giant) to the vicious (Nigeria jagga-jagga, everything scatter-scatter). Yes, a good number of musicians have sung patriotically about our dear Nigeria , but deep inside they know there is really no other basis to boast or be proud of Nigeria apart from the fact that this is the only country we have. Traditionally, it is anathema to own up publicly to the fact that your mother is a bad cook even if she is. I find it very disturbing that it was in Abuja, the seat of power and capital of Nigeria , that this open expression of disgust is coming from. Abuja has the best that Nigeria can offer, and its residents benefit from its ambience whether directly or vicariously. If Abuja residents can boo at the National Anthem, one of the symbols of this nation, then what do they expect the displaced people of Bakassi, Niger Deltans and other deprived groups to say? It is obvious that the beef of Abuja soccer fans against Nigeria goes beyond the consistently poor outings of our national teams in international championship soccer. The free-fall of Nigeria in soccer, the only aspect that binds us together, is a symptom of the disease in a system that increasingly has little or nothing to offer its citizens as dividends of governance. Last Sunday, the Minister of Defence, retired Brigadier General Godwin Abbe and his colleague in the Ministry of Information and Communications, Professor Dora Akunyili, met senior editors at the Sheraton, Ikeja. A prominent Abuja bureau chief of an equally notable national newspaper, during the question and answer session observed that our media managers knew that a lot was wrong in our preparations to host the world but chose not to report them. When Madam Akunyili had the opportunity to speak, she thanked the editor profusely and remarked it was exactly what re-branding Nigeria was all about. It is a matter for debate as to whether Nigeria's public affairs (the good, the bad and the ugly) should be laid bare or concealed in the name of re-branding. I am not quite sure whether concealing the ineptitude and corruption of our public officers which led to those disgraceful shortcomings was more patriotic and in the nation's greater interest than disclosing them. However, one thing has become clear: Usually, those who carry megaphones proclaiming the greatness of Nigeria and pontificating about their own patriotism are usually public officers-in-office. Few of them continue to spread the good news when they are no longer in office. It is their job to do so because their public office ensures that they enjoy free of charge the very things that ordinary Nigerians have to pay through their noses to afford (and those who cannot afford have to do without). Apart from the fact that Nigeria is \"our own dear native land\"\u009d, those who run the affairs of the nation have not justified their call on us to obey when we hear \"Arise, O Compatriots\"\u009d. We cannot elect our leaders. Our leaders are the ones who put themselves in power over our votes, and they are not willing to reform the electoral process to give us our power back. Why should we listen to Dora Akunyili's re-branding campaign when she was the one the Yar' Adua regime mandated to announce to the nation its refusal to implement changes articulated by the Justice Muhammadu Uwais Panel? How can you re-brand Nigeria when you retain the President's power to nominate officials that will conduct elections in which he and his party are partakers? Today in Nigeria, citizens have to provide their own electricity. They have to send their children to private schools if they hope to give them good education. They have to arrange for their own security to reduce their chances of being victimised by criminals. And now, the latest act of \"self-governance\"\u009d which the citizens have been forced to adopt is provision of their own roads! We have complained bitterly about the state of federal roads in Lagos , especially our economic main artery (Oshodi \"\u201c Apapa Expressway) and our petitions fell on deaf ears. The roads around Berger Bus-stop and flyover had become so deeply scarred that it was a nightmare for those of us working in Vanguard and The Sun to get into and out of our premises. I expressed the fear that a fuel tanker might fall into one of these gorges, dump fuel and ignite a fire that could consume everything in the vicinity. Happily, someone decided to take up the challenge by dumping tipper loads of laterite to close some of the holes. The bottleneck has cleared and potential disaster averted, at least for now. There is a contract between the state and its citizens. The citizens obey the law and pay taxes. The state provides basic amenities, good governance and security. But when the state is no longer forthcoming with its indebtedness to the citizens it loses it authority to call citizens to pay their civic debt. Related",

        "text": "By Bisi Lawrence How do you like your \"MJ\"\u009d served? Medium rare? Piping hot? With ketchup, cole slaw and all the trimmings? You can have him any way you want for the next few weeks, or so, and then you will have to release him to history, for that is where he now belongs. Actually, Chubby Checker was more up my street. I had a \"stroll\"\u009d, you might say, with Aretha Franklin, the Supremes, and those Motown quartets who, with James Brown, actually started with the Detroit music factory. But talking about \"black music\"\u009d, I was really more inclined to the Swing Era rather than the Soul Age. I was wrapped up with the music of Louis Armstrong, Duke Ellington, and Count Basie; Sarah Vaughan, Ella Fitzgerald \"\u201c and even Nat King Cole and Sammy Davis (Junior).. You know, stuff like that. On a dark, sultry night, I guess I am still quite a part of such carrying-on. And that was the way it was, until I linked up with this cherub-faced bundled of sheer music, with every fibre of him a sweet, sweet sound \"\u201c Michael Jackson. I can't remember when I first heard him, but I do remember the song \"\u201c \"1-2-3\u2033, a song for the young which left the old calling for an encore. He was fronting the \"Jackson Five\"\u009d, and the driving seat suited him to a \"t\"\u009d. After that, this \"whiz-kid\"\u009d slew me with \"Blame it on the Boogie\"\u009d. But the truth is that by the time he started doing the \"Moon Walk\"\u009d I had dropped out. It is not easy to sing the same song with great enthusiasm along with your own children, unless it be \"Happy Birthday to You\"\u009d, or a hymn of praise. What I am saying is that by the time Michael Jackson was at the crest of his prowess, I was really no longer a part of the scene. I had gone back to my Duke Ellington and Count Basie, to say nothing of Miles Davis the Modern Jazz Quartet. But still identified, to some extent, with the presentations of Michael Jackson. I felt he was trying too much, doing too much. He was like a runner who was miles ahead but was still straining hard to increase a lead no once could really ever catch up with. It was a kind of gut feeling I had, having seen what happened to Sammy Davis and some of the other \"brothers\"\u009d. The performance-enhancing drugs that make it all possible would have to take its toll at last. You have only to step on a stage in front of an audience that was expecting a great performance from you through the promise of your reputation, or by right of the money they have paid to watch your act, to know what the pressure, the monumental stress of a public appearance could be. But now we are talking not even about one single performance, but a continuous series of appearances over a considerable period, in the midst suffocating competition, and in the face of fierce criticism. It was easier for artistes whose performances did not demand too much of a frenetic presentation, that is, generally. But even in that area, singers still go through soul-searing exertions. For instance, Perry Como was a balladeer whose delicate rendition of sentimental songs was so soothing they called him \"Mr. Relaxation\"\u009d. Little did so many people know that he had to keep a psychiatrist on his staff for the stability of his own person. Michael Holliday who died at a much younger age than Michael Jackson, in fact, ended up in an asylum. His style too was so much \"laid back\"\u009d that, as someone described it, it was as if he sang directly and only for you. But he was living on his nerves until they were strained to a breaking point. Even here in Nigeria, we saw it happen to some of our artistes. The example that comes readily to mind, of course, is Fela Anikulapo-Kuti. I can't think of Michael Jackson without thinking of him. He was, first and foremost, a professional with a massive measure of talent. The instrument he was identified with at the last was the saxophone, and he taught himself how to play it. He began with the piano and then switched on to the trumpet, which he probably felt was the instrument of bandleaders, since he had always wanted to lead a band of his own. But he was not well received at the beginning. His music simply had no appeal. We got to talking about it one day, and he challenged me introduce him to a tune illustrative of what I had in mind. That was how \"Ojo t'o su\"\u009d and \"Oloruka\"\u009d came to life. Both titles were developed from one song and from there his genius took over. Fela called himself \"Abami Eda\"\u009d. Many people found it easy to translate that as a \"strange person\"\u009d, or an \"unusual person\"\u009d. But it could also mean a \"spirit incarnate\"\u009d, or in stark terms, a \"demon\"\u009d. In fact, Fela himself once declared that he was \"possessed\"\u009d by a demon. He said it happened in the United States, but none seemed to pay any attention to him. But later, on, I was a bit disturbed by the fact that this \"total\"\u009d musician seemed to have two personalities, as he virtually changed his nature. Before that trip to the United States, he was a sober, very polite and calm person \"\u201c in fact, sometimes almost shy, except when among his friends. But his personality suddenly seemed capable of assuming another dimension \"\u201c that of a loud, vicious character \"\u201c once he was on stage. He divested himself of his upper garments and publicly \"got high\"\u009d on stimulants. I began to pay more attention to his \"shrine\"\u009d activities and became somewhat uncomfortable with them. Even as you read this, are you not somewhat startled that no one has been able to really play Fela's music apart from his won, Femi? And I challenge you to play his song, \"Wahala\"\u009d every day for seven days, without experiencing the real thing!. In the same vein, I doubt if anyone will ever sing Mike Jackson's song like \"The King of Pop.\"\u009d He too was a professional with a monumental talent for his art. He was sober, respectful and very calm, until he got on the state. And then he gave himself up to his \"must\"\u009d(?), as if possessed by a principal spirit. That is why I prefer my \"MJ\"\u009d served as he was in \"1-2-3\u2033. I finished my Saturday shopping, two Saturdays ago, at the Apapa shopping area, and ran smack dab into a traffic logjam just at the base of Randle Street where I could turn back to Wharf Road. That I did with the intention of avoiding the traffic, which was in a total mess ahead. My intention was to get on the Express and turn back on the Badagry interface to cruise down my abode in Upper Badia. From the shopping centre home would have taken about twenty minutes on a normal day, but it was doubtful that the traffic would be better in anything less than one hour. On the other hand, the route I had chosen would normally take about thirty minutes, so I felt I had made a good decision, to get home from a shopping outing. The time was a quarter-to four, the air was clear and the first two kilometers of the journey passed in less than two minutes. Eventually, however, the journey took over five hours. I arrived home at five minutes past nine in the night. I was still one of the fastest motorists to go through that hellish road that night. The resultant aches and pains that came all over me are still with me. I have had to change some components of the clutch of my car. All for driving over a route of no more than ten kilometers in a city, on the return from a shopping trip. The problem was compounded of very bad road surface, broken-down vehicles and inadequate traffic control. In fact, there was no traffic control at all; the police were nowhere in sight. But God was kind to us. It did not rain or we would have shared almost the same fate with Soddom\u2026 and that other place. That road is plied over by heavy trucks and tankers daily. It was a well-built road but badly maintained by the Federal Government who has the responsibility for its upkeep. It is the only direct link of the biggest and busiest port in the country with the hinterland. The damage that has occurred in several areas on the road, took quite a long time to get to its present deplorable state. While the Ore Road which links Edo State, and other States to the East, directly with the commercial capital of the nation was crumbling, a lot of noisy complaints were raised to attract the attention of successive Federal Governments, without any appreciable success. The Apapa situation, without the benefit of such fanfare, could not, of course, be expected to fare better. It may be that, out of sheer humanity, the Lagos State Government might encourage the Federal Government to attend to its responsibility about this road by bringing it to the attention of the Abuja \"overlords\"\u009d. That, actually, is no more than to what the Fashola administration could be expected to commit itself. And it should make it plain to the community, lest the Federal rubbish be swept on to its doorstep. I could hardly believe it when I read it, although I should have expected it. I just felt that with \"transparencies\"\u009d being flashed all over the land, a little change would at least be reflected in our attitude to how we handle the tax-payers' money. I am referring here to the news that it will cost you and me the tidy sum of 45 million naira for the committee investigating the Halliburton scandal to go on junket ostensibly to perform its duty. You will recall that the matter is about a bribe of some 180 million dollars supposed to have been received by some Nigerian officials over a period of about ten years, from 1994. Now in the age of highly sophisticated communications advancement, we are sending this delegation to collect \"evidence\"\u009d all over Europe and the United states. And that after the names of the officials allegedly involved have been released. It is unheard of that very competent officials of government would allow an occasion of squeezing a junket from any exercise to pass muster but, for goodness sake, the excuse for this trip is not even faintly plausible. Why do they think they can fool all the people, all the time? Time out. Related",

        "title": "\u201cNaira is Overvalued\u201d! Says IMF!",
        "author": "Les Leba",
        "text": "By Les Leba The International Monetary Fund (IMF) said on Thursday that the naira was overvalued and that more exchange rate flexibility would be needed to prevent the Central Bank of Nigeria from running down the foreign currency reserves to fix the rate. The Fund said in Washington DC, USA that the CBN might need to increase benchmark interest rates further and weaken its currency to curb inflation, following the increase in public spending\u201d. The above is an excerpt from a news report titled \u201cNaira is Overvalued, IMF Tells CBN\u201d on page 19 of the Punch Newspaper of Friday, 18/2/2011. My reaction to above report was a spontaneous exclamation that \u201cwe are done for!\u201d, as it was clear that rising and increasing consumer prices and higher interest rates consequent upon adoption of IMF\u2019s recommendation will further deepen poverty in Nigeria! There is no doubt about the considerable influence of IMF support and supervision agencies on the operations of our economy, particularly our monetary framework and policies! Indeed, the Fund showed the extent of its commitment to pressing adoption of its prescriptions, when the emoluments of one of its officials, on secondment as our Finance Minister were underwritten in dollars in the recent past. The result of that enterprise, of course, was our gleeful separation from about $20bn of our reserves, in what was affectionately termed as \u2018debt forgiveness\u2019! Meanwhile, rising unemployment, unbridled inflation and reduced industrial capacity with lending rates above 20% prevailed against the realistic expectation of Nigerians, for the goodwill of having our economy managed by IMF technocrats! We were obviously oblivious to the age_old reference to loyalty of the piper to his benefactor when we accepted the \u2018imposition\u2019! Nigerians will recall that the main cause of our economic downturn and increasing abject poverty of the masses can be traced to IMF-sponsored Structural Adjustment Program (SAP), to which then President Babangida acceded. The major thrust of SAP was the devaluation of the naira. IMF held that naira was grossly overvalued, in spite of bourgeoning industrial landscape, increasing job opportunities, and wages and salaries commanding significant purchasing power. The resultant grossly devalued naira quickly induced brain drain, as experienced lecturers, professors, doctors, nurses, engineers and scientists fled to greener pastures, where, in spite of the regret of social dislocation, they were assured of incomes that could maintain their dignity and self-worth. Soon after the exodus, the quality of education at all levels dropped remarkably; today, we are still nowhere near recovery. Rapid naira devaluation sounded the death knell for otherwise prospering commercial and industrial conurbations in the country, as production costs skyrocketed, and cash flow challenges could not be favourably resolved with lending rates above 20%! The unanticipated spiraling cost of critical imports of parts and equipment also dealt injurious blows on the state of social infrastructure as hospitals, power stations, steel complexes and diverse consumer industries were destabilized. The net product became a ghostly industrial landscape, and hundreds of thousands of Nigerians lost their jobs. The continuous, officially sanctioned naira devaluation to its present rate of N152=$1 has finally reduced incomes of over 50% of Nigerians to below United Nation\u2019s poverty benchmark of $2 per day; a grim reality, which has led thousands of young desperate Nigerians to traverse inhospitable deserts and stormy seas in search of a better life. Some critics have likened the migration to the slave trade era, but the difference this time is that, the slaves willingly find their ways to the \u2018camps\u2019 either by hook or crook! The above gives a fair picture of the socially destructive impact of SAP with naira devaluation as its arrowhead. My concern, therefore, at the present IMF call for further naira devaluation, is the sad recognition of the prospect of aggravated poverty, which will inevitably be its product in the light of our historical antecedent. However, some observers may consider such perspective as alarmist and note that the IMF recommendation is without binding force! Even if there is no overt imposition, the reality is that, IMF has generally had its way in \u2018third world\u2019 countries, and our national experiences confirm same. Other analysts may conclude that the IMF report is actually notice of a \u2018done deal\u2019 and sooner than later, naira will be devalued by more than 10%; in other words, naira may exchange for dollar at over N175=$1! Curiously, one of the reasons for IMF\u2019s recommendation for naira devaluation was to halt capital flight or forestall \u2018one-way bets in foreign exchange market\u2019 according to IMF parlance! But regrettably, this overt recommendation for a devalued naira will only spur the already buoyant market for dollar and consequently precipitate the Fund\u2019s prediction of capital flight, which may then make naira devaluation subsequently inevitable! This may appear to some as a case of working to the answer, but unfortunately, such circuitous exchange rate masterminding will work against our economic recovery and do much damage to the demand base of our economy as all income values, particularly those of the poor, whittle under the plague of rising prices! A lower valued naira will make it very difficult if not impossible to remove fuel subsidy and instead earn revenue from a fuel sales tax as in other countries, like the US and UK with crude oil endowments. In place of revenue from a sales tax, we will continue to pay more than the current value of over N500bn as fuel subsidies every year. Yes, the bloated quantum naira sums consequent on devaluation will, no doubt, nominally increase monthly revenue allocations to the three tiers of government, but these bigger naira allocations will command less purchasing value and still present insurmountable challenges for best practice monetary policy management as CBN\u2019s albatross of ever-present scourge of \u2018too much cash or excess liquidity\u2019 will become exacerbated and require increasing public borrowings to remove such excess cash from the market to dampen inflationary spiral. The adoption of such a liquidity control strategy accounts for a large chunk of over N500bn currently paid as interest and service charges for moneys borrowed by CBN in its failed efforts to bring about single digit inflationary rate over the years! To be fair, IMF also recognizes the inflationary threat caused by what it describes as the \u201c\u2026pro-cyclical fiscal stance and an accommodative monetary policy\u201d of the government and thus quickly recommended an antidote of \u2018monetary tightening\u2019 policies; in lay man\u2019s language, this means that current lending rates of 20 \u2013 22% should be induced to rise way above these already investment prohibitive rates, so as to halt the prospect of further inflation! The reality, of course, is that much higher cost of funds coupled with higher industrial replacement costs as a result of naira devaluation will certainly restrain any progress to industrial consolidation or expansion and worsen an already depressed labour market! It should become obvious from the above that there is no window of victory in any sector of Nigeria\u2019s economic and social endeavour that IMF\u2019s recommendations for a lower valued naira and higher cost of borrowing can possibly deliver! It is curious that in spite of its intimidating credentials as the custodian of best Central Banking practices, the IMF fails to see the huge disconnect in the structure of our money market, where, in spite of a CBN benchmark rate of about 6%, deposits attract less than 4% concurrently with lending rates of over 20%! I am baffled that the Fund\u2019s experts do not see anything wrong in the present monetary framework where CBN pays huge naira allocations into the bank accounts of the three tiers of government one day only to return within a few days to borrow much of these moneys back at an average cost of about 10%. Meanwhile, the IMF recognizes that such high interest charges for sovereign debts are inappropriate and yet it makes no recommendations to remedy this anomaly, which saps hundreds of billions of naira every year from government revenue with adverse impact on the amount available for infrastructural enhancement! This is a very high cost to pay for the joy of removing presumed \u2018excess cash\u2019 from the system for warehousing in CBN vaults and accounting records in failed attempts to subdue the rage of inflation! The paradox, of course, is that this liquidity mop up and monetary tightening occurs side by side with CBN\u2019s acknowledgement that banks are cash-strapped and have to be pampered with ample cash injections to heal their wounds, before they can perform their role as the strong backbone of a resilient and prosperous economy. We have doggedly and faithfully followed this cycle in spite of glaring evidence of its failure to jumpstart the economy and the obvious deepening poverty over the years. Whether or not the IMF can be excused for not recognising these glaring contradictions in the operation of Nigeria\u2019s monetary policy is another matter, but the Fund\u2019s comment in the Bloomberg report under reference that \u201cNigeria has weathered the global economic recession and its own domestic banking crisis reasonably well\u201d may suggest either mischief or innocent ignorance of the Nigerian economy. Objective analysts will insist that Nigeria\u2019s economy has remained in the doldrums since the mid 1980s, during which period, unemployment has continued to soar unabated, such that unemployment rates always significantly exceeded the rate in those countries, which were victims and villains of the global recession! The same can be said for the rate of inflation and the level of interest rates! If truth must be told, global recession was not the primary causative factor for the economic wilderness which Nigeria finds itself! We have ceaselessly argued in this column that the real poison in the matrix of fiscal and monetary policy management in Nigeria is CBN\u2019s substitution of bloated naira sums for dollar component of monthly distributable revenue! It is inexplicable that IMF does not recognize this pungent reality, and the Fund\u2019s recommendation for an even \u201cgreater exchange rate flexibility to forestall the depletion of our foreign reserves\u201d is even more perplexing! How much more liberal can you get after the unforced error of CBN\u2019s monthly allocations of billions of otherwise scarce dollar reserves directly to Bureau de Change for onward sales to looters of the treasury, sponsors of capital flight and smugglers of contraband goods? It is baffling that the IMF fails to see anything wrong in this practice, or indeed, to identify such dollar allocations as a major contributor to depletion of our foreign reserves. Questions can be raised on whether or not IMF\u2019s unsolicited advices are truly altruistic or are discrete and convoluted strategies to separate us from our wealth with the same inconsequential rewards of a poorly negotiated partnership agreement similar to the slave trade era. \u2022Save The Naira, Save Nigerians!

        "author": "Ochereome Nnanna",
        "text": "By Ochereome Nnanna I WATCHED the Northern political summit of Thursday, July 15, 2010 , which took place in Kaduna with keen interest. I was not surprised or disappointed with the outcome, which virtually endorsed President Goodluck Jonathan's perceived presidential ambition. Northern governors will soon meet to take a stand on the zoning controversy. My prediction is that they will continue to dilly-dally till the \"last minute\"\u009d, and finally, the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) governors will throw their weight behind the President. Listening to those who spoke at the summit, I noticed that most of them were actually positioning for relevance in a Goodluck Jonathan dispensation. Of all the speech makers of that day, it was only the lady (Hajiya Maryam Waziri, if I get her name correctly) that made an intelligent, short, straight-to-the-point and real issues-based speech. The others merely jostled for positions or \"front seats\"\u009d when the over 8,000 federal political jobs are shared out after the elections of 2011. The lady made it clear that when the so-called \"gentleman's agreement\"\u009d of zoning was being concocted, Northern women were not consulted. This exposes yet another weak link in the North's chain of armour. Governor Sule Lamido once lamented that Northern men dominate their women to the point of dehumanisation of a majority of them. He decided to liberate Jigawa girl-children by giving them free and compulsory education to tertiary level. A smaller minority of Northern Muslim women, such as Senator Najatu Mohammed, have become radicalised and seize every forum to dismiss the Northern political elite as self-seekers. The concept of \"Northern unity\"\u009d exists only on paper these days. The violent history of cohabitation between the ethnic and religious majorities and their minority counterparts, a trait that is peculiar only to the North, belies the pretences of \"Northern unity\"\u009d. However, it has to be admitted here that Islam has continued to be a strong binding force for the adherents of the faith in the North because there is little difference between the Muslim from Idah in Southern Kogi and the Muslim from Bida in Niger State and the Muslim from Maiduguri in Borno State and the Muslim from Gusau in Zamfara State. But the ability of this religious culture to translate into a common political interest is waning. The Sardauna of Sokoto, Alhaji Ahmadu Bello's political movement laboured very hard to build a united North. Those who came immediately after them also did their best to consolidate on this legacy, but the internal contradictions of the North (ethnic and religious differences which periodically presented in bloody conflicts) gradually unsettled the prospects of Northern unity. By far the greatest weapon against the North's ability to re-assert its collective political weight is traced to the growing dependency of its elite on the state for their minimal comfort. The Northern elite have traditionally depended on government, especially the Federal Government. That is their primary reason for insisting on power staying in the North. This dependency syndrome (which some have called \"parasitism\"\u009d), unfortunately, is a habit that has spread to the elites of every section of the country. Everybody who is anybody in this country is struggling to have access to the government of the day, particularly the Presidency. In this jostling for relevance, regional gang-ups cannot hold against the political ambition of the current occupant of Aso Villa. Just look at it: President Goodluck Jonathan has not even said a word about his plans for the presidency in 2011 and yet those seeking to replace him through the zoning arrangement have already lost the battle. The Northern elite have never been in the opposition. They are not going to start now. They know what it means to be shut out of reckoning. Gradually, the pro-zoning agitation will wither away. Those hoping to capitalise on the platform of zoning and \"Northern unity\"\u009d to run for president will receive the shock of their lives soon. I said it before, and I say it again that Nigeria is changing, but there are many who are still living in the past. \"Northern unity\"\u009d is no longer desirable, and has never been.\u00c2 Neither is \"Southern unity\"\u009d for that matter. A united North against a united South is a recipe for national disintegration. Similarly, a united North against a splintered South is a formula for the enslavement of the South and the masses of the North by a small cabal of Northern oligarchs. Colonialism and the civil war were the fuels that fired the engine of that oligarchy. The fuel has burnt out. And the \"unity\"\u009d it forged among the beneficiaries of that oligarchical dispensation has collapsed. The North no longer calls the shots when it comes to the issue of who should be the president of Nigeria . It is Aso Villa that decides, and everyone lines up behind its decision. The dependency syndrome of the elite is responsible for that. Former President Olusegun Obasanjo chose his successor. In the same manner, President Jonathan will pick his successor. If his choice happens to be Dr Goodluck Ebele Azikiwe Jonathan, so will it be. I hereby join Hajiya Waziri in calling on Nigerians to look for good quality persons to entrust with the leadership of this country. Let us look for the man or woman who will repair our economy and democracy, create jobs, give us electricity, rehabilitate our educational system and improve our infrastructure. Let us emulate Ghana and South Africa , where the tribal or regional background of the presidents were never the factors behind their election. It was not \"Zulu unity\"\u009d that propelled Jacob Zuma to be president of South Africa ; neither was it \"Ewe unity\"\u009d that made Jerry Rawlings the \"Junior Jesus\"\u009d of Ghana . Tribal, religious and regional politicians of Nigeria wake up. It is a new day! Related",

        "text": "By Paul Bassey Big Brother: Your Excellency, Big Brother has noticed the dwindling fortunes of Nigerian sports and Big Brother wants to find out your opinion on this. Gov Fashola: Big Brother, I am aware, but it is not as bad as some of us portray it. Big Brother: Gov what gives you this hope? Gov Fashola: You cannot divorce sports from the general malaise of this country. It is a systemic problem, one that I believe will go away if we\u00c2 w Big Brother: Gov, how do we work at it?ork at it. Gov Fashola: We must first identify sports for what it is, its values and prospects as an instrument of unity and youth development. Big Brother: Can the governor be specific. Gov Fashola: If we place sports in its proper perspective we will be able to now work at its positive traits and\"\u00a6\"\u00a6 Big Brother: Your Excellency imagine you are addressing a town hall meeting. Bring yourself down to our level so that we can best appreciate your view points. Gov Fashola: That is what I am trying to do\"\u00a6. Big Brother: Big brother believes you are not trying hard enough\"\u00a6\"\u00a6 Gov Fashola: My argument is simple, that if the government appreciates the importance of sports, then it will enhance its interest, involvement and promotion. Big Brother: Why has it taken government so long to,\u00c2 as you say,\u00c2 \"appreciate the importance of sports\"\u009d? Gov Fashola: Big Brother don't you think the Sports Minister is the proper person to bring into the diary room? He is better positioned and constitutionally empowered to handle this issue\"\u00a6. Big Brother: I expected this question much earlier. The Sports Minister's session will come. For now, there are a lot of Nigerians who believe you are doing so much for sports that if you were saddled with certain responsibilities, sports will be better for it in this country. Gov Fashola: What we have tried to do in our little corner has to do with the development of the game in our state. Don't forget that we are still far off from the Lagos glory of yore. As far as sports is concerned, Lagos used to be number one, not any more, that is why we are working relentlessly to restore Lagos to that enviable height. Big Brother: The championing of the Okwaraji case was not a state\u00c2 matter. Also your involvement in the burial of coach Tella was not a state matter. What about the assistance you have rendered to national teams in the area of camping and the like\"\u00a6? Gov Fashola: We are saying the same thing. Those are isolated cases\"\u00a6. Big Brother: Big Brother is aware that you have contracted the former president of the Athletics Federation of Nigeria, Engineer Adeyemi Wilson, to help revive track and field in your state. Any dividends so far? Gov Fashola: What we are doing with track and field we are also doing with other sports. We are not expecting results in a hurry. We are trying to lay veritable foundations for the development of sports and no better place to do this than the schools and at the grassroots. Big Brother: Today you are doing this as Gov Fashola. What structures are you putting in place to ensure that these plans outlive you? Gov Fashola: Let us not lose sight of the fact that a senior member of my cabinet is in charge of sports. Also we have brought on board technocrats and professionals, even those who are not indigenes. With them driving the sports project, it is no more a personal thing but a collective responsibility. Big Brother: Big Brother is interested in training the trainers. Does His Excellency think that exposing coaches to the type of tasks we undertake in Big Brother House could help bring out the best candidates? Gov Fashola: If Big Brother is insinuating that a lot of under the table dealings are involved in the selection of our coaches, he will not be too far from the truth, but it is not a universal occurrence. Big Brother: What is your view of the MRI scan that has rocked the nation's Under- 17 team? Gov Fashola: It will end up being a blessing in disguise. Let us not look at it as a Nigerian thing. This is a FIFA breakthrough that will end up revolutionizing the development of youth football. Here we have always regretted the non graduation of our players from their superlative junior displays to the senior cadre. By the time the MRI scan comes to stay, we will be able to produce players in their proper age category who will end up playing for the country for a long time yet. Big Brother: I am sure you have something to say on the Super Eagles and what is believed to be a poor World Cup run Gov Fashola: There is no doubt that we are walking a tightrope, but I remain optimistic. That, is the beauty of football, a sport where a winner does not always emerge till the last blast of the referee\u2019s whistle. Ask Manchester City. Big Brother: Ahaaaa..that reminds me,\u00c2 you are a Man U supporter. How do you react to those who believe, it is unpatriotic to support foreign teams and leagues to the detriment of the domestic game? Gov Fashola: Very soon we will be told to patronize canoes and not to enter planes because these are made by foreigners. It took the Europeans and others a lot of years to evolve to this level. We are free to use them as reference points to chart our course and focus on where we think we want to get to. For me, that I support Man U or Barcelona does not stop me from remembering that Stationery Stores was a great club in this state that needs to be revived. Big Brother: Thank you Gov Fashola. Is there anything you want to tell Big Brother? Gov Fashola: Not really, except that we are a blessed country with so much potential that if well harnessed, not even the sky will be a limit for our youth. Big Brother: Okay. Big Brother appreciates. Thanks for your time. Please close the door behind you. ( Governor Fashola in Big Brother House? This is malaria induced dream.) Keeping NPL out of this\"\u00a6\"\u00a6. Last week we carried a rejoinder by Mr. Ade Ojeikere, sports editor of the Nation newspapers, who argued that the Nigeria Professional League (NPL) should not be credited with the successes recorded by Pillars and Heartland in Africa. Others have joined the battle as it were and we reproduce here\u00c2 the mails we got on this issue, all of them ironically, not sharing his viewpoint. David Danisa says . . . Mr. Ade Ojeikere may be 49 years old, but seem in want of decorum that comes with maturity, lucidity of thought that comes with understanding and the finesse in conduct and utterance that is expected of a thinking man. Can it be that Mr. Ojeikere is unaware that his remark on Sudanese women degrades womanhood? Could he not tell that the people of the Republic of Sudan and their culture would be injured by his frivolous, unsolicited and infantile remark? Is he still oblivious to the fact that he disrespected numerous readers of Vanguard Newspapers with such an utterly uncalled for remark? Was it at all necessary for Mr. Ojeikere to rhetorically inquire of Mr. Bassey, details of the supposedly (promiscuous, flimsy and silly) \"Sudanese women\"\u009d part of his story? Should that comment even have thought about, written, or published? If Mr. Ojeikere and his likes, constitute a visible section of people shaping public opinion in Nigeria (i.e., an essential section of the Nigerian elite class), then we are all in trouble. When the salt of earth loses it taste, what then becomes of the world? David Danisa \"\u00a6..What is he talking about? Oga Paul, since Ojeikere quit NPL, he hasn't seen anything good of that body. The same Ojeikere who never saw anything good in the NFF,\u00c2 is now their mouthpiece. Why is he comparing Nigeria where things are always done the opposite way with England? Is the Nation where he works run professionally like any English Newspaper? I think the NFF should face the Eagles and 2010 and leave Pillars and Heartland alone. Pat Omorodion 08052201960 I pity Ade I want to believe that I can guess what Ade is trying to say but he is not saying it. I do not want to believe he can come out to deny the NPL all the merited glory for what our league has now become. Chuks 'fineboy\"\u009d Igwe 08025848780 No, Ade No! I believe I know a bit about the transformation of the league from the NFF to the NFL and later the NPL. Can Mr. Ojeikere,\u00c2 in all sincerity,\u00c2 compare the paltry sum that the NFA launched the league with and what Chief Obaseki and his lieutenants have achieved so far? I am forced to believe that there is more to Mr. Ojeikere's attack than what we have been made to believe. Never in the history of this country have we had it so well, pushing two teams into the semi-final of the CAF Champions league. Especially the surprise ouster of Al Ahly of Egypt by Kano Pillars who have gone ahead to prove that the victory was no fluke. Mr. Ojeikere should channel his belly aching elsewhere. Ntiense Imaikop, 4 Udo Udoma Avenue Uyo He contradicts himself Is this not the same Ojeikere who was a member of the league pioneer body? Is he not the same one in the board of relegated Bendel insurance? Does he not know that clubs are limited liabilities and there is a limit to NPL's involvement in their day to day running? I believe he knows our limitations here and for NPL to have risen above those limitations to create a record in Africa is worthy of commendation. Adebayor Oluyemisi Fine writer, but\"\u00a6. Here is one of my finest writers on contemporary sports issues. But this time around, he goofed. NFF? Abeg Jonathan Vembeh,jovem@yahoo.co.ukk Funny side of life I plead guilty. That I ended last week's piece without the traditional funny side of life is regretted. This week we go to Warri where Zamfara United is five goals down to Warri Wolves with only a minute to the end of the match. It is reported that a Zamfara defender turned to his goalkeeper and said \"old boy, I have a feeling we will lose this match.\"\u009d See you next week. Related",

        "author": "Owei Lakemfa",
        "text": "By Owei Lakemfa THE Father of the Nation, former President Olusegun Aremu Obasanjo is livid. He is angry because some children of the nation accused him of imposing a chronically ill man, President Umaru Yar'Adua\u00c2 on the country. Like other fathers of their nations such as \"Papa Doc\"\u009d Duvalier of Haiti and \"Papa\"\u009d Hastings Kamuzu Banda of Malawi who assumed that their fellow citizens are children who cannot make rational choices, including voting for a president, \"Baba\"\u009d Obasanjo had subverted the democratic process by hand- picking and imposing Yar'Adua as President. Having bottled up his anger for so long, he exploded publicly on January 22, 2010 at the 7th\u00c2 Annual Daily Trust Lecture where he responded to insults that he imposed an \"invalid\"\u009d on the country as president. Obasanjo claimed that having decided to make Yar'Adua his successor, his appointee presented him with a certificate of fitness indicating that he had been cured of his chronic kidney problems. What Obasanjo did not tell the nation was whether as president and Commander-in-Chief of the country's resources and given his acclaimed statesmanship and experience, he authenticated Yar'Adua's claim. Obviously he did not because Yar'Adua's illness at the time was an open secret which might be why he did not present himself as an aspirant until Obasanjo ordained him the next president. It is also a known fact that the rest of the PDP presidential aspirants did not initially factor Yar'Adua into their campaign strategies because Nigerians, with the possible exception of Obasanjo, knew that he was a chronically sick\u00c2 person. So, if Obasanjo now cries that Yar'Adua deceived him, that, as we say in these parts, \"is his own funeral\"\u009d. But I doubt that Obasanjo was deceived because he did most of Yar'Adua's campaigns when the latter was too sick. At a point in the campaigns when Yar'Adua was again flown abroad for urgent medical treatment and there were rumours that he might have died, Obasanjo at a public rally, theatrically called his anointed, put him on speaker phone and asked: \"Umoru are you dead?\"\u009d That was his way of dispelling rumours that Yar'Adua was too sick to govern; to him the rest of us were liars. Today he publicly acknowledges that we were not; indeed if there were any lies peddled about Yar'Adua's health, it was by Obasanjo and his team. But we need to leave matters at that because Obasanjo who was choir master and pastor at the Aso Rock Villa church and recently read theology at the Open University, has proclaimed before the nation that if he knew that Yar'Adua was still sick before imposing him, \"God will punish me\"\u009d. I say Amen! to his prayers. Baba also claimed that in appointing Yar'Adua as the 'elected' president, he considered three important qualities: \" One, enough intellectual capacities to run the affairs of Nigeria; two, sufficient personal integrity to run the affairs of the country and three, sufficient broad-mindedness\"\u009d. Three years into the Yar'Adua presidency, there are no indications that it has the intellectual capacity to run the country. Secondly, it lacks the broad-mindedness to be even-handed or even to accept that in the absence of the President-as Yar'Adua has been absent for over two months- the Vice President should act. The third quality is perhaps a joke: How could the Obasanjo administration talk about \"integrity\"\u009d when it had numerous international bribery charges hanging\u00c2 round its neck? How could an administration that allegedly looted the country's resources, from the Petroleum Technology Development Fund to the proceeds of privatisation and sale of government houses claim integrity? How can Obasanjo talk about integrity when TRANSCORP, a non transparent company he helped to set up and in which he owned shares, under his watch, fraudulently bought government-owned companies like NITEL only to strip them of their assets? The country had 3,000mw of electricity when Obasanjo came to power. After eight years of imperial presidency and $16 billion down the drain, the regime left the country with 1,800mw; is that a government of\u00c2 integrity? It is an open secret that choice lands in Abuja and public houses in Lagos and Abuja were shared by the leading lights of that regime and their families, including Obasanjo who personally took the Universal Basic Education lands in the country's capital. Were we not the unwilling audience of the comic plays by Obasanjo image launderers like Femi Fani-Kayode\u00c2 who sought to explain his sudden wealth by claiming that the Obasanjo Farms in Ota was minting N30 million profit daily? When asked how much tax the farm was paying if indeed it made so much profit daily, the acts collapsed and the theatre was closed. In any case, Obasanjo's acclaimed arrow head in the Yar'Adua deal, El-Rufai has admitted publicly\u00c2 that Yar'Adua was actually one of the governors on the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) corruption list but that with his anointment by Obasanjo as Presidet-in- waiting, the then anti-corruption Czar, Nuhu Ribadu was ordered to take him off the list so that he can be presented as a man of 'integrity'. But can there be any lack of integrity, or any form of corruption greater than the brazen rigging of the 2003 and 2007 elections by the Obasanjo regime? It was so pervasive that even party primaries were rigged. There were the cases of Rotimi Amaechi and Ifeanyi Araraume in Rivers and Imo states. The rerun gubernatorial elections in states like Adamawa, Kogi, Sokoto, Cross River, Ekiti and Bayelsa, and the judicial reversals in Edo and Ondo states were all due to the corruption of the electoral process by the Obasanjo gang. So what integrity is he talking about ? Related",

        "text": "It\u2019s a new year. Welcome to 2012. While exchanging compliments of the season with the General Secretary of the NFF we thought it wise to pray for a year that should make us forget the night mare that was 2011. That is why one of my favorite wishes for the new year came from my friend Ibn Mohammed, who prayed for positive inputs from all of us, towards the betterment of our sports especially football in the coming year. I do not think I want to bore my readers today repeating the disaster that was the year just gone by. I prefer instead to look ahead, to the future. If I could, I would have talked about the London Olympics and our chances because that is the question my younger colleagues inundate me with. Seven months away, I regret not having much to say. Incidentally instead of us coming together to tackle the problem, all I get to read from the media are stories of association chairmen and presidents passing the buck. Translated directly it reads like this \u201c \u2026\u2026if we go to the Olympics and fail, do not hold us responsible because we are yet to get money from the National Sports Commission\u201d Pray, when are we going to get associations that will operate independent of government? When are we going to get men and women who can muster enough funds to run their sports while not waiting for, or pending when government makes the fund available? I remember that the NFF did complain that the NSC did not make funds available for her Olympics and All Africa Games Qualifiers, yet it went ahead to play those matches, pending. Three weeks ago in this column, I spoke about a young man who organized Copa Lagos Beach Soccer independently and made a success out of it. Worse, the NSC is now involved in all manners of summons from the law makers that may even leave it with not enough time to plan for the Olympics. The future of our sports is Stephen Keshi and the domestic players, holed up in Abuja, players and officials who sacrificed Christmas and the attendant end of year festivities to be able to lay a foundation for the future of our football. This has always been the thinking of the Technical Committee of the Nigeria Football Federation. I remember that when Siasia came on board we canvassed this line of action which he bought, called some players to camp but later on abandoned the idea for an ephemeral disposition that emphasised victory at all cost to the detriment of the development of the sport. Keshi is determined to go steps further. He has decided to be patient with the boys and has psyched them up with the declaration that should they work hard,not less than eight of them will be in his squad against Rwanda in February. Then came the part that attracted expected reactions. That he will not tolerate earrings and \u2018Nyanga\u2019 football.The first shot was fired by my pastor. Pastor Elijah Okon Usen is the Area Superintendent of The Apostolic Church Maboju. \u201c \u2026..If not for anything, for that singular decision Keshi will succeed. From now on I will double my prayers for him. Discipline is about men not getting distracted by feminine and wordly apparels\u201d Pastor Usen emphasized during a Sunday sermon. Those who thought the coach should not impinge on the fundamental rights ( ? ) of players would have lost sleep when Obafemi Martins came out to say that he will readily pull off his earrings to play for Keshi. That for me is the spirit, one in which I want Keshi to embrace. The news that he will play Rwanda with at least eight domestic league players is already sending shivers down the spines of the foreign armada, those players who in the past believed that their only passport to the national team was being a member of a European club. Whether they were regulars or bench warmers did not matter. Just recently my friend Ini Edoho, ( Amama ) a player\u2019s agent returned from India with tales of three players he believed can walk into the national team if given the chance. Edoho should know. Being a team manager for clubs like Nitel, Akwa United and Enyimba confers on him some authority in technicalities of the game. I do not mind the situation where players are given the chance to prove themselves no matter where they ply their wares. That is why Youth Corper Morah who has no club to call his own is part of my daily prayers, for him to break through, on merit of course, quite aware that there are more like him. All Keshi needs is patience and time to build a brand new team for Nigeria. We will not forget that it was when Keshi and co were not readily available that Westerhoff from scratch, built a team of local stars into superstars. Not only does Keshi require time, he has to start on a clean slate, not tied down by the prejudices of the past. Next time there is a meeting of the Technical Committee, called to share with Keshi on his list for the Rwanda and other matches, I will go armed with a dossier celebrating the current form of Odemnwigie, Anichebe and Victor Moses. I will ask for permission to address members on why Yakubu Aiyegbeni should be number one on that list. Welcome to 2012, the year of Redemption. Related",

        "author": "Paul Bassey",
        "text": "By Paul Bassey I am at the Khartoum International Stadium. The time is 19.05 Sudanese time, 17.05 Nigerian time. The first quarter final match of the ongoing 2nd Orange African Nations Championship has just come to an end and with it the impressive run of an experimental South African side that defied form books to top a group that included Ghana , Niger and Zimbabwe . On the night, South Africa was a sorry side, emphatically beaten 2_0, different from the bunch that won all its three matches, scored six goals and conceded only two. Though a lot of people believe the penalty awarded Algeria for their goal was soft, there was no disputing the superior side as the Algerians were in complete control of the match. As I am writing this Sudan is set to take on another surprise team, Niger . The NFF President has said here that Niger needed to advance this far for them to lay claim to a worthy victory over Nigeria . On Saturday it was the turn of Tunisia and T.P. Mazembe dominated Congo DR , while Angola had Group C leaders Cameroun for foe. In other words, as you are reading this there are only four teams remaining in the competition from the 16 that started the tournament over two weeks ago. Since I was not privileged to know the four before filing in this report, and since I cannot claim to have the gift of clairvoyancy, all I can say is that we are likely to have a worthy winner after a very keenly contested tournament that defied the form books all the way. I have stopped talking about Nigeria\u2019s participation in the tournament, but as a colleague remarked the other day we should not get used to Africa doing without us in Continental competitions. That I, Linus Mba and referee Edibe Peter are flying Nigeria \u2019s flag here does not seem to be enough consolation. Edibe before I forget is doing very well here. I did a match with him in Port Sudan , and on Sunday he was on the lines in my quarter final match involving Tunisia and R.D. Congo. I pray he goes on to feature in the final or at worst in the third place match which will be held same day with the final on February 25 at El Merreikh. I quickly remind that though we were not in Rwanda for the U_17 and are not here for CHAN we will be in Libya for the U_20. NFF president Maigari believes Coach Obuh has a killer squad capable of coming home with the trophy that is why we pray that the current unrest blowing through Benghazi and Tripoli will respect the universal language of football and allow CAF to move in and organize the trophy. Twice I have made mention of the NFF President. Yes he is here. Last Thursday, the honourable minister of sports hit town with President Maigari, Alhaji Galadima and Alhaji Abba Yola. Last Friday the minister had very fruitful discussions with the CAF President Issa Hayatou on the way forward for Nigerian Football which a lot of people agree is facing very hard times. Yes the CAF elections were discussed and frankly too which afforded Nigeria the opportunity of charting a course of action different from the original plan. Let it be said that the politics of football has not changed. It is as exciting and as interesting as the game itself and winners do not emerge till the final whistle has been blown. In two days CAF will go to the polls and Nigeria expects to be able to sustain the momentum maintained by Dr. Adamu. Will it be easy? My answer is an emphatic NO. First of all we need to appreciate the actors and the scenario that is being played out here. The first is that Since Dr Adamu is insisting on clearing his name by going to CAS, then his CAF Executive Committee position is not vacant., going by the CAF Statutes that empowers the executive to declare the position vacant and fill same, not by election. So until CAS hears the case, it is a no go area. Don\u2019t ask me when CAS is going to hear the case. The second is that with the FIFA Position a hot cake, the candidature of Alhaji Galadima will need some work to scale through. When I say work, I mean a whole lot of work. For instance, the FIFA Position is being contested by three members of the CAF Executive Committee, Mohammed Rouaroua of Algeria ,Suketu Patel of Seychelles and Jacques Anouma of Cote D\u2019Ivoire . Add to this Kalusha Bwalya of Zambia and the World Cup made famous Danny Jordan and you will understand why we are going in there as under dogs. But as earlier said\u2026..down to work\u2026\u2026so help us God. Some update. Almamy Kabele Kabele returns to the Executive unopposed, Congo \u2019s Constant Omari is also unopposed from Central Africa while the Zone West B battle will be tough with five candidates, Moucharaf Anjorin of Benin remains the front runner. Also look out for another titanic battle in COSAFA that has pitched together Danny Jordan, Walter Nyambilanmu of Malawi , Kalusha Bwalya of Zambia , John Muinjoh of Namibia and Justinho Mendez of Angola . All this work work and more work has not allowed me the opportunity of telling you about my lunch by the Red Sea and the special post lunch Ethiopian woman\u2019s tea that is accompanied by special fumes capable of driving away bad spirit and bringing\u2026\u2026the holy spirit. See you next week. Related",

        "text": "By Paul Bassey I regret not signing off properly last year. Do I care? The most important is that here we are in the magical year 2010. By the grace of the Almighty we are alive to start another journey of providence to sports heaven(?) I graciously seize this opportunity to thank family, friends and readers of this column for very touching wishes as expressed through text messages and mails. Some of those messages were so ingenious I wish I could reproduce them here. Maybe I will, someday. The sport year 2009 was as memorable as it was challenging. Internationally, it was the year of Barcelona, of Lionel Messi, of Kim Clitjers, of Roger Federer, of Cristiano Ronaldo. The year 2009 was the year of a certain Usain Bolt, shooting out from the blues and taking the world of track and field by storm. That was the year South Africa put up an incredible football World Cup draw in Durban that silenced those still in the opposition as to the organizational prowess of the Africans. I will remember 2009 as the year the great Tiger Woods fell from grace to grass (One of my friends has been insistent in asking WETIN HE DO ?) in like vein, 2009 is also the year Andre Agassi woke up and decided to taint an impeccable tennis record with a confession that he doped (This oyibo sef ). Brazil can claim 2009 as its greatest sports year ever outside its five World Cup triumphs. Imagine winning the bid to host the FIFA World Cup in 2014 and topping that with an unprecedented IOC vote as the next host of the Olympic Games after London! It was in the year 2009 that Ghana made the Black Continent proud by historically winning the FIFA Junior World Cup. If you think I am trying to run away from Nigeria you are mistaken. In 2009, Nigeria emerged the champion of\u00c2 African Beach Soccer World Cup elimination. In 2009, Engineer Habu Gumel restored Nigeria's pride at Olympic level when he was elected into the most prestigious sports board on earth, that of the International Olympic Committee, ( IOC ) . Nigeria had three teams to the league stage of CAF Club cups, a feat no African country was able to achieve. The three clubs got to the semi-final stage and one of them had to lose in the final of the Champions League. Alas! The Vuvuzela made a very bold entry into the sports history of the world when it drove players and officials crazy, yet FIFA could do nothing about it. For me this was a victory of sorts in a country where supportership is limited to a band of green and white clad, Globacom sponsored individuals whose songs the crowd are not involved in. Take Vuvuzela to Anfield and see how it will struggle to compete against 50,000 spectators whose voices are raised in unison to sing \u201cYou will not walk alone\u201d. I will also remember 2009 as the year Dr. Amos Adamu made good his election promises by resurrecting WAFU through the staging of competitions. Africa Independent Television (AIT ) should stand up and be recognised for instituting a credible soccer awards that spells hope for stakeholders of the sport. Of all these, the greatest achievement in the sports history of this country in the year just gone by was the qualification of the Super Eagles for South Africa 2010 World Cup. NFF President Lulu and his board, Coach Amodu Shaibu and his crew must all have heaved a sigh of relief as they survived the heat of the football crazy people of this country. I do not care how they did it, I close my ears to the stories behind our qualification, what is key for me is that they qualified and deserve kudos for it, because if they did not\"\u00a6\"\u00a6\"\u00a6.? I agree that 2009 was not only about the positives. I should be able to cite some contrary cases, maybe take them at federation level. Track and field: A popular Chief Solomon Ogba beat a serving governor at the polls and hit the ground running. Went into some satellite competitions and ended up at the World Championship in Berlin where reality hit him hard as Nigeria recorded her worst outing in history given the spate of doping scandals that accompanied our poor showing. Boxing: Since he became president I have not seen or talked to my friend George Taylor. In the midst of an unparalleled cash crunch, I heard he sponsored some boxers to Italy, saw them beaten black and blue, brought them back in wheelchairs their heads bowed, bloodied, bandaged in defeat. Basketball: At the Oliver Tambo airport in South African, I ran into our girls who had sneaked out for a continental competition and came back trophyless. I met a bitter president who bemoaned lack of funds and wished for a better deal. Since then the eloquent Tijani Umar has functioned more on the pages of newspapers \"\u00a6\"\u00a6.. Tennis: Shhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh. Tennis can wait, the Honourable Minister is busy. Which other sports do we have?\u2026.. Plenty? Which plenty?\u2026.2010 will be the year of REALITY. There will be no place to hide. For those federation chairmen who thought that the best thing to happen to them was to fly into Abuja and attend meetings plotting to install the minister as NOC president, good luck to them in 2010. For the NFF, reality even comes sooner than expected as the Nation's Cup kicks off in a few hours. The Nigerian press has been busy celebrating injuries to key Egyptian stars Aboutrika and Amir Zaki. For me the emphatic elimination of those players is a more positive tendency than our situation where injured players are listed with the hope that they will recover in time for the cup. 2010 is the year of the World Cup. Whereas qualified countries are playing friendly matches and have lined up others we do not seem to be bothered. This is the year of the Commonwealth Games. Pray can any one tell me what we have done so far by way of preparations? What are the sports that we will present? Who are the stars so targeted to make us proud? Exposure to the cable TV station Super Sports brings sad memories of a country that is dead sports wise. Through Supersports I get to see how the South Africans are forever playing and organising cricket, rugby, boxing, tennis, football, golf, cycling, motor sport\"\u00a6..establishing foundations and strengthening academies. I am talking about a fellow African country, one that has crowned its track record with a nod to host the prestigious FIFA World Cup among other World Cups. Are we still looking for tools to re-brand this country? The cross over fever is over. We are in 2010. The year of reality, the year that will provide no hiding place for pretenders. Abeg, let no one spoil my year. Happy survival. See you in Angola. Related",

        "text": "By Paul Bassey The Kenya Airways flight that took me to Kinshasha en route Nairobi also had on board, Alhassan Yakmut, Deputy Director in the National Sports Commission, part of a Nigerian team to Maputo, for a pre All Africa Games meeting. The moment I saw them, I remembered writing in my last column that it is only when competitions come round that our drowning sports surface, gasping for life. Outside the Commonwealth, Olympics and other world and continental championships, you never get to hear about the activities of our sports associations, especially those development plans and activities aimed at discovering talents and nurturing them for the future. Kenya Airways did not disappoint. ( I believe, in the absence of our usual money spinning chartered flight, the Nigerian contingent is most likely to fly them to Maputo ) Their current in flight magazine Msafiri ( which you can take away ) had a very interesting feature on the All Africa Games with Olusoji Fasugba on the cover. \u2026 \u201cThe legendary sprinter, 27, has already won two gold medals in a row at the All Africa Games 100m. Can he complete a hat trick?\u201d the magazine asked. Who? Fasugba? Where is he? Just before leaving Nigeria, I was discussing with Danusa Ocholi, Editor of the top soccer magazine Four Four Two Nigeria and how he feels happy that the Nigeria Football Association is getting to honour Muda Lawal by inviting two of his children to be special guests of honour when Nigeria faces Ghana in London. Ocholi added that he wished there was something a bit more concrete than that, citing other footballers ( Okwaraji ) who died serving fatherland and are yet to be immortalized. Just last week, the President of the Sports Veterans Association, Nigeria Jonathan Ogunfere drew my attention to the death of Chief Patrick Bokolor, a man who was involved in the formation of Warri Wolves. How many of us knew that? What about the present managers of Warri Wolves, are they in the position of writing the history of their club? I am sure if my friend Pinnick Amaju was aware of the existence of Chief Bokolor, he would have made it a duty to not only invite but drive him to all their home matches. Living legends Must we wait for them to die before we honour them? Can the NFF not invite living legends of the game in Nigeria to watch football matches? Last week, I extended my congratulations to Chief John Ojidoh who has just clocked 85. A young reader of my column sent a text : \u201c Oga Paul, who is he? Good question, very good question. Right now, I am thinking seriously about doing a weekly column on our sports heroes, veterans, those who are still alive to tell their story. Chief Ojidoh can best be remembered as that games master at Abudu Teachers Training College who formed the great Abudu Rovers Football Club that went as far as the semi final of the Challenge Cup in 1966, losing narrowly 0-1 in controversial circumstances to Plateau United and denied the opportunity of starring in the final. Six years before then he was already a grade one referee and handled the whistle for 19 years. A Zonal Assistant Director of Sports, In 1968 he was voted the best all round coach in the western region, as athletics was also his specialty. Retired as a vice principal and was appointed Chairman of the Bendel State Football Association by then military governor General Innih and he chaired for nine years During his tenure, Bendel State had four teams in the 12 team Nigeria professional league and this included Bendel Insurance, New Nigeria Bank, NNPC and Flash Flamingoes. This, is just in brief. I can go on and on. Is he alone, what about former Team Manager of the Green Eagles Peter Osugo? Veteran referees Linus Mba, Sunny Badru and Festus Okubule, forgotten former secretary general of the NFA Herbert Omokhaye, NFA board members Bisi Lawrence, Prince Oduah, legendary athlete Amelia Okpalaoka, tennis sensation Demola Ali alias Fireman\u2026\u2026..the list is endless. These are the ones I see at least once a month, and talk to, regularly. How grateful I am to them for the endless wealth of knowledge I tap from them. The Kenya Airways in flight magazine went on to inform that Nigeria will be very strong in the weight lifting event\u2026 \u201c The Nigerians are serious competitors in the weightlifting event, having won five gold at the Commonwealth Games. Look out for Augustina Nkem Nwaokolo in the women\u2019s 48kg, Hadiza Zakari in the women\u2019s 75kg and Yakubu Adesokan in the men\u2019s bench press\u201d\u2026really? Very interesting. Meanwhile the only thing I get to read in the papers is how Siasia has invited Osaze at last for a FRIENDLY against Ghana, whereas a foreign magazine is telling me that less than a month away, there are certain Nigerian women likely to win gold for Nigeria! Last time out in Algeria we placed a distant fourth with 50 gold behind Egypt (74), Algeria (70) and South Africa 61. What hope Maputo? Who are we fielding ? As we land in Nairobi, memories of the All Africa Games in Kenya flood back, sitting at the newly built Kasarani Stadium, I remember Onyali\u2019s breath taking 400 metres relay anchor gold and the famous picture that saw her on her back at the finishing line, her legs spread out in the air\u2026..of \u201cEgbunike of Africa\u201d turning a hopeless situation to gold against a very strong Kenyan 400 metres relay team. Labours of our heroes past\u2026 For my wife Yesterday God added another year to my better half. Happy birth day sweet heart. Though I was not around to celebrate God\u2019s grace, I thanked Him for giving you to me, to us. A friend, a wife,a sister, a mother indeed. On behalf of the children, may you live long IJN. See you next week. Related",

        "author": "Janet Adetu",
        "text": "By Janet Adetu \u2026..continued This is the world of new technology that you decide either to be a part of or be quite nonchalant about. The truth is that it is important today to make an effort to be smartphone savvy at least have a basic idea. This is a continuation of part one so you are welcome to read on. Picture Profile I would not recommend for business purposes any form of communication comes through chat form. For your personal and social usage be selective in the pictures you set up as your profile page. Pictures tend to speak a thousand words. With close colleagues at work keep professional and personal conversations separate. Remember what you do not want published don\u2019t say it on your smartphone. Your profile picture is good to update your page however be careful not to draw too much attention to yourself by changing it ever so often. Formal/ Informal Usage Your phone is a gadget that can be very addictive and time consuming. Your phone should not be an excuse not to be in the present when you are among others. Please note that when you are going for a meeting or attending an appointment, whether you are conducting or attending the meeting, the phone is the least priority at that time. Your phone should be silently kept away for the duration. Nothing can be more impolite than answering a phone when you have got the attention of others. One missed phone call will not kill you, attend to missed calls and messages at a more appropriate time. Do not respond to text messages or emails in a formal gathering, dinner or speaking engagement. Speaker Phone For convenience you may decide to use the speaker phone or a hands-free gadget but when and where is essential and should not be overlooked. Whether the conversation is private, social or professional they should all be taken as confidential. If you are a business professional who relies heavily on your phone for business communications you may find yourself using the speaker phone more often. Be observant when you do this, you will need to be discreet in talking aloud as people around you will be forced to eavesdrop unconsciously. Social Media Social media today has taken over the wave length, for some it is what I would say the be all end all. The fact that you have Hi \u2013Tech smartness in your palm is now great but has its deterrents all the same. The use of Twitter, Facebook, Linked- In, You-tube, Instagram and many more forms of social media are becoming ever so popular today. Many businesses are tuning into these devices to stay in touch with clients, customers, viewers and business contacts. Your smartphone is a great device for keeping social contacts and reaching out to a large community. It is important to remember to sign off after use to protect your data. Be extra careful not to refer to anything work related during social discussions, information travels superfast and can be misinterpreted. Security Over and above all when you own a smartphone, you will realize that a lot of your life is slowly accumulated on to it. It is paramount that you secure your smartphone with a password or pattern ID identifiable by you alone. Currently there is a software that helps you track your phone when it has been stolen anywhere in the world. All smartphones are hot cakes in many places, guard your phones jealously. Battery One disadvantage I have found with smartphones phones is that the battery has a tendancy to run down pretty fast, many times you may be called when your phone is off, It can be quite frustrating for someone to call and find that you are not available. Carry an extra charged battery or a charger which can be used on your laptop, in your car or office. Cost Smartphones can be quite expensive depending on the specification and services provided; this may depend on the network you decide to use. It is important to factor in all the necessary costs before purchase. Buy the affordable version. Today in our current vibrant environment one can almost not do without a professional smartphone. They are also great for marketing and event broadcasts for entrepreneurs. Whatever the reason you have for obtaining a smartphone it most certainly must be used correctly watch out for my telephone etiquette tips, a real image killer if you get it wrong. Good luck as you continue to discover the swift wave of new technology on a daily basis right in your palms. Janet.adetu@gmail.com Related",

        "author": "Paul Bassey",
        "text": "By Paul Bassey Friday, September 11, Lubumbashi, 9am: T P Mazembe arrive the stadium named after them to train for the must win CAF Champions League encounter against Moroccans Moghreb Tetouane. A young man passes me and he looks very familiar. Could not place him. I get curious. Who is that? I ask. Samatta. Yes Samatta, the young Tanzanian who ran rings around our defenders during the Nations Cup qualifier in Dar ES Salaam. Samatta Nbwana Ali. I bid my time. After training I walk up to him. \u201cYoung man, you are the one who gave us sleepless nights in Dar Es Salaam?\u201d Samatta Nbwana Ali \u201cAre you a Nigerian?\u201d He asked with a hearty laugh. \u201cYes I answered\u201d \u201cSorry, very sorry I know you people wanted that match badly, so sorry\u201d Another round of laughter. But how come they played so well? In Nigeria we never thought they could give us so much problem. \u201c Yes. We knew that you were going to take us for granted. We knew that you think we will be easy, so we were very determined to play the games of our lives. \u201c Nigeria is a big football playing nation with stars worldwide. We were expecting a lot of fight and we were ready. The government was also there for us, training tour, equipment, everything and we were told to reciprocate the good will and the support\u201d Where they disappointed that the Nigeria they saw was not the Nigeria they expected? \u201c For us Nigeria was Nigeria. When we discovered that the stars we expected were not there, we were not fooled. For us Nigeria was Nigeria and we believed that whosoever was called up to represent Nigeria was going to be a tough nut to crack.\u201d Ten minutes into the match, Samatta and his colleagues found out that the Nigeria before them was beatable and they went for the jugular. \u201c Ten minutes into the match, in fact from the first minute, we had the feeling that we could win the match and we went for it. The crowd was behind us, the boys were fired up and we kept up the pressure\u201d Were they aware that we had a new coach, a new team and that we were not likely to present the type of opposition they expected? \u201c I said earlier that for us, Nigeria was Nigeria and all we knew was that they were going to be a formidable opposition. Another weapon we had is that the coach told us they were going to come and intimidate us, that they were likely to be confident, over confident that they will beat us, so we were to go at them from the blast of the whistle and it worked for us. We did not allow them to settle down. We took the battle to them and it worked\u201d Carl Ikeme? \u201c Who?\u201d The goal keeper. \u201c Ah he was their saviour. He stood between us and goals. He was very experienced. As the match progressed we became scared of him. Any time we approached the goalmouth, we started thinking how we could beat him and that affected our game even when the coach addressed that at half time\u201d The 23 year old No 9 for TP Mazembe believes if Tanzania plays as well as they did against Nigeria, they may spring a few surprises. In Congo DR, Lubumbashi, he is known as \u201c Samatta goal\u201d Signed from Simba club of Tanzania in 2011, this year has not been too prolific as he was yet to score for club in the Champions league group stage. Last Saturday, he was to change all that when in the 57th minute, he was the target of a floating pass, he ran to it, controlled warded off the stiff challenge of a defender before unleashing a pile driver for Mazembe\u2019s third goal in the 5-0 drubbing of Tettouane. Early this year Samatta was in Moscow for trials with CSKA and was set to become the first Tanzanian ever to play in the European Champions League. Playing for TP he says has helped him a lot given the professional way the club is run and the presence of a lot of stars from all over the continent. \u201c I am still young I know I have a lot of future ahead of me\u201d Is he looking forward to the return leg in Nigeria. Does he give Nigeria any chance to progress in the Qualifiers? \u201c Any country that underrates Nigeria does so at her peril. Nigeria remains a potential force any day. I know people have given the group to either Nigeria or Egypt. Let\u2019s see how it is going to be. However, after that impressive showing against Nigeria, don\u2019t take us for granted \u201c Laughter. Anekeme on my mind I salute the youth who represented Nigeria at the Commonwealth Youth Games, especially the athletic team that emerged winners of the track and field event. Before I wonder why we did not enter for other sports as much as possible, permit me to single out Aniekeme Alphonsus for commendation. A product of the MPN sponsored schools athletics competition in Akwa Ibom State, there is a future for this young girl if only the AFN will put more effort in investing in the youth. Aniekeme is returning from Samoa with three gold medals, a silver and a bronze. Incredible. The world beckons. See you next week. Related",

        "author": "Onochie Anibeze",
        "text": "By Onochie Anibeze London, July 25 I played football but not to the level that officials needed my passport for any outing. Injury did not allow me to proceed. I, therefore, don\u2019t have passport age as our footballers or young sports men and women do. When a footballer says his age, it is a common thing to ask weather it is real or passport age. I have never lowered my age for any reason but London Accreditation officials did that here. It was an error that delayed my accreditation for 24 hours. On arrival in London on Wednesday, a friendly and conversational volunteer had Mitchel Obi, the ace sports analyst and commentator and myself to the desk where we could sort out our accreditation. In less than three minutes Mitchel had his accreditation hanging on his neck. The story was not same for me. After few minutes of trying to verify my document from the computer, a lady volunteer on the accreditation desk told me \u201csorry, we cannot process your accreditation here. You may have to go to the Main Press Center.\u201d I asked what the problem was and she said the age in our document is not the same with that in your passport.\u201d I screamed, asking how that could have happened. They could not provide an answer. I was shocked. I filled my forms properly and never made any such mistake. Actually, the age in my document here in London is 10 years younger. I did not take it lying low and wanted to raise issues there at the airport. Mitchel laughed and said I was lucky for being 10 years younger. He recalled when such a thing happened to him and another visa and accreditation had to be issued to him as the one he carried were based on the wrong age in his form. Well, they did not need to do that here and the problem was sorted out at the Main Press Center near the Olympic Stadium 24 hours later. After they mixed up South Korea\u2019s anthem and flag for North Korea\u2019s during a soccer game for North Korea mine appears a lesser problem and I am no longer complaining. Prime Minister David Cameroun said yesterday that they would leave a legacy as hosts. I have turned 10 years younger in London, a legacy in a way. A Classy beggar When the sun shines here people go naked on the streets. Yes, this means nothing here. It\u2019s normal in Europe and America to almost be nude when it\u2019s summer and the sun warms up the atmosphere. What Africans at home will marvel at is normal here. But at the Brixton Train Station a beggar added something to the men and women who appeared to be competing over skimpy wears that are so transparent you will prefer to look away than to look on if you must keep your sanity. A man was playing some melodious tunes on saxaphone and the effect was so strong that some couples really coupled tightly while listening to the music. They were just there while many walked past. Some dropped money in a container beside the man. He was a beggar with a difference. At least, he provided entertainment and had something for his effort. I saw a similar scene at Victoria Train Station but the setting was different. The Jamaicans and other blacks in South London heat up the place and now that the Olympics are here it is a daily carnival in south London and the Olympic fever may be felt here than East London which hosts the games. The man in Victoria Station played great guiter and people dropped money but did not create scene, not so at Brixton where passers-by make a show of everything. The Olympic Games are here. Related",

        "author": "Ochereome Nnanna",
        "text": "By Ochereome Nnanna THE All Progressive Congress, APC, Federal Government\u2019s chief spokesman, Alhaji Lai Mohammed, was recently described by the regime\u2019s most vociferous critic, Chief Femi Fani-Kayode, as \u201cour mendacious Minister of Information, lying Lai Mohammed\u201d. Taking into account the Kwara-born politician\u2019s widely acknowledged tendency to employ the art of dissembling and deception in putting out information to the public, it is difficult to fault Fani-Kayode. It is difficult to wave this appellation aside as merely another hot gas from a \u201cstill grieving wailer\u201d as presidential spokesmen, Femi Adesina and Garba Shehu, would like to say. The Minister of Information and Culture, Alhaji Lai Mohammed, Lai actually preens with pride at the notion that he is an accomplished \u201cpropagandist\u201d. Propaganda and politics go hand-in-hand all over the world, but a smart government spokesman knows when to play politics with information (propaganda) and when to be sobre and give the public truthful and credible information. Lai Mohammed and his APC Federal Government do not seem to know where to draw the line. Immediately I saw the headline: \u201cFederal Government Deploys 100 Aircraft Rescue Abducted Dapchi Schoolgirls\u201d all over the front pages of the newspapers and on the social media, I knew this was another diet of glorified falsehood. When this came up for a hot debate in my tennis club, most of us argued heatedly that it was not possible. Does the Nigerian Air Force, NAF, even have 100 aircraft that can be deployed to search for missing persons? I doubt it. We are still jubulating that the Donald Trump Administration has agreed to sell twelve pieces of Super Tucano attack helicopters to us, but they are not for search-and-rescue. At this point a member pointed out humorously: \u201cperhaps they mean Ed\u2026 Airways\u201d (witches). It was not only Minister Lai Mohammed that was credited with the assertion that 20 military aircraft had already been deployed with \u201c80 more on the way\u201d. Even the National Security Adviser, NSA, retired Major General Babagana Monguno, was quoted as saying the same thing when he paid a courtesy call on Governor Ibrahim Geidam in Damaturu after the abduction of the 110 students of Government Girls Science Technical College, Dapchi. The Nigerian Air Force through its spokesman, AVM Olatokunbo Adesanya, however rebutted the story attributed to Monguno, explaining that the NSA \u201cspoke about the number of sorties (flight missions) so far conducted by the NAF aircraft in the course of searching for the missing girls within the period. Obviously, the number of sorties does not equate to the number of aircraft deployed\u201d. The mental picture of 100 aircraft being mobilised to search for the girls was cleverly packaged to give a grandiloquent twist to the rescue effort in order to divert attention from pathetic bungling that led to the abductions in the first place. The Dapchi schoolgirls\u2019 abduction was a carbon copy of the Chibok girls episode which took place almost four years ago under the regime of Goodluck Jonathan (and for which, in the main, the regime was sent packing by Nigerian electors). Lai Mohammed and his cohorts laboured to present this regime as \u201cmoving the earth\u201d in responding to the abduction unlike the previous time when doubts existed as to whether Boko Haram actually abducted the girls or they were used by some APC politicians to blackmail the Jonathan government as alleged in some quarters. The shock, for me, is that the abduction was allowed to take place at all. The late Dr. Michael Okpara was fond of saying: \u201cfirst fool no be fool. Second fool na him be proper foolish\u201d. Legendary British politician, Winston Churchill put it another way: \u201cThose who fail to learn from history are doomed to repeat it\u201d. It is only a fool that allows the same thing to happen to him twice. The Buhari administration should have known that the main reason that Boko Haram could not be defeated by Jonathan was because they had the Chibok girls in their custody. When he rode in triumphantly into power in \u201cshining armour\u201d on 29th May 2015, Buhari recognised the albatross posed to the nation by the Chibok girls kidnap in our anti-terror war, and he pledged that he would not consider declaring victory against Boko Haram until the Chibok girls had been rescued or accounted for. Almost three years on, what have we seen? Two batches of the Chibok girls numbering about 160 have been rescued, allegedly in exchange for undisclosed amounts in ransoms. Boko Haram obviously collected these monies and used them to rearm and replenish their \u201cdecimated\u201d fighting corps. By giving them money in exchange for the girls, we have ended up indirectly sponsoring or financing Boko Haram! Smart guys as they are, the insurgents decided to target another batch of schoolgirls, this time in Dapchi, Yobe State. I laugh when people say Dapchi was \u201cconsidered a safe place\u201d. Nowhere in the North East can be safe to keep students in boarding houses without adequate security! Boko Haram has spies, affiliates and sympathisers everywhere in the North. When the Army withdrew from the Dapchi School what did it expect? Any moron would know that Boko Haram\u2019s sympathisers even within the Army would inform them that the coast was clear. It will be interesting to see what the committee set up by the president to probe abduction will report, but personally, I smell sabotage. Lai Mohammed and other spokespersons of the APC Federal Government (including the Army) told us several times that Boko Haram had been \u201cso decimated that they no longer have the capacity to stage attacks\u201d. We were even told Boko Haram \u201cno longer occupies an inch of Nigerian territory\u201d. Just about a few days to the Dapchi abductions, the Army announced the \u201ccomplete defeat\u201d of Boko Haram. Lies, lies everywhere! Citizens are lured into a false sense of security, and Boko Haram reaps bountifully its grim harvests. How lower can we get? Related",

        "author": "Paul Bassey",
        "text": "By Paul Bassey The count down is on. I believe it is a co-incidence that the last friendly matches preparatory to the World Cup should be in the frame of what is now the 100 days count down to the World Cup. What is not a coincidence is that the organisers of the World Cup have lined up series of programmes aimed at bringing home the reality of an event that is still a subject of doubt in the western media. I have had to ask myself, what else will South Africa do to convince the world that it is not only ready, but capable of hosting and hosting well, the World Cup? The latest incident in the sceptic merry go round was the attempt to link the Angola incident involving Togo with South Africa, a country three hours away by air, not even neighbours at that. The count down is on, one hundred days to the first World Cup on African soil. For Nigerians, some Nigerians, the signs are ominous for a country that is yet, literally to start its World Cup programmes. I have had to argue at a different forum that we do not even have the luxury of three months. The World Cup, for all the teams, is just three weeks away. It is in three weeks that the players will be released by the clubs to head to their various camps. It is in three weeks that the coaches will have the benefit of working with full squads. It is in three weeks that a country will be required to plan and win the World Cup. The count down, therefore, has nothing to do with the readiness of the teams, rather it tends to sensitise us to the greatest single sport spectacle on earth. And in this wise, the South Africans can be assured of my vote. The South Africans have so woven life round the World Cup that long after the competition had gone, ( just one month) the legacy that will be left behind will be awesome. As anchor person of the MTN World Cup Programme, there is a segment called FIFA FEVER that highlights life in South Africa outside the field of play. This segment has so far exposed me not only to the benefits of the popular game called football, but also to the massive legacy that can be bequeathed to generations yet unborn. I know Nigeria is yet to host any competition in the magnitude of the World Cup, yet the few we have hosted I may not be able to point at any tangible left over especially as it impacts on the life of the citizenry. A few examples. Less than a week ago, I saw the turning of the sod of a grass root project that is expected to cost over 22 million dollars. When completed, among other things, there will be not less than 52 artificial turfs scattered all over South Africa. I quote \"Yesterday saw the launch of South Africa's biggest grassroots football development programme \"\u201d the construction of the 1st Football Turf of the 2010 FIFA World Cup Organising Committee South Africa Legacy Project This is the first of 52 Football Turfs \"\u201d one in each of the SAFA Regions \"\u201d which will be built as part of this project. Most of the sites identified to date are in the most rural areas of South Africa's provinces and will lay the basis of transforming football across the country. The Holy Family Combined School, where 1000 children from the Mogwase go to further their education, was chosen as the first site for the project because of its history of academic and cultural achievement which has seen them maintain a 100 per cent pass rate for the last four years. To date the National Lottery Distribution Trust Fund has committed 170.1 million rand to build 27 football turfs for the 2010 FIFA Legacy Project. This is the biggest project that the National Lottery has funded in sport since its inception. This commitment has allowed for the selection of the first 9 sites \"\u201d one in each province. A further two sites per province will then be identified. Following this, and contingent on additional funding, the remaining sites will be identified until all 52 sites have been developed. \"For the first time in their lives, thousands of our footballers across our country will be able to play the game they love on a decent football surface and this can only bode well for the quality of football and footballers that will be produced from this project. Each of the clubhouses will be equipped with a small education centre with computers where education, life-skills, leadership and health programmes will be conducted as part of a youth or community development programme. We call on these communities to take pride and ownership of these facilities, to look after them and to ensure that they are utilized to their benefit,\"\u009d said Danny Jordaan. CEO LOC FIFA World Cup. I can go on and on. Soth Africa has also used the widely accepted platform of football to fight diseases such as AIDS and Tuberculosis. Again let me make reference to the FIFA website. \"This year's FIFA World Cup in South Africa will present the world with a unique opportunity and platform to mount the fight against malaria, tuberculosis (TB) and HIV as well as other health threats to the African continent and in the game of football. So said chairman of the FIFA Medical committee and FIFA executive member, Michel D'Hooghe, at the start of the third International Football Medicine Conference in Sun City, South Africa. He further urged delegates to work together in facilitating the programmes to combat such diseases and look closer at injuries. About 300 sports physicians, physiotherapists and the team physicians of the 32 participating teams are gathering at the majestic and breathtaking Sun City to discuss recommendations on how to prevent injuries and improve the well-being of players. D'Hooghe said it was important that African football be the biggest benefactor during and after the 2010 FIFA World Cup. \"We must use this FIFA World Cup to fight the big three in Africa. We have to fight against malaria, TB and HIV. Those issues have to be fought hard as to help improving the standards of the game in Africa. We are here to learn about Africa, we have to listen to practitioners from this continent and see how best we can exchange ideas for the better of the game. \"We have a strong delegation from all over the African continent and the world including representatives from the 32 participating teams,\"\u009d explained D'Hooghe. \"This means that most of the relevant stakeholders are here. We are trying to bring knowledge to the game, to communicate and discuss the implementation of ideas because it is no good having all the ideas without a good implementation plan.\"\u009d FIFA Chief Medical Officer Dr. Jiri Dvorak, said the conference comes at an important period as Africa prepares for its biggest moment in sport history. He emphasised the importance of using the knowledge acquired during the conference to improve lives of footballers and the standard of the game. \"Our biggest goal is to minimise injuries in football. People have to realise that football is a safe sport,\"\u009d Dvorak said. \"The FIFA World Cup is the best opportunity to present football to the world. We have to show that we care for the health of players and improve the standard of the care.\"\u009d It was also in South Africa that I saw Mercedes Benz donating a state of the art bus to the Bafana Bafana and it made me wonder whether sponsorship is defined in relation to locality. Add to that my ignorance about the couturier that is ready to roll out Eagles World Cup suits, moving from the concrete to the ephemeral. When my son saw Manchester United players arriving for a league game all suited up with ties to match, he asked which Nigerian club does like wise. I said that though I once saw Kaduna United in suits, I can forgive the clubs but that our national team has no record of corporate appearance. The count down is on. I bet the South Africans have a lot of other packages up their sleeve and as you are reading this, I am off to Jo\u2019burg to be part of the historic programme. That lecture on Slattery The Very Reverend Dennis Joseph Slattery, founder of the all conquering Saint Finbarrs College, Akoka, was at various times football referee, chairman of the NFA and above all an educationist. Last Friday, the Old Boys of the school held a lecture in his honour, to discuss the falling standard of education in Nigeria and the way forward. Characteristically, it was the sports history of the school that stole the limelight. Mrs. Tayo Orewenme, who stood in for the Sports Minister and Chairman National Sports Commission set the ball rolling when she, in an eloquent speech reminded us of the contributions of Saint Finbarrs College to the sports history of the country. Like Otunba Anthony Odugbesan (Old Boys President) before her, she reeled out Stephen Keshi, Henry Nwosu, Henry Amike, Nduka Ugbade, Samson Siasia,\u00c2 Steven Akiga, Paul Bassey (yes yours truly) as some of those who had contributed to the sports development of the country. It was nostalgic sitting in the new multi purpose hall, a venue I had held sway for a year, as the food and dining hall prefect. See you next week. Related",

        "author": "Ola Ajayi",
        "text": "By Ola Ajayi IBADAN \u2013 100 years after, Ibadan indigenes and some notable sons and daughters still remember Adegoke Adelabu, popularly called \u201cPenkelemeesi\u201d. As they marked the post-humus centenary birthday yesterday in remembrance of the pre-independence politician for his various heroic works. Despite his giant political strides, none of his children is a politician. An Ibadan high chief, Aare Alaasa Olubadan, Oloye Lekan Alabi speaks with Vanguard why \u2018penkelemeesi\u2019 is still being remembered a century after. Who was Adegoke Adelabu, aka penkelemeesi? Lekan Alabi He was a precocious child and student. He was a prodigy and a man of deep intellect, an orator and a man who always pulled crowd. He attended C M S Elementary School, Kudeti, Ibadan and he had double promotion. He proceeded to the primary school in Mapo and he also had double promotion. From there, he went to the famous Government College Ibadan in Apata-Ganga. He also had double promotion, and all on scholarship. Anytime he had double promotion, he would lead his former seniors of two years by a wide margin. He never came second throughout his academic career; he always came first. The person that would come next to him would be a distant second position. Secondposition In 1935, he wrote entrance examination to Nigeria\u2019s highest institution then, Higher College, Yaba in Lagos, not Yaba College of Technology. The University of Ibadan, which started as a College of University of London, was established in 1948, which was 12 years after Adelabu had left the Higher College. So, he wrote entrance examination to Higher College, Yaba in 1935. He came first and then got a scholarship from the United African Company (UAC). But UAC stopped him in the second year from proceeding further. He was the grandfather of the current deputy governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) in charge of Financial System Stability, Mr. Bayo Adelabu. The pre-independence politician, who hailed from Kudeti in Ibadan, the Oyo State capital was Nigeria\u2019s first Federal Minister of Social Services and Natural Resources cum former opposition leader in the old Western Region House of Assembly. How peculiar mess became \u2018penkelemeesi\u2019 In places that we have visited particularly in the media houses, after our briefings, innocent editors, who are under 40 years of age would ask \u2018with all the encomiums you have poured on Adegoke Adelabu, with all the testimonies you have shown us in his academic prowess, how come the man was called \u2018penkelemesi\u2019 instead of peculiar mess.\u2019 Then, we have explained on several occasions that it was not Adegoke Adelabu, who said \u2018penkelemesi\u2019. Adegoke Adelabu, in his oration, was talking about peculiar mess of that time. Anywhere Adelabu went, he had large followers and supporters, singers, and drummers. When they heard him utter the word peculiar mess, the drummers threw up their drums, singing he had knocked them off with another vocabulary. They sang and also used their drums to say: Penkelemeesi, Adegoke Adelabu, penkelemeesi. Died in motor accident He was such a shining star, bright intellectual, great orator and mass mobiliser. But he suddenly met his death in a road accident at Ogere Remo in the present day Ogun State on March 25, 1958, and died at the age of 43. If Adelabu did not die on March 25, 1958, at the age of 43 due to a ghastly road accident, he would have been 100 years old on Thursday September 3, 2015, having been born on September 3, 1915. Birthdaycelebration Meanwhile, Adegoke Adelabu Post-Humous Centenary Birthday Celebration Planning Committee, chaired by Oloye \u2018Lekan Alabi, the Aare Alasa Olubadan of Ibadanland, has been set up. What Nigeria missed about him: It was on record that Adegoke Adelabu provided an effective leadership for the opposition in the Western Region House of Assembly during his lifetime, but what has Nigeria missed about him as far as opposition is concerned in the political arena in the country today? Those who went into politics like Adegoke Adelabu, purely for public service, are being missed because they had conscience and they could not be bought. Despite being the leader of opposition, the leader and later Premier of the Western Region, who was the leader of the Action Group (AG), Chief Obafemi Awolowo, invited Adegoke Adelabu to join the team from Western Region to the constitutional talks because they needed Adelabu\u2019s input. Adelabu\u2019sinput When Adelabu died, the Premier, Obafemi Awolowo and the Minister of Information, and later Local Government, Chief Anthony Enahoro, in their tributes, said they would miss a brilliant patriot and comrade because the Action Group, which was controlling the government of the Western Region must sit down and re-examine their memos or bills to the house for fear, if I may use that word, of Adegoke Adelabu\u2019s scrutiny. His Children avoiding politics In philosophy esoteric, philosophers believe that God does not duplicate any individual in the world. This is why you cannot say where the sons of Winston Churchill or the sons of Abraham Lincoln are. They may have their own profession and excel. God does not duplicate. You are here with your star, you fulfil your role and you will go. So, the same applies to Adegoke Adelabu\u2019s family. The sons and daughters of Adelabu are not cut for politics. But they have excelled and will continue to excel in their chosen professions. For example, one of the deputy governors of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), Chief Adebayo Adelabu, is a grandson of Adegoke Adelabu; the secretary of the planning committee, which I chair, Mr. Yinka Adelabu, is a Mass Communication graduate of University of Lagos (Unilag), and currently the Director of Simeon Adebo Human Development Centre of the Oyo State Government. Their father, the late Aderibigbe Adelabu was a banker. His younger brother, the late Aderemi Adelabu was principal, Government College Ibadan and later Executive Secretary of State Universal Basic Education Board (SUBEB), in Oyo State and so on. Early politicians had conscience The early politicians had conscience and loyalty to their parties. There was party supremacy in the Unity Party of Nigeria (UPN), Social Democratic Party (SDP), and early Alliance for Democracy (AD) period. I know this because I was the Chief Press Secretary to Chief Bola Ige, former governor of the old Oyo State. Formergovernor In 1983, based on the UPN constitution, States governors were the chairmen of the parties and their leader, Chief Obafemi Awolowo, was the national president and the presidential candidate. Uncle Bola (that\u2019s Chief Bola Ige) allowed us to sit in at their party executive meetings. You would see law and order, obedience to party constitution, which they inherited from Adelabu, Ahmadu Bello (the late Sarduana of Sokoto), Tafawa Balewa, Nnamdi Azikiwe, Akanu Ibiam, Dennis Osadebe, Obafemi Awolowo, Anthony Enahoro, FRA Williams, Mbonu Ojike, Dr. Eyor Ita, Dr. Mike Okpara. They all had ideologies. They did not change parties like they do now. They change parties the way mothers change babies napkins. What do we have today? People cross the camp when they are denied certain positions. They defect when their parties lose elections. Preparations on centenary birthday celebration I have led the Adegoke Adelabu family and centenary birthday planning committee to the former president, Chief Olusegun Obasanjo, in Abeokuta, Ogun State. Chief Obasanjo said Adegoke Adelabu was his political role model. So, he embraced my plea and the plea of Adegoke Adelabu to be the grand patron of the planning committee and the foundation.

        "title": "101 cogent reasons why Jonathan must be re-elected",
        "author": "Femi Aribisala",
        "text": "By Femi Aribisala WHERE two or three Nigerians are gathered, you can be sure we are busy running down our country. Nigerians like to bad-mouth Nigeria. This has played well into the narrative of the APC, which has used the social media to promote a false and prejudicial perspective of Nigeria under the Goodluck Jonathan administration. It is necessary to set the records straight. While the current PDP government is not without its shortcomings, there can be no doubt that it has achieved a lot in the last five years. Indeed, it is arguable that no government in the modern history of Nigeria has been as successful in transforming Nigeria for the better as the administration of Goodluck Jonathan. Economic milestones under GEJ Thanks to Goodluck Jonathan, Nigeria has been growing at an average of between 6 and 7 per cent a year. As a matter of fact, CNN Money projects that, after China and Qatar, Nigeria will be the fastest growing economy in the world in 2015. Under Jonathan, Nigeria has emerged as by far the largest economy in Africa. When Jonathan became president in 2010, Nigeria\u2019s GDP was $369: today, it is $510. Nigeria is now the 23rd largest economy in the world; which means we have overtaken such European countries as Austria and Belgium. It is not surprising therefore that, in 2012, President Barack Obama of the United States declared that Jonathan\u2019s Nigeria is \u201cthe world\u2019s next economic giant.\u201d Under Jonathan, the UNCTAD has ranked Nigeria as the number one country for foreign investments in Africa. According to the U.N., Nigeria now has the fourth highest rate of returns on investments in the world. It is a testament to Goodluck Jonathan\u2019s adroit management of the economy that the richest African is now a Nigerian. In 2010, when Jonathan came to power, Aliko Dangote was worth $2.1 billion. This grew under Jonathan to $25 billion. Jonathan has also gone a long way to diversify the Nigerian economy. Under his stewardship, the non-oil sector has grown at a tremendous rate of up to 8 percent a year. Thanks to Jonathan, agriculture now accounts for 22% of Nigeria\u2019s GDP, more than oil and gas which only account for 15.9%. Visionary GEJ gave a 3 billion naira grant to Nollywood in 2014; cementing Nigeria firmly as the third largest producer of films in the world. As a matter of fact, Nollywood now accounts for 1.4% of Nigeria\u2019s GDP. Transformation of agriculture Agriculture has been remarkably transformed from subsistence to commercial farming under Jonathan\u2019s administration. Prior to Jonathan\u2019s presidency, we had a food import bill of 1.4 trillion naira. This has gone down by more than 50% to less than 700 billion. With the innovation of dry-season rice-farming, Nigeria has reached 60% self-sufficiency in rice production. Indeed, we now expect to be completely self-sufficient by the end of this year. With continuity in government, Nigeria should soon become self-sufficient in food production. According to the Food and Agricultural Organisation of the United Nations, Nigeria is already the largest producer of cassava in the world, thanks to Jonathan\u2019s policies. It is significant that Northern farmers donated 5 billion naira worth of yams to Buhari\u2019s presidential election campaign. They would not have been able to do this if it were not for Goodluck Jonathan\u2019s transformation of agriculture. Through the innovative electronic-wallet system of the Jonathan administration, 10.5 million Nigerian farmers were given cell-phones at a cost of over 60 billion naira. This gives them direct access to the government for fertilizer, chemicals and seedlings. The Jonathan government has also built six strategically-located perishable cargo airports in close proximity to the nation\u2019s food-baskets in Ilorin, Jalingo, Jos, Lagos, Makurdi and Yola. Anti-corruption APC propaganda deceives Nigerians into believing that the Jonathan government condones corruption. However, there are far more reliable determinants of Nigeria\u2019s level of corruption than APC talking-points. Transparency International publishes annually an internationally-recognised corruption index of most of the countries in the world. According to Transparency, Nigeria has become increasingly less corrupt under Goodluck Jonathan. In 2001, Nigeria was the 2nd most corrupt country after Bangladesh. By 2010, it had become the 43rd most corrupt country. By 2014 still, our position had improved to 38th. No government in Nigeria has been as successful in tackling corruption structurally as that of Goodluck Jonathan. Jonathan fought the petroleum subsidy scam by identifying 370 billion naira of fraudulent claims. Between 1980 and 2010, 776 billion naira was lost to corrupt fertilizer racketeering in Nigeria. This came to an end in one fell swoop under Jonathan. Fertilizer distribution to farmers was dramatically sanitized by the e-payment system. Today, the corrupt fertilizer middlemen have all disappeared. By also instituting e-payment systems in the civil-service, over 60,000 ghost-workers were removed from the salary register; saving over 200 billion naira. Jonathan has also sanitized the Nigerian banking system. He introduced the Government Integrated Financial Management System (GIFMS) which reduced physical movement of cash and curbed corruption and money-laundering. Under Jonathan, dinosaur bank Managing Directors who had largely privatized the banking system were removed and a considerable amount of indigent loans recovered. Jonathan also stabilized the banking system by launching the Asset Management Company of Nigeria (AMCOM) which mopped up trillions of naira of bad loans and re-established confidence in the Nigerian economy. Employment creation One of the major challenges encountered by the Jonathan administration has been in the area of youth employment. Nigeria is a young country, throwing up some 1.8 million job-seekers into the employment market every year. The government has achieved more in this area than most people seem to realise. For example, in 2013, the Jonathan administration created 1.6 million jobs. The establishment of such innovative programs like Nagropreneurs and Youth Enterprise with Innovation in Nigeria (YOUWIN) has gone a long way to empower Nigerian youth farmers and entrepreneurs with grants, training and mentorship. Jonathan has instituted internship schemes to enhance the capacity of university graduates to secure gainful employment. Government innovation has also led to a number of Community Service Schemes (CSS) under the Subsidy Reinvestment and Empowerment Program (SURE-P). A 220 billion naira Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises Development Fund has been instituted to empower graduates and other young people to own their own businesses. The government has also been promoting access to capital for SMEs with government bank guarantees and micro-finance. The National Industrial Revolution Plan (NIRP), and the National Enterprise Development Program (NEDEP) are all expected to generate millions of jobs to accommodate Nigeria\u2019s teeming job-seekers. Manufacturing One of the unsung success stories of the Jonathan administration has been in the area of manufacturing. All indications point to the revival of the industrial sectors and the Small- and Medium-scale Enterprises under Goodluck Jonathan. FBN Capital, a leading financial services group, confirms there has been \u201ca dramatic increase in manufacturing growth\u201d in Nigeria under Goodluck Jonathan. Indeed, under his administration, the manufacturing sector has been the major driver of economic growth in Nigeria. The sector has been growing faster than tele-communications and oil and gas. For example, it grew from 14% in 2012 to 22% in 2013. Jonathan reactivated the textile industry with an investment of 150 billion naira. In 2014, Olam Rice Farm, the biggest rice processing mill in Africa, was commissioned in Rukubi, Nasarawa State. Nigeria is now self-sufficient in cement and is, in fact, a net exporter. Jonathan energized private sector-led industrialization by launching the National Industrial Revolution Plan (NIRP), a scheme which strengthened over 500 manufacturing industries. An industrial revolution has been re-ignited with the revival of automobile assembling plants in Nigeria under Goodluck Jonathan. Nigeria has now become a major destination for multinational investment in car manufacturing. Under GEJ, big auto giants, such as Peugeot, Nissan and Hyundai, now assemble or manufacture their cars, SUVs, trucks and buses in Nigeria. Innoson Vehicle Manufacturing Company, our flagship indigenous auto-maker, began the sale of made-in-Nigeria cars and SUVs within the framework of the Jonathan administration. Healthier Nigerians In 2010, when Jonathan became acting president, Nigerian life expectancy was 47 years. Today, it is 54 years; an improvement of 7 years. Under Jonathan, adroit application of SURE-P funds has reduced the maternal mortality ratio in Nigeria by 26%. Thanks to Jonathan, Nigeria has become Guinea Worm free; a disease previously affecting 800,000 Nigerians yearly. For the past nine months, Nigeria has become free of the scourge of polio. Under Jonathan, Nigeria has also remained Ebola free. Billionaire philanthropist Bill Gates notes that: \u201cThe infrastructure Nigeria has built to fight polio actually made it easier for them to swiftly contain Ebola.\u201d Advancement of education Under Jonathan, Nigeria\u2019s education budget has more than doubled. There has been a 10 million increase in school enrolment, with every Nigerian child now having the opportunity to go to school. There has also been a 75% increase in O Level credit passes in Maths and English in Nigeria since Goodluck Jonathan came to power. Jonathan established 14 new federal universities; an unprecedented feat in Nigeria. There is now a federal university in every state of the federation. Jonathan also built 150 Almajiri Schools in 13 states in the North; something Northern rulers like Buhari failed to do. The kidnapping of the Chibok girls itself reflects the annoyance of the Boko Haram that, under Jonathan, many Northern girls are now going to school. Development of infrastructure At the inception of the Jonathan administration, only 5,000 kilometers of federal roads in Nigeria were motorable. However, in five years, the administration has built over 20,000 kilometers of roads. It has rehabilitated 22 airports nationwide. 5 new international airport terminals have been built in Lagos, Kano, Port Harcourt, Abuja and Enugu. Akanu Ibiam airport in Enugu has been upgraded to international status. 3,500 kilometers of rail lines have been constructed. You can now travel today by rail from Lagos to Kano; Enugu to Port-Harcourt to Makurdi, to Jos, to Bauchi and Gombe. Before Jonathan, only I million passengers were carried by rail. This has now grown to 5 million. Recently, KPMG proclaimed Nigeria\u2019s proposed high speed rail project as one of the global top 100 world-class infrastructures, expected to connect major cities at a cost of $13 billion. These achievements and more show conclusively that Jonathan deserves a second-term in office. He should be supported by all well-meaning Nigerians. d more show conclusively that Jonathan deserves a second-term in office. He should be supported by all well-meaning Nigerians. Related",

        "title": "Military option won\u2019t work in Abidjan",
        "author": "Owei Lakemfa",
        "text": "By Owei Lakemfa IN the old Western movies, there were usually the \u2018good men\u2019 who were on the side of the law or justice. On the other hand were the \u2018bad men\u2019 who were usually outlaws. In the mainly linear plot, the bad men cause a lot of havoc but at the end of the film, they are taken out , usually in a shootout. In the script by the West, Laurent Gbagbo is a bad man. It therefore seems that the best option for humanity is to go in, pick the bad man and his collaborators, kick them out and let Ivorians live happily thereafter. This is what should happen in the movies, but reality is different. I am not a fan of Gbagbo, but I have at the back of my mind the fact that Cote d\u2019Ivoire is quite rich and that Gbagbo is an obstacle to the fleecing of the country by France and the West. So our motives as Africans are not the same as those of the West and the United Nations it controls. Secondly, Gbagbo\u2019s Pan Africanist antecedents contrasts with those of the Pro-IMF/World Bank background of his rival, Alassane Ouatarra, obviously America and the West will prefer to do business with the latter. Using the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) as executors of the military gambit would save a country like France men and materials and would also guarantee its much needed military bases in that country. Although the Gbagbo group should be condemned for tearing up the election results, but ECOWAS and the African Union ought to give more ear to Gbagbo\u2019s demand for a recount of the ballot. I do not have any doubt that a military intervention will result in a dreadful bloodbath of Africans. This is why Nigeria with over two million citizens living in Cote d\u2019Ivoire should be more cautious. Another danger is that the military option is likely to result in the dissolution of the Ivorian armed forces and the police; the security implications for the country will be quite immense. If this happens, the core of the new armed forces is likely to be made up of the rebel army . This means that there will be serious ethnic and religious schism in the new military whose officer corps will be northern and Muslim. It is also not unlikely that civil war may result from a military intervention. For a country that has barely survived a civil war, a second one may be more devastating and may lead to a breakup of the country. Also, the army rather than surrender, may resort to guerrilla warfare which can be quite problematic and last a generation. If a super power like the United States (US) and its allies, have been unable to defeat the guerrilla struggle in Afghanistan, it might not be easy defeating an armed insurgency by a defeated Ivorian military. The US might have had better results pressurising and negotiating with the Taliban government than a direct invasion in which it won the strike but not the peace. Part of the problem was that a rebel army was backed to make a sweep of Afghanistan, and the war degenerated into a tribal one. The same can be said of Iraq; during the 1990 Gulf War, President Bush Snr got to the gates of the country after crippling the Iraqi army, but rather than go for the kill, he turned back. Thirteen years later, his son went in for the kill and US has since then got sucked into a war it would not accept failure, but cannot win. It might have made more sense to dialogue even with a defeated Saddam Hussein in prison, than to murder him and his colleagues and turn historic Iraq into a huge centre of anarchy where massacres no longer make news. It is not that the sack of a country\u2019s entire armed forces and the police should not be carried out if necessary, but it should be in revolutionary circumstances such as in 1917 Russia, 1949 China and 1959 Cuba. But if it is a mere leadership change as in Cote d\u2019Ivoire, it becomes far more complex. When rebels of the Somali National Movement (SNM)pressed southwards against Mohammed Siad Barre intent on a military victory, peace moves were rejected and the Somalia armed forces and police were utterly destroyed in January 1991. Today, two decades later, that country remains synonymous with anarchy and what a failed state looks like. Mengistu Haile Mariam the Ethiopian strongman fled on May 21, 1991 and the rest of his Amharas-dominated cabinet sought a political settlement with the advancing Ethiopian Peoples Revolutionary Democratic Front, a coalition led by the Tigre Peoples Liberation Front. The latter refused and overran Addis Ababa. Today 20 years later, that victorious coalition still employs force to dominate its opponents. To me, a negotiated political settlement might have been better , than an outright military solution. This is what the government in Sri Lanka would come to learn after rejecting peace negotiations with the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (Tamil Tigers) Uganda can be said to be one of the luckiest countries in the world; it survived two civil wars which led twice to the dissolution of the armed forces. The first was in 1979 when the human butcher, Idi Amin was removed and the second was the ascendancy of Yoweri Museveni and his National Resistance Movement. Unfortunately, partly due to the complete insistence on military victory and domination, the country has not been free from armed conflicts since the Amin era. In contrast, even when it was clear that the rebels in the Nigerian civil war had been defeated, the Yakubu Gowon regime pursued a reconciliatory, reintegration and participatory programme which guaranteed peace. We must not lose sight of the fact that the primary reason for the Ivorian elections was to re-unify the south and the north; employing a military option to complete the electoral process will be a defeat of the reunification goal.

        "author": "Treena Kwenta",
        "text": "\u2013 the funloving, but hardworking single parent By Treena Kwenta Hi Readers! Based on what nanny had told me, I did my best to avoid Seb too, so that peace can reign. I couldn\u2019t trust myself not to bring up the registry wedding issue if I got him on my own. I was successful in this for a day or so, but when my siblings arrived from down south, that changed immediately. \u201dSis,\u201d said my brother Joe, jovially on telephone, \u201cthanks for this very comfortable accommodation which you and Seb arranged for us. It must have cost you a bomb, but we\u2019re worth it. The Lord says \u2018a labourer is worth is wages\u2019. You didn\u2019t disgrace His Holy name by checking his servants into a crummy rat-infested place. God bless you, my dear sister. Now, we\u2019re here on duty.\u201d \u201dYou\u2019re welcome, Joe dear. Seb\u2019s responsible for the type of accommodation you got, so, the credit for a satisfactory one goes to him. You\u2019re on duty? I thought you\u2019re here because the bride is your niece.\u201d\u201c \u201dYes, there\u2019s that, but most especially, as she\u2019s a distant member of my church, we\u2019ve come to rejoice with her and her bridegroom and the rest of the family, and assist with prayers. I learnt Milwan has arrived. I haven\u2019t seen him yet. Where\u2019s he staying?\u201d \u201cHe\u2019s staying along with the bridegroom and his parents in one of Seb\u2019s flats, just ten minutes by car away from your hotel. I saw him this morning, and he asked for you. He knows where you are, so, expect a visit from him tonight. He has to be with our in-laws, so that he can supervise the services they\u2019re getting from Michel and Tayo\u2019s steward. It isn\u2019t that we don\u2019t trust Michel, but you know how these people are when your back is turned. They may deliberately not answer a call, or forget to wait at table. We couldn\u2019t take that risk. These people are coming to Africa for the first time.\u201d \u201dYou\u2019re right, sis. We have to make our guests feel truly welcome, so that our daughter will be well-received into their family. Well done.\u201d \u201dThanks, bro. Milwan will bring the bridegroom to you.\u201d \u201dThat would be great, sis. Now, can you and Seb come see me this evening?\u201d \u201dEr, I don\u2019t know how convenient that will be, Joe. We\u2019re so busy over here right now. Can we meet tomorrow evening, after the wedding?\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t believe you\u2019re busy, sis. Rather, I think it has to do with you and Seb avoiding each other because he failed to tell you that Heather and Robert were going to have their registry wedding in London. Childish of both of you at a time like this.\u201d Ordinarily, I would have been very rattled by what my brother had said, but in the last few days, I had received several shocks which had hardened me to events. I merely sighed and asked my brother why he thought that Seb and I were behaving childishly by avoiding each other. \u201dLook sis, I don\u2019t want to say that I\u2019m disappointed in you this time around, but of what effect has the lectures you\u2019ve been getting from brother Gabriel over the years been, if at your daughter\u2019s wedding, you\u2019re not on speaking terms with her father? Mind you, it\u2019s not as if this was an outside child, but a child born of a loving union in a legitimate marriage. Even where ex-marital partners have been having bitter feuds, they sheathe their swords, and come together during their child\u2019s wedding, to present a loving common front. How do you think the in-laws will feel when they notice that you and your ex-husband barely speak to each other?\u201d \u201dBro, thank you very much for this discussion. I\u2019m really lucky to have a brother who\u2019s interested in my affairs and happiness. God bless you. But a point to note, bro., is that Seb and I are on speaking terms. Granted we\u2019re not falling all over each other, but there\u2019s no way I can ever stop talking to Seb. Whoever told you that we\u2019re not on speaking terms is wrong.\u201d \u201dWell, Seb didn\u2019t specifically say that, but it was implied when he told me of the frostiness between you. He admitted that he made a faux pas when he forgot to tell you of the registry wedding, but\u2026\u201d \u201dSorry to butt in bro., but the same Seb told nanny that he didn\u2019t tell me of the wedding because of the intense cold and snow this year in Britain. He didn\u2019t say he forgot. He said he was afraid for my health because cold doesn\u2019t agree with it. Bro, you know that I have no problem with intense cold whatsoever, and Seb was not telling the truth. Nanny of course bought what he said, and sang his praises. I didn\u2019t bother to correct her. This was all in the interest of peace.\u201d \u201dI know. I know. He tried that cold thing with me, but I reminded him that we used to call you \u2018snow baby\u2019 in the family, on account of your love for cold weather. That jogged his memory, and he said he had forgotten that, and he assumed that like him, you would hate to be in Britain this winter, and he didn\u2019t want you to feel obliged to come. He thought it was best for you not to know at the time. He was afraid you might fall sick and be unable to attend this traditional wedding. He added that if he had remembered that you tolerate the cold very well, he would have told you about the wedding.\u201d \u201dDo you believe all that, bro?\u201d \u201dLet\u2019s give him the benefit of the doubt, my dear sister, and put all that behind us. Anyway, I learnt that the bridegroom\u2019s parents, though in London, didn\u2019t think it was necessary for parents to be present, so, Seb probably acted for the best.\u201d \u201dHm, if you say so. You want both of us at your hotel this evening? What time? Seven? Okay, thanks a lot. Oh, I should tell him? I thought it would be best if he got the invitation direct from you.\u201d \u201dAlright, Treena dear. I\u2019ll speak with him. I want you both to arrive together in the same vehicle. Let\u2019s start practising from now, the togetherness that will be on display at tomorrow\u2019s wedding. Okay, sis. See you both later.\u201d \u201dAh, hold on, Treena. Ify is here. She says to tell you that she\u2019s leaving for your place now in a taxi and that, she\u2019ll rather stay with you and the gals than with me in this hotel room. Can you beat that? I thought we would make this trip a romantic one in a hotel and recapture all that loving feelings that we\u2019ve put on the back burner for many years now, but she\u2019s rejecting all that in favour of being with her sister-in-law and her friends. Poor me! Hold on for her.\u201d \u201dHello Treena, my lord and master,\u201dboomed Ify\u2019s voice. \u201dHow una dey o?\u201d \u201dIfy, it\u2019s nice of you to come support us here. God bless you , my sister.\u201d \u201dAh, it\u2019s my duty to be here o! Funke and I are coming down, so, that we can help wherever we can.\u201c \u201dThat\u2019s great. I\u2019ll text down the address, or better still, I could pick you up later this evening when Seb and I come to see Joe.\u201d \u201cEr, that would be too late. We want to be there with the gals right now. That\u2019s where all the action is. Your precious brother is complaining about being left alone. He wants me to stay enclosed with him in this hotel room, watching the telly? No way! Funke is anxious to be at the venue too. The address is on the invitation card. We\u2019ll take a taxi. See you later, love.\u201d The gals were glad when they heard that Joe wanted to see Seb and me. \u201dGod has answered our prayer,\u201dsaid Becky in a relieved voice. \u201dWe prayed about something like this. Let everyone see you and Seb behaving like you were still in love with each other, and still together. I hate weddings where it\u2019s obvious that the parents of the bride or the bridegroom are alive, but no longer together, and are not on good terms. This one here must not reflect that, please. We thank God for using Joe to eliminate that.\u201c Seb sent me a text asking if he could come over to my chalet. I replied, saying he\u2019s free to come. Ten minutes later, he came, bringing presents to the gals. He knows our tastes, so, everyone was satisfied. You should see how the gals received him. It was like he\u2019s their Prince Charming. They clung to him, hugging him and patting him on the back. He lapped it all up gladly. No, I didn\u2019t join this circus, but looked on, amused. At last, he came over to hold me in a tight hug. There are hugs and there are hugs. This was meant to crush my fragile bones, for whatever purpose, but I bore it and smiled at him. \u201dAre we ready to go see Joe?\u201dhe asked. I nodded. He took the wheel in an old Honda he normally parks away for his use in Jos, and we left. As we were driving out, the taxi bringing Ify and Funke was driving in, so we stopped and there was a noisy joyous cries of welcome. On the way, he began to apologize for what he had done, saying it just happened, and that it wasn\u2019t meant to hurt me. \u201dTreena dear, you know I\u2019ll never hurt you deliberately, don\u2019t you? I should have told you of the registry wedding, but it just happened that I failed to. I can\u2019t really give a convincing reason, although I mentioned the cold to nanny, and something else to Joe. Please forgive, okay?\u201d I nodded. He sighed. \u201cIt\u2019s a nodding session today, isn\u2019t it? Well, forgive me, Treena dear and start speaking to me again. Unloosen the tongue, girl!\u201c I gave another stubborn nod. Joe wasn\u2019\u2018t having any of my nodding business. He got Seb to apologize in his presence, and told me to bare my mind on the issue, and then accept the apology. Frankly, the hurt has since evaporated. I was only making a pretence of keeping it up, to make Seb anxious. \u201dSeb, I forgive what you did. I was terribly hurt, but that hurt is getting less everyday. Let\u2019s put it all behind us.\u201d He sprang to his feet to hug me. This time it was a gentle and remorseful one. I hugged him back and Joe prayed for us. We were about to leave when Milwan came in with Robert and his parents. He was surprised to see us with Joe. \u201dMum, dad, hope all\u2019s well,\u201dhe said, when he could get us on our own. \u201dNothing\u2019s happened that I don\u2019t know, has it?\u201d \u201dAll\u2019s well, son,\u201dSeb and I said in chorus. That reassured him and we went to join Robert and his parents who were chatting with Joe. Benny later joined us and he was introduced to the visitors. \u201c\u201dWhere are aunties Ify and Funke?\u201d\u201c Milwan asked. Joe explained that they were over at the family house. Later, we all had dinner, along with Joe\u2019s church members in the hotel\u2019s restaurant. It was an enjoyable evening. Seb and I escorted the in-laws back to the flat and had a night cap. It was close to midnight when we returned to the family house. \u201dGod bless Joe for inviting us over,\u201csaid Seb, as we bid each other \u2018good night\u2019. The in-laws were impressed to see such happy togetherness.\u201d \u201cTrue. The meeting was timely.\u201d I agreed. Well, some window dressing always helps, isn\u2019t it? Tara. Related",

        "title": "Even If Galadima Wins",
        "author": "Ikeddy Isiuzo",
        "text": "By Ikeddy Isiuzo THIS piece is going to press 72 hours before the elections in Khartoum, in which Nigeria\u2019s Ibrahim Galadima is a candidate. The concern here is not whether he wins or not. I am more bothered about the way we are, the way we elect to be and the consequences for Nigeria. Galadima was a late entrant to the contest for one of the CAF seats and a possible place in FIFA. The story was going well, except that some knew that the circumstances of Galadima\u2019s candidacy did not give room for a good consideration of his chances at the elections and the apparent possibilities. Nigerians were given the impression that the seat in contention was a Nigerian slot. There was nothing of the sort. A further impression was that Dr. Amos Adamu, whose problems in FIFA, resulted in the vacancy, held his position on behalf of Nigeria. It is on record that only Dr. Adamu was in the best position to explain how he won places in CAF and FIFA. Those who sought to replace him suffered from a poor knowledge of the workings of CAF and FIFA, contrary to claims that they had contacts that will gain the seats for Galadima whose candidacy generated controversies right from the start. Was it right to have named a replacement for Dr. Adamu while his case was still on appeal? Some thought Dr. Adamu had no case and that CAF should have declared his seat vacant though his tenure expires in 2013. CAF thought differently, knowing that an Adamu victory at the Court of Arbitration for Sports could put it in a fix. Those who want Adamu to vacate the CAF seat are confusing it with the FIFA seat which expired; hence, anyone who deems himself qualified could contest for it. After the initial rush for the CAF seat, Nigeria reversed to the FIFA slot. Who started this project and what was the thinking? We were told it was Nigeria\u2019s project and it must succeed. Still from the beginning, it was built on a faulty foundation. The Nigeria Football Association was forced to support Galadima\u2019s candidacy. Did we think the world was unaware of this? Only two weeks ago, Information Minister, Mr. Labaran Maku said the Federal Government was unaware of Galadima\u2019s candidacy. How is this possible for an election that we were told was a Nigerian project? Where is the lobbying that is supposed to come from government? Supposed promoters of the Galadima candidacy spent the past few weeks exposing weaknesses of the exercise, which they thought, would benefit from strident criticisms of Dr. Adamu\u2019s decision to appeal the FIFA decision. They want Dr. Adamu to withdraw the case, to prove his support for Galadima. When did they know the support was important? How were they going to get it when they are barely on nodding terms with Dr. Adamu? Did they have to wait until they got to Khartoum to know this? The discordant views from home worked against Galadima more than lack of support from others. Without firm grounds at home, he was in trouble from the beginning. A laughable development in the entire process is the discovery of Dr. Adamu as the course of the challenges the candidate faced. There are times that we ascribe too reach to Dr. Adamu. This attitude has always provided grounds for people to cover their failures. There is always someone to blame. How could he tell CAF President Isa Hayatou what to do? Is it reasonable to expect that Dr. Adamu will not fight if he thought he had a chance to restore his honour? Does he not have a right to fight for his name? Was the expectation that Galadima\u2019s election would be more important to Dr. Adamu than his name? Did the promoters of the Galadima effort go through any serious analysis of his chances and the work elections at this level require? I think they were too busy talking to themselves, praising the candidate and believing that his chances were bright. I heard that in CAF, where everyone looks for the slightest defect of a candidate, possible voters were asking whether this Galadima was different from the one his members practically ejected from his chairmanship of the NFA. If Nigerians felt he was not good enough to manage their football is he the best candidate they could send to Africa. When we make evaluation of the efforts in Khartoum, we will note that we were so subsumed in race to replace Dr. Adamu, supposedly to retain Nigeria\u2019s slot that we never thought through the processes that could grant success in the election. However, haven started by sharing blames his supporters have limited their chances to make a success of a project they never supported, contrary to all the noise.

        "title": "14 Nigerian banks to enjoy $7bn reserve",
        "author": "Les Leba",
        "text": "By Les Leba \u201cThe report of the 14 Nigerian banks which had been appointed as Asset Managers of Nigeria\u2019s reserves was carried on the back page of The Guardian Newspaper of the 5th of October 2006. The report confirmed that \u201calready deposits worth $7bn representing part of the apex bank\u2019s share of foreign reserves estimated at about $38bn had been released to the consortium of bankers, according to the CBN Head of Corporate Affairs, Mr. Festus Odoko\u201d. \u201cIn this event, the CBN had made good its promise to invite Nigerian banks which have consolidated $500m capital base to a \u201cforeign reserves banquet\u201d if they show evidence of collaboration with internationally recognized financial houses. The Guardian report further confirmed that all 14 Nigerian banks are already associated with reputable affiliates, but it is not clear whether or not the M.O.U. between both parties involves joint responsibility for profits and loss, with global best banking practice and ethical standards, or if collaboration is simply glorified banking correspondence. \u201cNonetheless, critics wondered if the 14 banks which had just raised their capital base under duress to N25bn could also raise additional capital of about N35bn in so short a space of time to qualify for management of CBN\u2019s reserves, in which case, CBN may have quietly dropped this requirement so as to pursue its declared agenda! \u201cBut whose interest is CBN serving? The sum of $7bn is a huge sum of money in any currency and disbursement of such huge public funds should not be treated with levity. Although in the Guardian report \u201cMr. Odoko confirmed that the appointment of the 14 banks was ratified by the Investment Committee of the CBN on Tuesday, 3/10/06, the deposits worth $7bn had already been shared by Thursday morning, 5/10/06! \u201cNigerians may not realize that with one stroke of the pen, the CBN had committed Nigeria to possibly its largest single investment ever! The questions is whether or not the returns from this huge investment will stimulate productivity and employment, and improve our social welfare. If not, who will benefit from this biggest ever single investment paid upfront by the Nigerian nation? Yes, you have got it, the 14 banks who will wear broad smiles to their overseas vaults! Although CBN has not yet declared what returns it would demand from the 14 fattened beneficiaries, it is unlikely that the CBN will get more than prevailing international cost of about 3% interest per annum for such placements. \u201cIncidentally, the 14 favoured banks are at liberty to invest anywhere in the world! Thus, while we are pleading with foreign investors to come to Nigeria to support economic and industrial development, we are simultaneously exposing our hard earned foreign exchange to a consortium of Nigerian banks which have a consolidated capital base of less than $3bn for minimal gain, without asking for some measure of audit control or equity participation. \u201cNigerian banks have found it unattractive to invest in the real sector, particularly the income and employment generating SMEs; so, it would be foolhardy to expect that the largesse of $7bn low interest loan would change their attitude to the Nigeria economy. The bizarre strategy of a minimal returns of 3.5% for a $7bn investment without a time limit is amplified by CBN\u2019s willingness to conversely pay interest rates of between 12 and 17% for monies it borrows from the domestic capital market in Nigeria! \u201cIndeed, in the event that the 14 banks are free to repatriate all or part of the $7bn back to the Nigerian capital market, it is not difficult to predict where their interests would lie: you have got it; the obvious destination would be further patronage of government\u2019s treasury bills and bonds where they can earn rates of return of up to 17% from government borrowings! \u201cWorse still, moneys so collected for sale of government bills and bonds are regrettably not tied to any specific infrastructural project but are inexplicably just kept idle in CBN vaults. \u201cMr. Odoko, the CBN mouthpiece had also indicated in the Guardian report quoted above that \u201cthe $7bn represents the apex bank\u2019s share of the foreign reserves!\u2019 I beg your pardon! What work did the CBN do to earn $7bn? The Constitution does not separate a share of dollar reserves for the CBN; our crude oil earnings belong to the Nigerian people as expressed by the three tiers of government; the Senate and the House of Representatives would have defaulted in their constitutional duties if CBN is not invited to defend why $7bn of our reserves should be \u2018given\u2019 to 14 banks without oversight approval.\u201d The above is a summary of the above article, which was first published in October 2006. Not surprisingly, less than two years after Soludo\u2019s lauded banking consolidation, most Nigerian banks tittered on the verge of collapse. There has never been any confirmation that the 14 banks repaid the $7bn \u201csoft loan\u201d granted by the CBN before the banking crisis; consequently, it is more likely that Nigeria\u2019s $7bn may have ultimately \u2018gone with the wind\u2019 during the ensuing financial meltdown! Nonetheless, such probable default has not stop the banking sector from receiving additional largesse in excess of N5tn ($30bn) from lifelines from CBN and AMCON interventions between 2009 and 2010! Notwithstanding, CBN\u2019s misguided generosity the banking sector has remained resistant to providing the real sector with loanable funds at affordable rates to stimulate industrial rejuvenation, economic growth and increasing employment opportunities. In the above event, it may be necessary for the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission to take a closer look at the circumstances and the ultimate fate of CBN\u2019s extraordinary loan of $7bn to the banks in 2006; Nigerians surely have a right to know, especially now that a new set of managers has been selected, complete with their own parastatal establishment to manage the $1bn assets designated as our sovereign wealth fund, while we still go cap-in-hand to solicit for development loans with oppressive interest rates.

        "author": "Henry Boyo",
        "text": "By Henry Boyo The Chairman of the Special Presidential Panel for Recovery of Public Property, Mr. Okoi Obono-Obla, recently, (Sept. 7th 2018), noted in a NAN report in Abuja, that the Agency is continuing its investigations to \u201crecover monies that have been taken away from the people of Nigeria.\u201d One of such \u2018loot\u2019, according to the Chairman is the \u201calmost $7bn bailout fund that the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) granted 14 commercial banks between 2006-2008. Obono-Obla also confirmed that \u201cafter 13 years, these banks have not returned the money to government\u2019s treasury.\u201d Curiously, however, according to Obono-Obla \u201cwhen we enquired from CBN, the state of that money, the banks told us that the money was \u2018dashed\u2019 to them.\u201d It is not clear, why the Presidential Panel made its inquiry to CBN, but instead got a response from the banks; nevertheless, Obono-Obla rightly reiterated, that the $7bn, belonged to \u201cNigerians and so could not be given away, for free to commercial banks, owned by private individuals.\u201d Indeed, in exchange for their bloated bad debts, which were often poorly collateralized, over N5tn was also eased into the banking sector to bailout distressed banks in 2009. Notably, however, there has been no evidence of any refund whatsoever, of the $7bn, which CBN Governor, Soludo seemingly \u2018dashed\u2019 14 banks after they raised the mandatory N25bn capital base in 2006; ironically, nonetheless, government has since borrowed trillions of Naira, and paid double-digit interest rates to the same banks with whom CBN had placed $7bn \u2018Awoof\u2019 Credit. The above title was first published in October 2006, after, former CBN Governor, Soludo, embarked on a bizarre escapade, which is, arguably, a scam of Nigeria\u2019s Treasury. A summary of that article follows hereafter. Please read on. \u201cThe report that 14 Nigerian banks were appointed as Asset Managers of Nigeria\u2019s reserves was published in The Guardian Newspaper of October 5th, 2006. CBN Spokesperson, Festus Odoko, also confirmed that \u201calready, $7bn deposit representing, part of CBN\u2019s present share of foreign reserves, estimated at about $38bn, had been released to bankers.\u201d \u201cConsequently, CBN made good its promise to invite Nigerian banks, with a consolidated $500m capital base to a \u201cforeign reserves banquet\u201d, if they provided evidence of collaborative agreements with credible international financial houses. However, it is not clear whether or not the M.O.U. between the 14 Nigerian banks and their respective International affiliates, involves the adoption of global best banking practice and ethical standards with, collateral responsibility for financial integrity, or if the expected collaboration, is simply a glorified correspondence relationship! \u201cBut whose interest is CBN serving? Instructively, the disbursement of $7bn of public funds should not be treated with levity. Although, \u201cOdoko confirmed, in the Guardian report, that CBN\u2019s Investment Committee had ratified the appointment of the 14 banks for reserves management on Tuesday, October 3, 2016, curiously, however, the $7bn \u2018bounty\u2019 was also confirmed as already shared before Thursday morning, 5/10/06!\u201d \u201cNigerians may not appreciate, that with one stroke of the pen, CBN committed Nigeria to possibly its largest single investment ever! The question however, is whether or not the return from this \u2018huge investment\u2019 will stimulate productivity and employment opportunities, to improve our social welfare. If not, who will benefit from this biggest ever single investment paid, upfront by Nigerians? Yes, you have got it, the 14 banks who will, invariably, wear broad smiles to their overseas vaults! \u201cIncidentally, the 14 favoured banks, are free to invest anywhere in the world! Thus, while we go cap-in-hand for foreign loans to support Nigeria\u2019s economic development, we have simultaneously also, ironically exposed our hard earned $7bn forex, for either minimal or no gain, to a consortium of Nigerian banks, which presently have a consolidated capital base of less than $3bn, without asking for some measure of audit control or equity participation. \u201cNigerian banks still do not find it attractive to lend to the real sector, particularly the income and employment generating SMEs; consequently, it would be foolhardy to expect that a $7bn largesse, would change the attitude of banks in Nigeria\u2019s economy. The bizarre strategy of harvesting minimal returns below 3.5% on a $7bn sovereign loan, without time limit, is starkly amplified by CBN\u2019s willingness, to conversely pay interest rates between 12-17% for the funds it borrows from banks! \u201cIndeed, if the 14 banks are free to repatriate all or part of the $7bn back to the Nigerian capital market, the obvious domestic investment destination would be further patronage of government\u2019s treasury bills and bonds where they would earn up to 17% return, when government borrows from banks! \u201cUnfortunately, however, the trillions of Naira, CBN borrows with Treasury bill sales are regrettably not tied to any specific infrastructural project, but are inexplicably, simply kept sterilized in CBN vaults to restrain inflation. \u201cCBN\u2019s mouthpiece, Festus Odoko, also confirmed, in the Guardian report under reference, that \u201cthe $7bn represents CBN\u2019s share of foreign reserves!\u2019 I beg your pardon! What work did CBN do to earn $7bn? Furthermore, the Constitution does not allocate a portion of dollar reserves to CBN; invariably, crude oil earnings, clearly belong to the Nigerian people, as defined by the three tiers of government; thus, the National Assembly, would have defaulted in their constitutional role, if CBN is not invited to defend why $7bn of our reserves should be \u2018given\u2019 to 14 banks without any return or oversight approval!\u201d The above title was first published in October 2006. Not surprisingly, however, by 2009, three years after Soludo\u2019s \u2018celebrated\u2019 banking consolidation, most Nigerian banks tittered on the verge of collapse. The 14 favoured banks, apparently, never repaid the $7bn advanced before the banking crisis; consequently, Nigeria\u2019s $7bn may have ultimately \u2018gone with the wind\u2019 during the ensuing financial meltdown in 2009! Nonetheless, such probable default did not stop banks from receiving additional largesse, above N5tn ($30bn), from the lifelines extended through CBN and AMCON interventions between 2009-2010! Notwithstanding CBN\u2019s misguided generosity, banks have clearly failed to service the real sector with cheap, loanable funds, which would stimulate industrial rejuvenation, economic growth and increasing job opportunities. Consequently, EFCC should closely examine the circumstances and the ultimate fate of CBN\u2019s extraordinary package of $7bn to banks in 2006. POSTSCRIPT SEPTEMBER 2018: Curiously, despite Obono-Obla\u2019s recent bombshell in September 2018, Press/Media/Public reactions against this brazen pen robbery has been unexpectedly very lukewarm. Incidentally, however, on our behest, about 5 years ago, learned silk, Femi Falana and Associates, approached CBN on the platform of the Freedom of Information Act, for confirmation of whether or not the 14 Banks had liquidated CBN\u2019s \u2018unusual credit\u2019 of $7bn to privately owned banks. Regrettably, however, CBN till this day, ignored the FOI request. Related",

        "title": "14 NIGERIAN BANKS TO ENJOY $7BN RESERVE",
        "author": "Les Leba",
        "text": "By Les Leba Nigerians may rightly feel shortchanged by the shenanigans in the banking sub sector in the last two years or so. In the wake of the global meltdown, the eloquent Professor at the helm of our Central Bank assured Nigerians, including the Federal Legislature, over and over again that Nigerian banks were insulated from the global crisis as a result of astute regulation of the commercial banks and adoption of best practices in monetary policy and management. Alas, only a few months after these soothing assurances, the patches of the incoherent structure gave way and the edifice came tumbling down with revelations of all manner of fraud spanning the gamut of unbridled margin loans, deliberate equity price manipulations, unsecured loans and the diversion of depositors\u2019 funds into the personal accounts of bank directors. The appointment of Lamido sanusi in mid 2009 as the new CBN helmsman further exposed the putrid malfeasance in the banking sub-sector. At least, five banks were initially reported to be almost fatally distressed, but in reality, almost all the registered commercial banks in the country were tainted in one way or the other. In the aftermath of these revelations, Sanusi \u2018created\u2019 N 620 bn as Governor to bridge severe haemorrhaging in Oceanic Bank, Intercontinental Bank, Afri Bank, Finbank and Union Bank, after the respective Chief Operating Officers had been given the boot!! Initially, CBN suggested that the bad loans in the banking sub-sector approached N 1.2 trillion, but this figure has since witnessed several upward reviews and in spite of the forced recovery of over N 500 billion with the cooperation of the EFCC and the recent retrieval of assets estimated at about N 190 bn from erstwhile Oceanic Bank G.M.D., inexplicably the value of toxic loans that the hurriedly contrived Asset Management Company AMMCO is expected to absorb has leaped to N3 trillion!! Some cynics would say that in this matter of toxic assets, it is a case of the more you look the less you see!! CBN\u2019s assurances of the positive economic impact of the 25 consolidated banks have all become tales by moonlight! Our best ever foreign reserve base of over $60 billion has also since been frittered away leaving a paltry $ 34 billion, which presumably consists of \u2018core reserves\u2019 as well as undeclared billions of dollars for which CBN had substituted naira when disbursing monthly allocations to the three tiers of government! It is not clear if this balance includes the $ 7 billion that Soludo gave to 14 Nigerian banks to manage as reward for increasing their capital base beyond N 25 million in 2006!! Indeed, it is not also clear whether the $ 7 billion (about N1.05 trillion) is also part of the toxic debts value of N 3 trillion in which case CBN\u2019s bailout package to the same debtor banks with additional public funds may best be seen as the ultimate in \u2018worst\u2019 Central Banking\u2019 practices! In other words, our CBN will be putting more money in the pockets of our debtors so that they can pay same to us as loan redemption!! The following article titled \u201c14 NIGERIAN BANKS TO ENJOY $7 Billion DOLLAR RESERVES\u201d was first published on 9/10/2006. It was our hope and expectation that the government would take more than a casual look at CBN\u2019s monetary and banking management; regrettably, this was not to be. Indeed, the current Governor has persisted with the same monetary framework that encouraged the depletion of our reserves and simultaneously increased our debt profile. If for example, the CBN can recover the $7 billion from the 14 Nigerian banks(amongst which are distressed banks like Oceanic, ICMB, Union and Bank PHB) then, there may be no need for processing the new loan request of about $500 million from international capital market. Please read on. \u201cThe report of the 14 Nigerian banks which had been appointed as Asset Managers of Nigeria\u2019s reserves was carried on the back page of The Guardian Newspaper of last Thursday 5/10/06. The report confirmed that \u201calready deposits worth $7 billion representing the apex bank\u2019s share of the foreign reserves estimated at about $ 38 billion has been released to the consortium of bankers according to CBN Head of Corporate Affairs, Mr. Festus Odoko\u201d. \u201cIn this event, CBN had made good its promise to allow Nigerian banks which have up to $500 million capital base to be invited to the foreign reserves banquet if they could show evidence of collaboration with internationally recognised financial houses. The Guardian report quoted above indicated that all the 14 Nigerian banks have associated with reputable institutions. The report is, however, not clear whether or not the M.O.U. between both parties involves a joint responsibility for profits and loss or simply collaboration as glorified banking correspondents. The difference is that if the international financial houses are joint stock partners with the Nigerian bankers, they would automatically show interest in the transparent and profitable management of the reserves. If on the other hand they are glorified correspondent partners, they could provide technical support and advice on transparent, secure and profitable ventures, but the Nigerian banks do not have to heed their advice or professional direction! In this manner the whole purpose of technical collaboration may not exceed using the facilities of their international partners to facilitate cross_ border transactions! \u201cThe CBN had earlier demanded that only Nigerian banks which had a capital base of $500 million (i.e. about N60bn) would be allowed to participate in the reserves management, but it now appears that CBN may have quietly dropped this requirement so as to pursue its declared agenda! \u201cBut wait a minute, whose interest is the CBN serving? The sum of $7 billion is a huge sum of money in any currency and when the money is the property of 150 million people, it would be expected that the disbursement is not treated with levity. Although in the Guardian report \u201cMr. Odoko explained that the appointment of the 14 banks was ratified by the Investment Committee of CBN on Tuesday, 3/10/06, and the deposits worth $7 billion had already been shared by Thursday morning, 5/10/06. \u201cNigerians may not realise that with one stroke of the pen, CBN has committed Nigeria to possibly its largest single investment ever! The questions that need to be asked are: what do we hope to get from this huge investment in terms of returns of a better life and improved welfare for our people? Would the $7 billion investment improve the power generating capacity so that industries, commercial outlets and private homes, can enjoy cheap and sustainable power supply? The answer is no. Will this investment bring potable water to more Nigerians so that our national hygiene standards can improve and water borne and related diseases which afflict the majority of our people be reduced? Again, the answer is no! Will our hospitals and schools which suffer severe deprivations be resuscitated and replenished? The answer is no! Will our mass transit systems improve in the face of the untold suffering of our people to and from their workplaces everyday? Again, the answer is No! Will the investment of $7 billionn enable Nigeria to inch nearer to the United Nations Millennium Development Goals for poor countries? Again, the answer is No! \u201cSo, who will benefit from this biggest ever single investment paid upfront by the Nigerian nation? Yes, you have got it, the 14 banks which will wear broad smiles to their overseas vaults! The CBN has not yet declared what returns it would demand from the 14 fattened banks. The parameter of rate of return on investment is the universal measure of the profitability or attractiveness of an investment. It is unlikely that CBN will get more than 3 per cent interest per annum on its $7 billionn; i.e. less than $220 million profit after deduction of the usual array of management and banking charges which are peculiar to the Nigerian banking industry. \u201cPresumably, the 14 favoured banks are not constrained to channel lending back to the Nigerian economy, as they would be free to invest anywhere in the world. Thus, while we are pleading with foreign investors to come to Nigeria to help economic and industrial development, we are exposing our hard earned foreign exchange of $7 billion to a consortium of Nigerian banks which have a capital base of less than $3 billion without asking for some measure of audit control or equity participation. \u201cNigerian banks have found it unattractive to invest in the real sector, particularly the income and employment generating SMEs; so, it would be foolhardy to expect that the largesse of $ 7 billion low interest loan would change their attitude to the Nigeria economy. The bizarre posturing of CBN with regard to the rate of return expected by Nigerians for a $ 7 billion investment without a time limit is amplified by its willingness to pay interest rates of 12 and 17 per cent for monies it borrows from the domestic capital market (mainly same indebted banks) in Nigeria. The CBN Governor lamented the other day that over N 75 billion (the value of the capital base of three Nigerian mega banks) had been spent by government in servicing its indebtedness for such instruments for the first half of 2006 alone! Presumably, Nigerians will pay holders of government bills and bonds another N 75 billion before the year runs out! (Debt service for 2010 is over N500bn!!) \u201cIndeed, in the event that the 14 banks are free to repatriate all or part of the $ 7 billion back to the Nigerian capital market, it is not difficult to predict where their interests would lie: you have got it! Further patronage of government\u2019s treasury bills and bonds where they can earn rates of return of up to 17 per cent on loans to the government! Never mind that the monies which will be repatriated by the 14 banks for these investments will be part or all of the loan of $ 7 billion which Nigerians had deposited in their overseas accounts! Worse still, money so collected for sale of government bills and bonds are not tied to any specific infrastructural project but just kept idle in CBN vaults. \u201cMr. Odoko, the CBN mouthpiece had indicated in the Guardian report quoted above that \u201cthe $7bn represents the apex bank\u2019s share of the foreign reserves!\u2019 I beg your pardon! What work did CBN do to earn $7bn? The Constitution does not define a share of reserves for the CBN; our crude oil earnings belong to the Nigerian people as expressed by the three tiers of government; the Senate and the House of Representatives would have defaulted in their constitutional duties if CBN is not invited to defend why $7bn of our reserves should be \u2018dashed\u2019 to 14 banks! \u201cThe CBN Investment Committee must also be summoned to acquaint the Federal Legislature with the parameters adopted for managing Nigeria\u2019s external reserves!\u201d SAVE THE NAIRA, SAVE NIGERIANS!

        "author": "Nwabueze Okonkwo",
        "text": "By Nwabueze Okonkwo ONITSHA \u2014 When General Ibrahim Babangida\u2019s military regime flagged off a contract for the construction of a gigantic water scheme at Amuro Community in Okigwe Local Government Area of Imo state, at the cost of $36 million US Dollars, under the control of Anambra-Imo River Basin Development Authority, Naze, Owerri, both indigenes and non indigenes of the area shedded tears of joy that they would soon fetch water from the facility at their door steps. But alas! the dream was shattered as even after more millions of naira was sunk into the project, after Babangida administration\u2019s exit and till date, there is nothing to show for it. Like an Igbo adage which says that a dog does not eat a bone hung in its neck, some hoodlums suspected to be working under government parastatals, out of criminal and selfish intention, allegedly vandalized all the installations, set it ablaze and ensured that the project could not be completed. According to reliable sources, Nigeria has over 200 hydro projects spread across the nation yet non of them could generate and supply uninterrupted electricity. This is as a result of the alleged rampant vandalization of government installations by the same government officials. According to a community source, during the regime of Chief Olusegun Obasanjo, the aggrieved host community petitioned him, demanding that the project should be completed and made to become operational and consequently, Obasanjo doled out another N850 million, outside the $36 million Dollars originally mapped out for the project, for the installation of Hydro-electric components of the water scheme for water reticulation. Again, the contractors allegedly repainted the water basin, used water tankers to fill up the concrete basin with water from Imo River and invited Obasanjo to commission the project at about 8.15 p.m. After the commissioning ceremony, Obasanjo, at the last days of his tenure, suspected that the contractors might have fooled him and directed the then minister of Water Resources to go and find out the true position and on arrival, the Minister was said to have discovered to his chagrin that the concrete basin was not only empty, but non functional. Further more, the host community petitioned President Yar\u2019Adua who doled out another N650 million to complete the project but unfortunately, the fund went into the grave with Yar\u2019Adua from where it was drained through the conduit pipe. The community disclosed that in 2015, Prince Christopher Muo, son of Eze Muonago of Amuro petitioned the federal government on behalf of the community and even made representations to Senator Ike Ekweremadu, the Deputy Senate President and intimated him of what they termed as systematic criminal stripping of the water scheme by officials of Imo State Water Corporation and the Imo State Water Board which have management authority over the Amuro water scheme. The community confirmed that up till date, the water scheme could not be completed after all the monies sunk into it by the federal government, because of the criminal activities of the contractors in collaboration with the officials of Imo state water board, accusing some fraudulent state water board officials of sending some vandals who from time to time, had exchange of gun fire with the community vigilante operatives, shortly after leading the delegation to Ekweremadu. According to Prince Muo, it is regrettable that top government functionaries sponsor and fund vandalization of national infrastructures such as the Amuro water scheme, adding that in most cases, the police are fingered at aiding armed vandals who are apprehended after a gun duel to escape criminal justice sanction. Muo contended that on April 23, 2015, Solomon Biere Ndukwe, the Amuro community security operative whose statement indicted tin gods at the Imo State Water Board died under questionable circumstances, adding that not yet done with the series of vandalization, arsonists suspected to have been sent by the same government officials, set the administrative block of the water installation ablaze on December 24, 2015 and ever since then, the police investigation has been swept under the carpet with administrative silence. Muo stated that it was more worrisome that the report of the federal fire service on the December 24, 2015 fire disaster at the administrative block of the water scheme showed that the fire was ignited when some Amuro indigenes went into the premises to hunt for bush rats, adding that it is ironic that the community which does not eat bush rats as a matter of tradition are being falsely accused of hunting for the rants to the extent of setting the valuable water scheme ablaze. Muo therefore appealed to the Minister of Interior, General Abdulrahman Dambazzau to publish federal fire service department investigation report of Amuro Okigwe water works fire disaster of December 24, 2015, so as to trigger of thorough investigations by the appropriate authorities because those involved in the arson and vandalization are bent on concealing their atrocities which resulted in rendering the multi-billion naira water scheme non functional. He also called on the Inspector-General of Police, IGP to publish the police investigation report on the whereabout of three sets of vandals who the community vigilante operatives apprehended, handed over to policemen at the Divisional Police Headquarters, Okigwe but who had disappeared after being granted bail by the Okigwe police Division. He further called on the federal government to come and complete the project, despite of all odds, particularly now that the project consultant and presently the vice-chairman of Powtech Group Limited, Abuja, Goddy Duru-Oguzie has accepted to work with the federal ministry of water resources and any other contractor the ministry will engage to resuscitate the project.

        "text": "By Bunmi Sofola a) Always look on the dark side of life. See the glass as half empty rather than full, regard changing circumstances as disasters rather than opportunities, always expect things to go wrong, and your negativity will remain intact. (b) Repress your anger. Become accustomed to feeling as if you\u2019re about to explode with rage, get used to a racing heart and a throbbing head, ignore the increased risk of heart disease, depression and \u2013 as people start to avoid you \u2013 unstable relationships. (c) Be unreliable. Ensure that people never expects anything of you by forgetting birthdays, turning up late and never completing tasks. (d) Catch the news again and again. Maintain high levels of misery and \u201cwhat\u2019s the world coming to?\u201d syndrome by becoming a news addict, reading the papers first thing and topping up with bulletins throughout the day. (e) Become a couch potato. Reject the overwhelming evidence that regular exercise is good for your body and emotional well-being, use the car, avoid the gym and slouch on the sofa instead. Add a few high-fat snacks while relaxing and you\u2019ll soon feel too tired and heavy even to think about a healthier routine. (f) Stay home alone. Give up your social life and you\u2019ll never have to meet those annoyingly happy types who remind you that you\u2019re missing out. (g) Neglect your appearance. Keep your low self-esteem intact by not bothering to wash, apply make-up, or do your hair. (h) Hit the bottle. Drink too much alcohol, refusing to accept that it\u2019s disrupting your sleep patterns, affecting your work performance, depriving you of nutrients, reducing your bank balance and causing arguments with loved ones. (i) Play the victim. Convince yourself that your problems are caused by other people, and that you have no hope of changing your life. (j) Be a stick-in-the-mud. Remain safe and unchallenged by adhering to the same routine and carefully avoiding anything new and different. (k) Ignore aches and pains, soldier on regardless of an aching back or stomach pains in the hope that they\u2019ll go away, ignoring the fact that you may be making any problem worse by not seeing a doctor. (1) Shop till you drop. Spending more than you earn keeps your credit \u2013 card company and your bank manager happy. While guaranteeing those familiar monthly headaches as you attempt to juggle finances. (m) See people as potential enemies. Be suspicious of everyone, sticking to your belief that people are always out to get you. This way, you don\u2019t have to worry about making any new friends, dating or finding a new job. (n) Reveal nothing. Assure high levels of feeling put upon and misunderstood, by not saying what you really mean or feel \u2013 also a great way to drive people away and ensure your continued isolation. (o) Focus on what you don\u2019t have. Convince yourself that everyone else has more by focusing on their wonderful house. Related",

        "author": "Henry Boyo",
        "text": "By Henry Boyo Tomorrow, August 22, 2017, will make 15 years, since the advocacy, ceaselessly canvassed in this column, for a payments reform, that would regenerate and rapidly propel inclusive economic growth, was presented to government. Incidentally, in earlier, casual discussion of such proposal, at an \u2018Old School Boys\u2019 meeting, unexpectedly, led to an invitation to make a presentation to the National Economic Intelligence Committee (NEIC) with Prof Ibrahim Ayagi as Chairman. Despite the short notice, a paper titled \u201cA LIBERALIZED FOREIGN EXCHANGE MARKET AND ITS ECONOMIC BENEFITS\u201d, was co-authored with a colleague, Adaighofua Ojomaikre a kindred spirit on this matter, and the solution proffered, in that paper, was later discussed during our visit to NEIC\u2019s Abuja office on the August 22, 2002. Naira In retrospect, the NEIC team seemed in accord with our analysis that the subsisting, primitive, payment model, adopted by government was the primary cause of our weak economy, even when foreign exchange revenue was increasingly more bountiful. Nonetheless, Ayagi personally wondered, if the solution prescribed in our paper was in current application in any country. The NEIC team, was obviously startled, by the response, that no successful economy, that we know, consciously captures export revenue, as our government presently does, and then proceeds to create an estimated local currency equivalent as replacement for such revenue before sharing and spending, and then embarks on auctioning their forex booty in a market already suffocated with excess Naira liquidity. Ultimately, Professor Ayagi agreed that the committee would consider our paper in future discussions with, incumbent President Olusegun Obasanjo. Regrettably, there was no feedback thereafter from NEIC, after this encounter. Consequently, in an attempt to spur the Agency into action, additional copies of the same paper were printed and sent directly by courier, with a cover letter in October 2002, to President Obasanjo and some critical cabinet members, including the Finance minister, Okonjo Iweala, the Education minister, the Secretary to Government and Joseph Sanusi, incumbent Central bank governor, amongst others were also copied. Regrettably, there was equally no response from the president\u2019s office, so our letter dated March 8, 2003 to NEIC drew attention to CBN\u2019S recently published \u201c2002 Macro Economic Review\u201d which indicated that \u201cthe year recorded, continued excessive growth in monetary aggregates, relative to set targets\u201d. The same letter of the 8th of March also observed that \u201cthe various, unfavourable economic indicators merely represent symptoms and complications of an already correctly diagnosed disease, namely excess liquidity.\u201d We also noted that, \u201cit has been amply shown that excess liquidity in Nigeria today, is self-inflicted, as it is traceable to the faulty translation of hard currency revenue into the domestic economy\u201d. We therefore affirmed that\u201d no serious country, abuses and debases its currency in that manner.\u201d In view of experience, NEIC\u2019s prompt response to our letter of March 8, clearly came as a surprise; an excerpt dated 25/3/02 from the rather terse response is as follows: \u201cThe National Economic Intelligence Committee (NEIC) acknowledges, receipt of your letter dated 8thMarch, 2003, on the above subject matter (i.e. liberalisation of the forex market). The NEIC notes that you have already contacted Mr. President and the Governor of the Central Bank on the same subject matter. This development forecloses further consideration of your proposal, by the committee, until Mr. President concludes his consultation on the matter.\u201d Curiously, there was no acknowledgement, or response whatsoever, from any member of the federal executive to whom we also couriered the report. Nonetheless, CBN\u2019s Director of Research O.J Nnana (Ph.D) sent a long winding response; part of the conclusion in Nnana\u2019s letter dated November 29, 2002 reads as follows: \u201cWe are, however, very skeptical on the level of trust that you put on the various tiers of governments regarding your proposal to fund their accounts in foreign exchange under your proposed \u201cwarrant system\u201d. We hope it would not be another source of capital flight and a free run on the external reserves and the naira exchange rate.\u201d \u201cMy colleague, Ojomaikre and I, refused to be deterred by the disappointing lack of interest from a government team , that seemed so self assured in their capacity to properly manage the economy, even when the critical indices of inflation, cost of funds, exchange rate stability and unemployment rates were clearly out of sync with tested models for sustained, inclusive economic growth anywhere. We consequently, proceeded to Channels Television in Ikeja, where we asked to speak to anyone, with whom we could discuss our recommendation for a progressive payment reform, that would revitalize and transform Nigeria\u2019s economy. Unexpectedly, barely three days thereafter, the TV station invited this writer to elaborate on some aspects of our paper, which had resonated in that day\u2019s news bulletin. Curiously, despite the frequency of alternate media invitations that followed thereafter, the CBN, who is invariably the acknowledged villain, in the disruptive and disenabling payment system, that has continued to impoverish us, kept mute. However, in November 2004, I was invited to the Vanguard newspaper office in Kirkiri; It was, certainly my first meeting with veteran journalist and publisher Mr. Sam Amuka, a.k.a uncle Sam, who offered a lunch treat in the staff canteen, before requesting that I should write on those issues that he had seen and heard me discuss passionately in several media. I, of course, thought he meant a one-off article, but he insisted, despite my protest, that I do not have the tenacity and discipline of a regular columnist, that he actually expected a weekly column. I was probably flattered by what I felt was blind faith in my ability, but Uncle Sam seemed so sure, I could do it; besides, he was also very charming in asking, and it became difficult to refuse. I assured him, later that afternoon, that I would try, and my first article in the RATIONAL PERSPECTIVES column was published in vanguard newspaper 22nd November 2004, the Daily Independent and Punch Newspapers also joined in syndicating the column in 2005 and January 2012 respectively. Regrettably, inspite of over 700 articles in the print media, with hundreds of interviews in both print and electronic media, since 2002, government and its economic team have remained resistant to our call for progressive economic change while excess liquidity remains prominently unyielding; invariably, inflation has sadly climbed from 13% in 2002 to over 16% today, while cost of funds to business is well above 20%; meanwhile, the Naira is comatose, with youth unemployment rate exceeding 25%! Will they ever learn? Nonetheless, it would be a disservice to Nigeria and Africa to halt the advocacy for CBN to release its stranglehold monopoly on the foreign exchange market.

        "text": "By Josephine Agbonkhese In a bid to address the lack of access to basic services which has long been identified as a major challenge facing orphans and vulnerable children (OVCs) in the country, the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) has partnered the Association for Reproductive and Family Health (ARFH) on a five-year project that would benefit 151,271 OVCs and 30,254 families in three states, including Lagos State. Disadvantaged children Tagged \u2018Local Partners for Orphans and Vulnerable Children\u2019- LOPIN 1, the five-year project is specifically focused on enhancing accelerated and sustainable access to basic services such as education, health, nutrition, psychosocial, legal and social protection for OVCs. Concurrently, their families will also benefit economic empowerment interventions to enable them effectively perform their roles as primary providers for their children/wards. Accordingly, through the ARFH/LOPIN 1 project designed to model inclusiveness in programming for OVCs in accordance with the National Priority Agenda, the USAID recently provided stakeholders in Lagos State (community based organizations, LGAs and state government) with computer sets and accessories that would enhance timely and accurate coverage of the services to be provided to OVCs and their families. The project goal, according to Director of Programs, ARFH/LOPIN1 Project, Mr Ogunmodede Matthew Rotimi, \u201cis to mitigate the impact of HIV/AIDS on children and their families in Lagos State with the objective of improving the systems and structures at community, LGAs and state levels in providing responsive care, protection and support services. We are also replicating this in two other states in the country. \u201cOther objectives include to improve organizational and technical capacity of local Nigerian partners to offer services to OVCs and their families, and to facilitate local Nigerian CBO partners to engage more effectively with LGA and private sector partners.\u201d The LOPIN 1 project is said to be partnering the Lagos State government through the Ministries of Women Affairs and Poverty Alleviation, Education, Health, Budget and Planning and Agriculture, with geographical coverage spanning across five LGAs namely: Agege, Badagry, Ajeromi, Kosofe and Ojo.

        "author": "Sonny Atumah",
        "text": "By Sonny Atumah It appears the proposed Nigeria US$15 billion facility from India may be a loansharking. The loan would be repaid with long term contract to supply crude oil to Indian Public Sector Undertakings, PSU (government owned corporations) that are mostly engaged in refining of petroleum products and in petrochemicals. The deal may also be in refining, executing City Gas Distribution, CGD, and Liquefied Petroleum Gas, LPG infrastructure projects by Indian PSUs. The Minister of State for Petroleum Resources, Dr. Ibe Kachikwu with his Indian counterpart in charge of Petroleum and Natural Gas, Shri Dharmendra Pradhan are putting thoughts on paper in a memorandum of understanding, MOU to be firmed up at the PETROTECH 2016, the 12th biennial International Oil and Gas Conference and Exhibition at the Vigyan Bhavan in the Indian National Capital Territory, Delhi from December 5-7, 2016. Kachikwu had gone to India last October to solicit for assistance for our ailing petroleum industry. Earlier in the year he gave the impression that about US$700 million would rehabilitate the our refineries to maximize their outputs. Indeed we need investments and collaborations in the downstream and upstream sectors, but not with a humongous US$15 billion loan from India. Experts express doubts that a corporation with low records of transparency and accountability would effectively manage funds of that magnitude. The NNPC owes Joint Venture partners billions of dollars in cash calls. Since July 2014, the international crude oil market had been glutted; with government hardly able to meet fiscal provisions including the 2016 budget. By the third quarter, Q3 of 2016, Nigeria\u2019s economy went into recession. The Federal Government is also seeking external borrowing of $29.96 billion, which request is awaiting the approval of the National Assembly. It is not clear whether the US$15 billion is part of the President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s loan as there was no item of petroleum infrastructure listed in the request. Observers believe the proposed US$15 billion loan for crude oil exchange is vague in specifics, so the devil may be in the details. Nigerians deserve to know the jumbo loan schedule. With very low domestic savings the Federal Government is borrowing externally to stimulate the economy. The issue of external borrowing may have a positive relationship with GDP in the short run but if not well managed a negative relationship may result in the long run. Nigeria generates 95 percent export revenue, 85 percent public revenue and 14 percent gross domestic product, GDP contributions from oil. Our external debt to GDP ratio is 12.24 percent. Debt service to revenue ratio is 35 percent. With Revenue to DGP ratio of 6 percent we may indeed have a management problem because it is less than the acceptable level of about 18 percent. But do we have the capacity to effectively manage funds of this magnitude? Experts believe the government should exercise restraint to avoid the 1985-2004 period where our external earnings were grossly spent on repayment and servicing of US$35.945 billion debt to multilateral agencies, Paris and London Clubs etc., until the debt forgiveness in 2006. And that may defeat government\u2019s intention for growth and development. From the Debt Management Office, DMO Nigeria\u2019s external debt stock by June 2016 is US$11.261 billion. The loan from India for long term crude oil contract may turn out to be an expensive venture; our bargain is not on cash on the barrelhead. There is no reciprocal relationship on the very many byproducts and derivatives, being a crude term contract. If loan acquisition is inevitable Nigeria should have a clear-cut business and investment policy parade with all indices to match Indian adventure capitalists. In June 2016, the Minister of State led Nigerian officials to China to woo investors in the downstream sector. The Chinese Department of International Cooperation, DIC of the National Reform and Development Commission, NDRC was made to fashion a blue print for would be investors and develop an overarching master plan for Nigerian oil and gas. The Chinese were to provide detailed feasibility studies of current status of the existing infrastructure in the Nigerian industry and develop bankable projects that would attract Chinese investors on the government-to-government platform. We were in a disadvantaged position for negotiation; assumptions were that the NNPC lacks technical and managerial competences. Since the United States dumped our crude oil for the Azeri (Azerbaijan) oil in July 2014; it was belly flop that we crawled to India for rescue. Nigeria is India\u2019s largest trading partner (dominated by crude oil and gas imports) in Africa. The India government is a net importer of crude oil with the national oil companies operating 19 out of her 23 refineries. Out of the 14- member OPEC, Nigeria is the only one that her petroleum managers kill their refineries. They import petroleum products even from non-producing consumer nations, inflict pain on their citizens and pontificate about it. Ordinarily, we would have used refining and downstream activities to diversify the Nigeria economy along vertical linkages since we have comparative and competitive advantages in petroleum. Petroleum products including gasoline, kerosene, diesel, fuel oils, liquefied petroleum gas, lubricants, asphalts, naphtha, paraffin wax, plastics, fertilizers\u2019, pesticides, coke, bunker oils etc. are imported. The profitability of base petrochemicals either from olefins (ethylene, propylene and butadiene) or aromatics (benzene, toluene and xylene) cannot be quantified. Refineries and petrochemical plants are required for strategic reasons including economic, political and security. Doing so means reaping value additions for energy, technology and skills. With local refining we have up to 6000 by-products and derivatives, diversify the economy along vertical linkages, create wealth, induce savings and investments, increase GDP(nominal or purchasing power parity), increase fiscal revenue, and soak up unemployment in our army of youth that are becoming restive. The diversification experience of a few successful oil exporters suggests that diversification usually takes place amid dwindling oil revenues. Successful strategies have relied on a policy mix of promoting vertical diversification in comparative advantage sectors such as oil and gas and petrochemicals and endeavours into horizontal diversification beyond these sectors with an emphasis on technological upgrade and competition in international markets \u2013 IMF. We spend tens of billions of dollars importing petroleum products, petrochemicals and petroleum-based raw materials annually from net importers of petroleum. India as a net importer of crude and the world\u2019s third largest energy consumer still subsidises energy. The IMF\u2019s 2015 country profile places India\u2019s post tax subsidies on petroleum at US$72.19 billion, and on natural gas at US$9.29 billion. In India foreign oil companies are only allowed to market products refined by Oil Corporations and companies. Our main conversation with the Indians that import crude and refine should be on technical collaborations, far and above pedestrian levels of crude oil sales to obtain loans. Related",

        "author": "Owei Lakemfa",
        "text": "By Owei Lakemfa IT was the familiar, but unpalatable news from the United States,US. The unfolding horror, was not Hollywood, but an American reality; a gunman is holed up with hostages whom he is busy eliminating. This was June 12, 2016, and 29-year old American, Omar Seddique Mateen murdered a record 49 persons and injured 53 within three hours of entering the Pulse, an Orlando gay nightclub. The issue is not about the venue; it might well have been a school, church, mosque, synagogue or theatre. Omar Seddique Mateen The mix this time was homosexuals, terrorism, religion and guns. Some other times, it was children, school, and guns. Other times it was a movie theatre, array of lives and guns. Whatever the mix, motive or venue, the gun is a common denominator it is that recurrent decimal, God\u2019s Own Country seems unable or unwilling to do something about. The Orlando massacre was the sixteenth in the eight-year Presidency of Barack Obama, one of the most resourceful, intelligent and compassionate American Presidents in history. Before Obama, America already had a culture of massacres such as the April 16, 2007 murder of 32 persons in the Virginia Tech University. The ones under Obama began with the Friday, April 3, 2009 murder of 32 persons at the Citizenship class in Binghamton, New York. Perhaps, the most heart-rending was December, 2012 when 20 children aged between 5-10 years were gunned down, in addition to six adults at the Sandy Hook Elementary School. But the bloodiest period was in 2015 when six massacres were recorded; an average of one massacre every sixty days. Tired of repeating himself and addressing the country so frequently on the same issue, a hapless Obama after the October, 2015 Oregon Massacre told his fellow Americans: \u201d Each time this happens I am going to say that we can actually do something about it, but we\u2019re going to have to change our laws. And this is not something I can do by myself. I\u2019ve got to have a Congress and I\u2019ve got to have state legislatures and governors who are willing to work with me on this. I hope and pray that I don\u2019t have to come out again during my tenure as President to offer my condolences to families in these circumstances. But based on my experience as President, I can\u2019t guarantee that.\u201d Perhaps, if the laws Obama talked about had been in place, the Orlando massacre might not have taken place because the shooter, Mateen who had been placed on the FBI terrorist watch list for ten months and investigated twice by the agency, would have been ineligible to buy the guns including the assault rifle, he used. In December, 2015, a bill that would have prevented a person like Mateen purchasing guns was defeated by 54-45 votes. The reason for the defeat is not necessarily because of the gun culture in the country or the December 15, 1791 Second Amendment of the American Constitution. In any case, the Supreme Court had in the United States v. Cruikshank ruled in 1876 that \u201cThe right to bear arms is not granted by the Constitution; neither is it in any manner dependent upon that instrument for its existence\u201d and also in 1939 in United States v. Miller, ruled that the right does not prohibit regulation of firearms by the Federal Government and the states if it is not related to a \u201creasonable relationship to the preservation or efficiency of a well regulated militia.\u201d The defeat is primarily due to the huge profit in gun production and sales. Outside the mighty American military and security forces, there were 242 million privately owned guns in 2009 when Obama assumed office. In 2013, the American population was 317 million while the number of guns in private hands was 357 million; that is 40 million more guns than the populace. By 2009, the American gun-makers were producing 5.6 million guns annually, and in 2013, 10.9 million guns. It is therefore the aroma of the dollar that prevails, rather than common sense and the need to protect innocent Americans. This was reflected in the responses to the Orlando shootings. For instance, President Obama noted that \u201cthe shooter was apparently armed with a hand gun and a powerful assault rifle. This massacre is, therefore, a further reminder of how easy it is for someone to get their hands on a weapon that lets them shoot people in a school, or in a house of worship, or a movie theater, or in a nightclub. We have to decide if that\u2019s the kind of country we want to be.\u201d However, the reaction of the presumptive Republican candidate, Donald Trump, was in line with the illogical argument that the solution to gun violence is more guns. He said . \u2018If we had people, where the bullets were going in the opposite direction\u2026 And this son of a b**** comes out and starts shooting, and one of the people in that room happened to have (a gun) and goes boom, boom (shoots the attacker)\u2026 You know what? That would have been a beautiful, beautiful sight, folks.\u201d Trump added \u201cPresident Obama is trying to make terrorism into guns and it\u2019s not guns, folks. It is not guns, folks. It is not guns, this is terrorism.\u201d As expected, the American National Rifle Association,NRA, argued that guns had nothing to do with the Orlando massacre. Chris W. Cox, the Executive Director of NRA\u2019s Institute for Legislative Action, the lobby and political arm of the association argued \u201crepeating the same thing but expecting a different result is the definition of insanity. Law-abiding gun owners are tired of being blamed for the acts of madmen and terrorists.\u201d It is not Obama or those who call for gun control that are insane as the NRA suggests, but those who price profit far above human lives including those of toddlers. It is only Americans who can save themselves from profiteers and make their country safe. As it is, the United States is a high risk country and an international travel alert for all those going to that country, will not be out of place. God bless America! Related",

        "text": "Because I believe and strongly too, that we are not doing enough to project our youth on world stage, I want to write this week on some events of last week that touched my sports heart. Before that, perhaps I will not be forgiven for running away from what has become known as the \u201cThe Ethiopian Misadventure\u201d. I do not think I have anything fresh to add to what my colleagues and sports commentators have said or written already on this topic other than to say we will qualify for Gabon\u2013Equatorial Guinea Nations Cup. That we have to go through this tortuous journey every time is what baffles me. Without going too far back, there is no doubt that we bungled preparations leading to that match and the unnecessary Argentina friendly played a big part just as we foresaw. I was in Tunis when Ade Ojeikere of the Nation posted me that result and I remember screaming that it \u201c\u2026was not good, not good at all.\u201d What gives me the confidence that we will qualify? Definitely it is not the belief that we will go to Madagascar and beat them or that we will pound Guinea when they arrive Abuja. Nothing, just natural instinct. Am I not a Nigerian? Here we get answers even when we do not solve equations! I confess however that when I got to Dakar, Senegal while transiting to Lagos an article in the Newspaper Sud Quotidien swayed my qualification thoughts. In it, the President of the Senegalese Football Federation Augustine Senghor, Mayor of Goree,(A lawyer ) argued that winning a football match was more than throwing eleven boys into the field to go and face the opposition. He spoke about the famous draw in Yaounde against the Indomitable Lions and how the players had to play the match with their heads rather than their legs. He said the players needed a refined mentality. That they were made to realize that they were stake holders in the business of qualification, they were told to imbibe a collective resolve, work for country and for each other, and carry the flag in and on their hearts. \u201c\u2026.. The boys rose to the occasion. Patriotism took centre stage. You did not know who was a defender and who was an attacker. They were ready to die to qualify. The mental response was incredible\u201d the Senegalese FA President said. There and then I took a long look at our squad and wondered whether we had those players, that attitude, that mentality, that resolve that will come to play when physical ability fails. Failure to find a comfortable response, I switched to another CAF qualification clause that says: \u201cThe following teams will be qualified for the final phase of the 2012 ACN : \u2013 The first team of each group. \u2013 The second team of the Group where Togo belongs. \u2013 The two best second teams of ten other groups. The two best second teams of the group of four will be determine by considering their results with the first and the third of their respective groups without considering their results with the last teams of their groups in order to permit Group F (Burkina Faso, The Gambia and Namibia) to stay in the competition for the two best second teams. In the case where Group k is reduced to four teams in the course of the competition, only the first team of the group will automatically qualify for the ACN. The second team will have to run for the three best second teams of the group.\u201d My interest lies in the phrase \u201c Two best second teams of the ten other groups\u201d Quickly I started studying all the first and second placed teams of the ten groups of four and my study was not very cheering. Presently there are three groups where the difference in points between the first and second placed teams is just one point. Worse, in Groups D and I the first and second placed teams are on the same points, going into the home stretch with just two matches to spare. So? I heard the Technical Committee of the NFF had an emergency meeting in Lagos on Saturday. I believe they will rise with concrete decisions on how to qualify\u2026\u2026..I believe. So I better stop worrying. Meanwhile, is it true that we have decided to face Argentina again, a full strength Argentina squad barely two days after the bruising encounter in Madagascar? I reserve my comments. Back to my original thoughts for the week, particularly the spectacular triumph of China\u2019s Li Na at the French Open, an historic feat that gave a breath of fresh air to a world bedeviled by natural disasters and uprisings in the Middle East and the North of Africa. My conclusion was simple. If Li Na could do it, if an Asian could break into a world considered a reserve of Europe and the US, so can Africa, Nigeria, only to be shocked the next day by Tunisian media who relegated Li Na to the back pages of sports and emblazoned on the front pages a certain Ons Jabeur the 17 year old who won the girls event in the same French Open. Throughout my six day stay in Tunisia, the story was Ons Jabeur. The heroine who the Tunisian media say was not given her due. They even went ahead to condemn the Qatari television station Al Jazeera for having only interest in things negative in the Arab world. The Tunisian government was not spared either. Now, the media is launching a campaign for the star to relocate to either Europe or the US if she is to have any future in the game. In doing so they believe that at 17 she should be competing among the big girls. After all, at 16 in 1997 Martina Hingis had become number 1 in world tennis. Back home, I kept on searching for an identity, looking out for Nigerians on world stage, only for Dare Esan to authoritatively spoil my day by informing that Oludamola Osayomi will not be competing at the Oslo leg of the IAAF Diamond league. I still tuned in and watched the Kenyans, Ethiopians, South Africans\u2026..strutting their stuff. Will I fail to mention a certain Amantie Montsho from Botswana, yes Botswana who won the 400 metres flat in 50.13 seconds? Then came a relief as Ezinne Okparaebo lined out for the 100 metres dash. Nigeria at last. It was only when the introductions were made that I was shocked into the realization that she \u201cwas\u201d from Norway! THAT KANU TESTIMONIAL Was amused to hear that Kanu has pulled himself out of the national team. Is that the way it is done? For all I know, Kanu must have organized a charity match to help raise funds for his foundation. When Nigeria, when the NFF is ready to send this great son of African football off, pull him out, then they will organize a testimonial for him, perhaps with his assistance. For now, we wait. LIFE JACKET UNDER YOUR SEAT POCKET Everyday we are harassed by \u201csafety\u201d demonstrations in airplanes. Some hostesses are very \u201chumane\u201d in preparing you for death, while others just give it to you raw. I am always fascinated by the person that says \u201c In the UNLIKELY event of loss of pressure, oxygen masks like this will\u2026\u2026.\u201d. others just eliminate the \u201cunlikely\u201d in the event. In all of this, the one that fascinates me is the life jacket drama. Meanwhile, no airline has thought it wise to demonstrate a true life jacket scenario for us. They make it look ordinary, just standing there, whereas I know that in the case of a life jacket situation, the pandemonium that will follow the search for the life jacket can only be imagined than experienced. Then I am told not to inflate the life jacket on board. That when I jump out, I should pull on the strings, and if it fails to inflate I should search for the tube and blow into it. \u2026..they make me laugh. Why must I wait for it to fail to inflate? Why don\u2019t I just blow into it directly? Besides where will I be when I jump out of the aircraft to have the luxury of my two hands and my lips, tugging at the inflation chords and so on? Looking at the pretty lady going on and on, herself not believing what she was saying, I said to myself \u201c in the unlikely event of having to evacuate this Royal Air Maroc aircraft, I was going to inflate my life jacket right here BEFORE jumping into the unknown.\u201d I also said to myself that should I land safely back in Lagos, I will give GOD all the glory for journey mercies. See you next week. Related",

        "author": "Ochereome Nnanna",
        "text": "By Ochereome Nnanna THE international human rights outfit, Amnesty International, AI, has engaged the Nigerian military authorities in a war of wits, accusations and counter-accusations since our armed forces embraced a full-scale campaign to overcome the Boko Haram Islamist threat in Northern Nigeria. The first sign of tension emerged shortly after former President Goodluck Jonathan, in January 2014, signed the bill outlawing homosexuality (especially gay marriage) in Nigeria. Most Western countries and local and international organisations (such as civil society groups which they fund) propagating their mostly alien and unacceptable values in the Third World suddenly became hostile to Nigeria, particularly the Jonathan regime. They directly and indirectly added their voices to the growing anti-Jonathan opposition, especially those based in the North which were perceived as using the Boko Haram terrorists as a political tool to oust Jonathan and grab political power. AI, which had harshly criticised the anti-gay law, descended heavily on the Nigerian Army. AI was no longer interested in the horrendous activities of Boko Haram, which were sacking villages and communities, slaughtering people like animals and carting away women whom they dehumanised just as they liked. These did not matter to AI. Instead, AI beamed its activities on the so-called human rights of Boko Haram fighters killed or captured during operations.Many Nigerians saw AI\u2019s slur campaign against the Nigerian Armed Forces as ill-motivated, hostile and malicious, perhaps due to the anti-gay law. It seemed to meld with the strange reluctance of the President Barack Obama regime to recognise Boko Haram as a foreign terrorist outfit, which also manifested in its refusal to sell arms to Nigeria to prosecute the war on terror. Obama\u2019s America and its non-state sidekick, the AI, seemed unwilling to even help Nigeria in coping with our explosive humanitarian crisis concerning the internally-displaced persons. Rather, their own headache was the \u201chuman rights\u201d of terrorists and the demonisation of our military. Following the change of government on May 29th 2015, and the assumption of power by retired Major General Muhammadu Buhari, the mindset and combat reflexes of our armed forces underwent a sudden psychedelic shift. During the campaigns, the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, and its supporters portrayed Buhari as a bloodthirsty tyrant and floated images of the people shot at the stakes in 1984 based on a decree Buhari made with retroactive effect making drug peddling a capital offence. Buhari had emotionally accused those behind the adverts and the station it was aired of propagating \u201chate speech\u201d against him. But nearly two years into his regime, those adverts have turned out to be prophetic. We have seen a growing \u201ckill-and-bury\u201d credential associated with our military, not just by AI, but also those that are being gunned after: the Indigenous Peoples of Biafra, IPOB, and the Islamic Movement of Nigeria (The Shiites). Since May 29th 2015, blood has flowed like a river across the face of Nigeria. We are not just talking about the blood of innocent Nigerians still being dispatched by Boko Haram suicide bombers in Borno State, even after the repeated \u201cdefeats\u201d of the Islamic terrorists. We are not even talking about the gallant and patriotic efforts of our military to eliminate them and give peace a chance in the North East. Since Buhari (the Grand Patron of Fulani cattle breeders association) assumed power, armed herdsmen militias have been killing Nigerians and driving them away from their homes across the nation, especially the Middle Belt and Southern states. Our dare-devil military, police and security agencies have either ignored the daily reports of the carnages or they merely made tepid efforts that never stopped the violence. In fact, it is those who speak out against the killings and ask people to be vigilant or defend themselves since the state is unwilling to do so, that are being threatened with arrest by the Department of State Services, DSS. The Amnesty International has, surprisingly, failed to look into this to help draw the attention of the world to crimes against humanity akin to the Janjaweed Darfur Sudan genocides. One wonders if it is because our military are not directly involved in these massacres? AI, however, has kept its eyes focused on episodes where the military turned its guns against unarmed Nigerians. In December 2015, the Shiites in Zaria, Kaduna State, provoked the military by confronting a convoy of its Service Chief, Lt. General Tukur Buratai. The army descended on the headquarters of the sect and some reports claimed that over 1,000 of its members were killed, though a Kaduna State Government bulletin admitted that 347 bodies were found in a secret mass grave. Up till today, the leader of the group, Ibrahim El Zakzaky, remains in detention. It should be noted that President Buhari and majority of Nigerian Muslims in the North are of the Sunni sect, which regards the Shiites as a mortal rival. The severity of the hit on the Shiites could be an expression of the political rivalry. Also coinciding with the period that Buhari ascended to power were the belligerent and inciting broadcasts of Radio Biafra, a pirate radio run by Mazi Nnamdi Kanu, the leader of IPOB. IPOB is an unarmed separatist group which continues to pursue its mission through non-violent protests. Buhari and his supporters see groups like IPOB as outfits raised against this regime, and their campaigns for the breakup of Nigeria gives the regime and its armed services self-justification to treat them in the same way they see Boko Haram. IPOB has held a series of non-violent protests, rallies and prayer meetings in parts of the South East and South-South, and each occasion has resulted in shootings, arrests and allegations of disappearances, which the military always denies. However, evidences of secret massacres are mounting. In April 2016, the DSS reportedly uncovered 55 bodies in shallow graves in Abia State. The Service sensationally disclosed that five of the bodies belonged to people of Fulani stock and blamed IPOB for their killing. But they failed to equally disclose the ethnic background of the rest of the 50 and who killed them, thus justifying the aforementioned jaundiced mindset shift in the military and security services of our country. On 24th November 2016, AI published a report accusing the military of killing and secretly burying 150 pro-Biafra protesters in Aba at a prayer meeting for the release of its detained members and the realisation of their separatist Biafra. Amnesty\u2019s report was based on its analysis of 87 videos, 122 photographs and testimonies of 146 eye-witnesses. And only recently, AI updated its country report on Nigeria and indicted the military for the death of 1967 individuals and the detention of over 1,000 people from December 2015 to February 2017; a charge that the military, through its spokesman Brigadier-General Rabe Abubakar, firmly disavowed. Instructively, 60 of these people were allegedly killed on 29th and 30th of May 2016 at Onitsha during the Biafra Remembrance Day by \u201cthe army, police, DSS and the Navy\u201d, according to the AI report. What a historic coincidence!: an international organisation connecting the days of darkness and blood in Nigeria perpetrated by the military on 30th of May 1967, with death figures fifty years later! I have written severally on this column that we should never bring back to power any military officer who fought in the civil war. They would always drag us back to the evil past. I warned that Buhari, historically, had an axe to grind and would drag us back 30 to 50 years. It is playing out in vivid colours. Unfortunately, our armed forces and state security outfits, which had undergone great democratic reforms in the previous 16 years, have become a reflection of their commander-in-chief. The world is taking note of these trails of blood of unarmed civilians. Our military should go beyond mere rebuttals and prove they are indeed a national institution which is there for the wellbeing of all Nigerians irrespective of their sectional backgrounds and political opinions. Our military and security agencies belong to no one and to everyone.Anything short of this is a betrayal of their constitutional mandate and sabotage of our nationhood. Related",

        "title": "$1bn for \u2018BH\u2019: Loan or supplementary appropriation?",
        "author": "Henry Boyo",
        "text": "By Henry Boyo I would like to bring to your attention, the urgent need to upgrade the equipment, training and logistics of our Armed Forces and Security Services to enable them more forcefully to confront this (Boko Haram) threat\u201d. \u201cFor this reason, I seek the concurrence of the National Assembly for external borrowing of not more than $1bn, including government to government arrangements for this upgrade\u201d. The above is an excerpt from a letter dated July 15, 2014 to the National Assembly from President Goodluck Jonathan on the urgent need to contain the Boko Haram insurgency, which has allegedly claimed over 13,000 lives since the insurgency began in 2009, and which according to the \u2018Human Rights Watch\u2019 has also led to about 2500 deaths this year. Inspite of President Jonathan\u2019s anxiety, the National Assembly delayed consideration of the content of the letter until Parliament resumed from its extended recess almost two months after receipt of the President\u2019s URGENT loan request; this lacuna may be indicative of the National Assembly\u2019s own perception of the Boko Haram threat as probably less urgent than was connoted in the Executive\u2019s letter of July 15th. Nonetheless, Boko Haram has, meanwhile, stepped up their assault from the regular pillage and reckless killings of innocent civilians to the open declaration of Islamic Caliphates in seemingly \u201cconquered territories\u201d! Evidently \u201cthere have been widespread criticisms of the President\u2019s proposal as Nigerians across political divides have questioned the expenditure of trillions of Naira to contain Boko Haram in recent years\u201d. Conversely, in defence of the $1bn loan, Mike Omeri, the Director General of the National Orientation Agency, noted that \u201cit is not out of place for a country to re-enforce its military capabilities,\u201d and \u201cthe loan being sought\u201d according to Omeri \u201cis not just to prosecute Boko Haram war, it is to re-enforce the Armed Forces\u201d. That the Armed Forces are poorly motivated and ill equipped may not be untrue, if we consider media reports of grievances of our troops and combatants; indeed, the recent assault by some soldiers on their commanding officer, was apparently triggered by the sight of the rifled corpses of their comrades who were slaughtered by an unexpectedly better equipped rag tag army of insurgents. Nonetheless, some critics of the $1bn loan request have urged the National Assembly to reject the proposal; for example, the Chairman of Lagos State House Committee on Strategy, Security and Publicity, noted that \u201cas long as corruption thrives, any money borrowed would be squandered by few individuals.\u201d The Human Rights Writers\u2019 Association, is also equally concerned that the proceeds of the loan may go the same way as the allocation of N76bn for the failed CCTV project for Abuja. Notable Lawyer and activist, Femi Falana has also demanded for a comprehensive audit of the expenditure of over N3000bn allocated for security between 2010 and 2013. Other loan critics have also suggested rightly or wrongly that the proceeds of the $1bn loan would be deployed to foot the expenses of the electioneering campaigns of Mr. President and the PDP for 2015 elections! Conversely, the Arewa Consultative Forum has expressed through its Secretary, Anthony Sanni that \u201cthe Group was in support of any measures by the government to end the insurgency, because the issue of security of lives and property is the primary responsibility of any government\u201d. Furthermore, a human right activist and Chairman of Coliation Against Corrupt Leaders Comrade Debo Adeniran also noted that \u201cwith the present security situation in the country, any right thinking person should support any measure that will curb the insurgency.\u201d However, since the resumption of the National Assembly from recess last week, the debate on the $1bn loan request is yet to commence in earnest; evidently, if early release of the sum of $1bn will actually be pivotal to tip the war against Boko Haram, then the National Assembly cannot firmly insist that the President should first justify the judicious application of 2014 defence budget of N960bn and over N3tn also appropriated between 2010-2013, as the process of a thorough audit and investigation may become protracted and give room for further murderous pillage and consolidation of Boko Haram\u2019s expansion in the North-East, with dire consequences for our economy and our country. In such event, the situation may have gone beyond redemption or may indeed require much more than the $1bn currently sought by President Jonathan to ultimately checkmate Boko Haram. In any case, some analysts may argue that it is inconsistent to quibble about a mere $1bn when we gleefully expend over $12bn to subsidise petrol prices in place of the widely canvassed realistic possibility of earning billions of dollars annually from a sales tax on petrol. Thus, in view of the present expansionary threat of Boko Haram, it would be useful if President Jonathan could immediately access the $1bn funding, with an assurance that tangible success would be achieved against the insurgence, while the National Assembly simultaneously commences thorough investigations on the application of the defence spending in 2014 and the N3tn budgeted for security between 2010-2013. Instructively, however, the provision of the $1bn funding need not be in accord with President Jonathan\u2019s request for an externally denominated loan; there is in fact no valid or defensible reason why we must seek for such loan which will come at a cost and further deepen our already oppressive debt burden, when in fact, we have over $5bn currently domiciled, idly, in an Excess Crude Account, which is ironically unknown to our Constitution; furthermore, it seems reckless and uncaring to pursue a $1bn loan at any cost when we currently celebrate an idle foreign reserves base of over $40bn with the CBN. Indeed, if we adopted the debt option for the requested $1bn, we may inadvertently borrow at a cost from those same institutions in which our \u201cExcess\u201d crude deposits and CBN reserves are domiciled with minimal yield! Besides, the process of acquiring external loans is not akin to a dumb and ready ATM, with immediate cash provision, as the application process for loans is traditionally more extended. In reality, our Excess Crude Account and CBN reserves are as perfect for immediate funding requirements as an Automatic cash dispenser if your account is already funded. So why go through the humiliation of borrowing when you own relatively healthy reserves? The National Assembly must not be befuddled to approve the request for $1bn external loan to combat insecurity; instead, it would certainly be more appropriate to enact a supplementary appropriation bill to debit our ECA or CBN reserves accordingly. \u2022Save the Naira, Save Nigerians.

        "title": "$1bn ECA deduction and decimation of Boko Haram \u2013 Rose Moses",
        "author": "None",
        "text": "Since last week when chairman of the Nigerian Governors\u2019 Forum (NGF), Abdulaziz Yari, announced to a very shocked nation that they had during a meeting of the National Economic Council (NEC), asked the Federal Government to withdraw $1bn (over N360 billion) from the Excess Crude Account (ECA) to fight Boko Haram, the public space has been abuzz with reactions, mostly of condemnation. Naira The ever busy social media, for instance, is flowing with stories of disaffection with the President Muhammadu Buhari-led Federal Government over the planned withdrawal. Many are wondering why a degraded Boko Haram has suddenly become quite an expensive project, while the cleanup of the heavily polluted Ogoniland where the crude comes from still remains on paper. Among critics is the Ekiti State Governor Ayodele Fayose, who quickly dissociated himself from the plan. \u201cFor posterity sake, I wish to place it on record that I was not among the governors, who approved the withdrawal of $1bn, almost half of our savings in the Excess Crude Account, which belongs to the three tiers of government, to fight an already defeated Boko Haram,\u201d he said. Fayose didn\u2019t just stop at that as he went on to tell anyone willing to listen that though the APC promised to wipe out Boko Haram within six months in office, it would seem that after 31 months, what they\u2019ve succeeded in wiping out is the economy and the means of livelihood of the people. According to him, N360bn is equivalent to what the Federation Account Allocation Committee (FAAC) shares to the FG, 36 States and 774 LGs monthly and Nigerians deserve proper explanations from the Federal Government on the rationale behind spending such huge sum of money to fight an already defeated war. In the same token, public discourse since that announcement has generally toed the same line. And you will not blame those that think the national treasury is daily being looted in readiness for the 2019 elections under the pretense of fighting Boko Haram among other dubious means. This is even more so when taken into cognizance that not long ago, a House of Reps committee had exposed another corruption where over N50 billion meant to be in the Treasury Single Account (TSA) was allegedly lodged into a secret account in total contravention of Nigeria\u2019s TSA policy. Who will also ever believe that under President Muhammadu Buhari, who was massively voted for in 2015 under the \u2018change mantra\u2019 with huge expectations that he will fight and bring corruption to a conclusive end, an Abdulrasheed Maina would happened? How about Babachir Lawal and the grass cutting saga? What about Ayodele Oke, sacked Director-General of the National Intelligent Agency (NIA) in relation to the $43.5 million locked in a private apartment in Ikoyi area of Lagos, as well as the controversy surrounding the acting chairman of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC)? As a matter of fact, a good number of top government officials in the Buhari-led government have been accused of one corruption allegation or the other, all of which the president is equally accused of turning a blind eye to. All of these go to justify the angry reactions that trailed the proposed ECA deduction, which the Federal Government, through various official and unofficial communications, has been justifying. But who spends $1 billion on a finished defeated foe? If $1bn (almost half of ECA) from the excess crude oil account is used to fight Boko Haram, how much would be needed to rebuild the whole nation, which in a manner of speaking, is in serious need of rebuilding? Though the narrative has changed, apparently because of the heat generated by the idea, Vice President Yemi Osinbajo\u2019s damage control, indicating that the planned deduction was not after all just for the fight against Boko Haram but would be used to assist all of different security challenges in the states, Nigerians are not fooled. And assuming that is even the case, Nigerians need a breakdown of how the money is to be shared. As it is, 16 local government chairmen in Ekiti state have sued the Attorney General of the Federation and governors of the 36 states over the issue, \u201cdemanding an order of injunction restraining the Federal Government and the 36 states governors, their agents, servants, privies, representatives in interest, howsoever called and by whatsoever name designated, from giving effect to the appropriation and/or approval of appropriation of the sum of $1 billion or any other sum whatsoever, from the Excess Crude Account of the Federation.\u201d It would be recalled that the Nigerian Governors\u2019 Forum during the Goodluck Jonathan\u2019s administration had sought legal action against the Federal Government for making such deductions to offset fuel subsidy, saying it negated the principle of federalism and budgetary provision. If that was the case then, when and who must have amended the constitution for the action to be right now, more so when the same government had on several occasions, announced to the world that Boko Haram had been decimated?

        "author": "Uche Oyebadi",
        "text": "By Uche Oyebadi Americans have a variety of political traditions. Each presidential election cycle, as is happening now, some of these traditions are replayed as the system makes its way towards meeting a crucial part of its democratic destiny and objective. One of the traditions that have withstood time and history is that of running a two-party system: the Democratic and Republican Parties that are perpetually in competition to outdo each other in occupying the seat of state power and politics. But, you might have thought that as democratic as the country presents itself, more political party voices would have been let into the electoral system. Well, nothing prevents a political party from sprouting up. However, the political culture and tradition in the U.S. have a way of killing off any planned attempt to destabilize the two-party structure. Two fairly strong and recent attempts to break the two-party mold came in the form of presidential candidates Ross Perot and Ralph Nader. Twice in 1992 and 1996 Texas billionaire Perot tried hard to de-couple the two-party engine of U.S. politics. He failed on both occasions, having spent millions of his wealth in the process and despite making media waves with his decision to run for the highest office in the land. In 2000, maverick Ralph Nader of the Green Party emerged on the scene and ran for the presidency. He failed, but garnered about 2.8 million votes which the Democrats felt should have legitimately gone to Al Gore who campaigned against George Bush. Democrats never forgave Nader for spoiling the political soup for them. By the time Nader ran again in 2004, the system had so taken care of him that he was a highly marginalized and ineffective man. Historian Richard Hofstadter aptly summed up the \u201cthird party\u201d phenomenon as follows: \u201cThird parties are like bees. Once they have stung, they die.\u201d Perot and Nader fully understand this truism about American politics. Another piece of tradition is that of candidates going through the excruciating primaries to determine the flag-bearer of each of the political parties. No candidate skips the primaries and caucuses, whether a challenger or an incumbent. The Iowa caucus is the first crucial and real test of political popularity. In 2008, Hillary Clinton who thought she was the front-runner was humbled to the third position in Iowa. She never fully recovered until she bowed out of the race. In that test of strength, Obama won 38 percent, John Edwards came second with 29.8 percent and a surprised Hillary landed on the third position with 29.5 percent. Today, Hillary is not taking Iowa for granted. She is very busy campaigning in Iowa with all arsenal in her political armoury. Doing the television debate is another strong tradition. 1960 marked the beginning of the debates and it showed even then that the power of such debates cannot be underestimated in the electoral process. It is about intelligence, knowledge of the subjects, poise, eloquence and all the razzmatazz of television screen appearance, especially appearance. Several studies have been conducted about the first of such televised debates which took place on September 26, 1960, between the young and handsome looking Senator John Fitzgerald Kennedy and vice president Richard Milhous Nixon. Nixon who appeared on stage looking ruffled was a contrast to Kennedy with good looks and dashing mien. People who heard the debate on radio thought that the normally erudite Nixon won; but people who watched it on television had no doubt that Kennedy trounced Nixon. Today, a gaffe on such debates is a one-way ticket out of the presidential race. Other interesting traditions include the expectation that candidates for the presidency should declared their assets as well as let people know the state of their personal health. The tradition I\u2019m paying more attention to in this column is that of the 1st 100 days in office. This tradition was introduced in July 1933 by U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt who, in fact, had meant it to be used to judge the efficiency level of the Congress. Today, it is a tradition that is applied to practically all levels of governance. Here is what Kenneth T. Walsh wrote about the idea of the 1st 100 Days in a 2009 article: It\u2019s not a perfect measure, but it\u2019s a useful one\u2014the 100-day standard for gauging presidential effectiveness. The underlying truth is that presidents tend to be most effective when they first take office, when their leadership style seems fresh and new, when the aura of victory is still powerful, and when their impact on Congress is usually at its height. There is nothing magic about the number, and many presidential aides over the years have complained that it is an artificial yardstick. But it has been used by the public, the media, and scholars as a gauge of presidential success and activism since Franklin D. Roosevelt pioneered the 100-day concept when he took office in 1933. I have no philosophical opposition to assessing any president after 100 days in office. True, I do not expect tangible results. Neither is it a realistic expectation. But, I believe any one running for office should arm himself or herself with a blueprint for governance and start reeling off pages of that book once the person sits on the saddle. The 100-day landmark is about an examination of what is being done or implemented; not what has been achieved. This idea of winning a presidential election and turning around to tell people who elected you in good conscience that you did not know the extent of the rot left behind by your predecessor, is as laughable as it is lamentable. It is the equivalent of driving a car at night without headlamps, only to exclaim surprise upon running into a ditch. Americans also have another politically traditional expectation that is tied to the 1st 100 days in office: leaders are supposed to hit the ground running; work begins on day one! Put in soccer analogy, hitting the ground running is the equivalent of a good striker like Ronaldo already knowing what to do with the ball as it is in flight to him. The unintelligent striker gets the ball, and begins to think of what to do with it. Let me simply say that with Buhari battling to name his cabinet as his 1st 100 Days in office approaches, it appears he might reverse the American (and indeed a reasonable) expectation by running to hit the ground, not hitting the ground, running.

        "title": "2-POINT AGENDA FOR MR. PRESIDENT!",
        "author": "Les Leba",
        "text": "By Les Leba In an attempt to encourage Nigerians to see the Jonathan,s Presidency as a continuation of Yar'Adua's 'legacy', the Federal Executive Council recently announced their adherence to the late President's controversial 7 Point Agenda. There appears to be some consensus amongst critics that adequate power provision and electoral reform are probably the most critical areas to which resources and efforts should be skewed.\u00c2 It is expected that adequate power provision would stimulate industrial and commercial activities at all levels from that of the self-employed to the small & medium and the larger conglomerates. In this manner, our growing army of unemployed youths will find work and this may reasonably be expected to improve the level of security in the land and improve government's revenue base, even as industrial production costs fall with reduced expenditure on generators and fuel. The question, however, is whether it is rational to expect adequate power supply with the current constitutional framework with regards to power generation, transmission and distribution.\u00c2 It seems that critics who demand that power should be one of a 2-Point Agenda generally expect that government should spend more money on the sector; but, as discussed in an earlier article titled XX\"Why Adequate Power Will Remain Elusive\"\u009dXX of 07/06/2010, this cannot be the way as it is patently obvious that government does not have the funds to provide adequate power! Our dream for adequate power can only be adequately funded by private investment; meanwhile, the sector will remain relatively unattractive for such investors so long as 1999 Constitutional provision of PHCN monopoly of transmission and distribution of power remains in place! The second leg of the Two-Point Agenda as often proposed by critics is that of electoral reform.\u00c2 Nigerians have been convinced by politicians and the media that electoral reforms will usher in free and fair elections, where each vote will count.\u00c2 It is argued that such a scenario will become possible, if the President has no say particularly, in the choice of the Chairman of the Electoral Commission and also adopts other key electoral requirements such as deferment of the swearing in of elected officials until all pending petitions are disposed of and the shifting of the onus of proof to INEC in the Uwais report. But again, the questions must be asked 'will electoral reform, as currently proposed, really ensure that Nigerians who want to serve rather than those who wish to steal enter into the political arena?'\u00c2 'Will electoral reform, as currently proposed ensure that political parties will be formed on the basis of common beliefs in service and sacrifice to the fatherland rather than on the platform of opportunistic cabals, whose fight for power is for self enrichment?'\u00c2 'Can a party made up of honest, sincere and patriotic Nigerians with a social conscience ever garner enough clout to successfully contest against money bags, who see politics as an enterprise?'\u00c2 (Gani Fawehimi's National Conscience Party is a reference point) 'Will electoral reforms, as presently proposed, reduce the degree of corruption in the electoral process and public office?' 'How useful can electoral reform be, if elections are predicated on a far from comprehensive and credible electoral register?'\u00c2 'Will electoral reform reduce the political tensions in the country and stem the rising agitation for self determination by the Oodua States in the West, MASSOB in the East, Niger Delta militants and Middle Belt activists?'\u00c2 'Will electoral reform eradicate perceived inequities and social injustices that threaten to tear our country asunder?' Or indeed, will electoral reform succeed in cleansing the judiciary of those bad eggs who see elections as good business? The truth is that, Nigerians have been deliberately led by a cunning political class with media collaboration to believe that electoral reform is the answer to our political problems as a nation.\u00c2 How na\u00c3\u00afve can we be?!\u00c2 The numerous laws and amendments to promote accountability and service in all facets of Nigeria's political, social and economic life are still subsisting, but these laws are observed more in their breach than compliance by the executive and legislatures; so it is clear that the apparent consensus on power and electoral reform as the critical 2-point agenda of choice may also not really be meaningful in terms of the desired impact on social cohesion, welfare and security. So, if the 7-Point Agenda (consisting of energy, security, wealth creation, education, land reform, mass transit, Niger Delta) is considered too broad to be impactful, it would seem that a condensed 2-Point version with power and electoral reform as arrow heads maybe equally also inadequate to fulfill our aspirations as a nation.\u00c2 So, the million dollar question is what can Jonathan honestly do to strategically position our country for rapid economic growth and social development in the remainder 10 months of his inherited tenure? We have earlier noted in this analysis that improved power supply has potential to release such benefits, but unfortunately, constitutional shackles will make adequate power supply unrealizable. Thus, it must be imperative that Jonathan should remove the provision that XXlimits the states' power for generation, transmission and distribution of electricity only to areas not covered by a National Grid system within that state\"\u009d.XX in the 1999 Constitution for our country to realize its greater potential. But would such a single measure be adequate to set Nigeria on the path of industrial regeneration and expansion and also provide a stable platform for sustainable peaceful coexistence among the various geopolitical divisions?\u00c2 Indeed, will liberalization of the power sector engender equity and social justice in our polity?\u00c2 There is general recognition that even a progressive and industrious nation cannot remain stable if perceived inequity and injustice form the foundation of such a state. Thus, if Jonathan truly loves this country and wishes to reposition Nigeria for future stability and growth, Mr. President will have to do much more than just provision of adequate power.\u00c2 There is undoubtedly a need to jettison the 1999 quasi unitary constitution for a truly federal arrangement.\u00c2 Only a constitution that enshrines fiscal federalism will ensure lasting peace, stability and better governance. Indeed, Jonathan must recognize the futility and wastefulness in our 36 states structure; an erudite scholar himself, Mr. President cannot fail to notice the huge component of government revenue that is needed to run 36/37 executive governors' offices and 36/37 Legislatures with their usual security paraphernalia.\u00c2 This type of spending pattern will ensure that less than 1% of Nigerians in the political class will continue to consume over 30% of total revenue. Dr. Jonathan must recognize that government's centralization of revenue consolidation and disbursement over the years is the factor responsible for the failure of otherwise productive and self-sufficient economies in different parts of the country; for example, the groundnut pyramids, hides and skins export, palm oil, cocoa and rubber export will never again engage tens of millions of our countrymen because of the colonization of the oil fields of the Niger Delta by the centre and the consequent monthly bonanza of cash allocations to fund leaking treasuries of 36 states and 774 local governments. So, if Mr. President cruises through the next 10 months without so much as a thought for equitable restructuring of our body polity, then his sincerity and commitment to midwiving a virile and proud African nation must be questionable. Indeed, Jonathan does not have to reinvent the wheel; fortunately, the template of the 1963 Republican Constitution is still there.\u00c2 The dream of self-determination of our founding fathers galvanized growth and development to the envy of the current Asian tigers at that time and that spirit should be rekindled.\u00c2 It is in fact the 1963 Constitution that should be amended in the light of past and current realities and certainly not the 1999 Constitution, which ab initio was never a peoples' constitution, but a military imposition that has continued to evoke distrust, inequity, poverty and instability in the land. Every true patriot of this country recognizes that the current Constitution encourages idleness and diminishing productivity; why work when you can access bigger and bigger allocations depending on the political clout derived from ethnic, political, population or other such unproductive divisive platform. President Jonathan is well positioned to do it right so that Nigeria can once again inspire hope and pride amongst Africans everywhere in the diaspora.\u00c2 But, the question is, will Jonathan choose to have his name written in gold in the annals of world leaders such as Nelson Mandela of South Africa? Well, only Mr. President can answer that question.\u00c2 But there is no doubt that he could wear the crown of success even if his tenure does not exceed the next 10 months, if he uses his power of incumbency to ensure that a truly federal constitution is adopted before his exit.\u00c2 Indeed, it is only in this manner that all the goals of Yar'Adua's 7-Point Agenda can be achieved simultaneously! Thus, true federalism will reduce agitations for self determination everywhere, including militancy in the Niger Delta.\u00c2 States and geopolitical divisions will look inwards as in the past to tap value from local resources; corruption at the centre will diminish, the fight for political power will no longer be 'do or die' as there will be less and less money to steal at the centre.\u00c2 It would be easier to identify and deal with treasury looters in the states or local governments as indigenes of each state would not take kindly to public officers' theft of the product of their toil and sweat, as opposed to the current attitude of celebrating those who have succeeded in stealing more and more of the proceeds from the Niger Delta's oil fields! However, even if our President chooses not to rock the boat from a political standpoint, he could still score some vital points with the management of the economy.\u00c2 Indeed, he could transform the economy positively beyond recognition within six months, if he simply recognizes that the main obstacle on the path of industrial economic growth is our Central Bank's unhealthy monopoly of the forex market. If President Johathan insists that distributable dollar revenue must never be captured and substituted with increasingly worthless naira notes by the CBN, a transformation would begin to evolve such that interest rates will naturally fall below 10%, industries will be resuscitated, employment will climb geometrically, there will be increased demand and other sectors of the economy including the goals of Yar'Adua's 7-Point Agenda will become positively impacted.\u00c2 So, if you ask me, President Jonathan should pursue a 2-Point Agenda; that is, install a truly federal Constitution and/or dismantle CBN's monopoly of the forex market; preferably both, but certainly either of these pursuits will most likely positively transform our country. Save the Naira, Save Nigerians! Related",

        "author": "Obi Nwakanma",
        "text": "By Obi Nwakanma At last the Federal government has committed to hiring independent Forensic Auditors to verify, and get to the roots of the persistent allegation of a missing $20 billion from the oil accounts. This move was announced on Thursday by Finance Minister and the Federal government\u2019s Chief Treasurer, Dr. Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, at a press briefing following her appearance before the senate\u2019s Finance Committee which had commenced investigations into the alleged missing funds. There has been a back-and forth between Dr. Okonjo-Iweala andMr. Sanusi Lamido, the nation\u2019s two top fiscal managers on the question of the gap in the NNPC\u2019s accounting of the oil revenue, and it has thus far been a civil and respectful exchange between the two top managers of Nigeria\u2019s public finance who have basically agreed to disagree on this matter. CBN Governor Lamido has persisted in his own account of an unreconciled $20 billion that should accrue to the Federal government from sales of oil, but which by his own records have not be remitted to the federation account. Mr. Lamido has stated that CBN records indicate that national oil receipts available to the CBN show that the NNPC sold $67.8 Billion worth of crude in the past year with only $47.8 billion remitted to the federation account. The shortfall of $20 billion has been the subject of contention. On the other hand, the Finance Minister, speaking for the federal government, the NNPC and the Oil Ministry, has persisted in their own defence, that no such thing as $20 billion is missing. Basically, that the gap is all a figment of the imagination of the CBN governor. Clear attempts have been made to politicize the CBN governor\u2019s narrative and place upon it the integrity factor. Some have said that Lamido\u2019s knowledge of accounting is rotten; some have said that he is merely bloviating to get on the nerves of the president and the ruling PDP because he has eyes on higher office via the new APC. But what has become clear is that this is a $20 billion worth story that will not go away. Indeed it should not because, aside from the fact that $20 billion is no mere chump change, there is the fundamental question of how Nigeria\u2019s national revenue account is managed. OIL REVENUE\u2014Minister of Petroleum Resources, Mrs. Diezani Alison-Madueke (middle) answering questions from journalists, after an investigative hearing by the Senate committee on Finance on alleged unremitted oil revenue, at the National Assembly, in Abuja, yesterday. Photo: Gbemiga Olamikan. This would not be the first time allegations of huge withdrawals and disappearances have happened in Nigeria\u2019s oil accounts; huge monies that have disappeared in black holes and never to be seen again, except in the hints of private accounts in Switzerland, the Caymans, and such tax havens. What Sanusi\u2019s crusade, if indeed it turns out to be a true crusade and not a hatchet job will do is to open very wide, the nature of this black hole and the dark matter that resides therein. I must say that I personally took a skeptical view of Sanusi Lamido\u2019s challenge initially, at that point when Dr. Okonjo-Iweala, about three weeks ago came to clarify the situation of the accounts and provide its traces. I think that the initial scepticism was largely because the specifics of the CBN Governor\u2019s narrative were lost in mediaspeak. It did seem for a while that Sanusi Lamido claimed that $67.8 billion had gone missing. The finance minister\u2019s rebuttal which located and placed the money in context seemed like a credible and reassuring rebuttal. It did seem like the CBN Governor did not have his facts, and was uncertain about what was missing from the accounts. Was it $67.8 billion or was it $20 billion? In any case, if this $20 billion is missing from oil revenue in the last year alone, what about the accounts of the last five years since he has been Governor of the Central Bank? He seemed inconsistent. But as we continue to listen and learn from the parties involved in this unfolding drama, one thing is certain: the NNPC account is a doggone mess. Okonjo-Iweala herself acknowledged this at Thursday\u2019s Press briefing: \u201cThe oil account is a very complex business,\u201d she said. \u201cFor example, oil is lifted to pay back what is called \u201ccarry arrangement \u201c in which oil is supplied for loans taken by NNPC in the past and is to be paid back in crude oil to those creditors who gave NNPC those loans. So when you look at it, someone can say there is a missing x number of barrels which should have been accounted for. But it is used in paying for debt owed by the NNPC. That is why we are asking for forensic audit so that we can have all these things clearly verified. You can\u2019t just look at the balance of payment numbers \u2013 you will not get it right. Those are some of the reasons why we said it is a complex issue. Let us get the experts into this and let them give account to Nigerians.\u201d This is startling. What the Finance Minister simply is saying is that Nigeria\u2019s oil account is a primitive system that is bound to yield primitive and inconsistent results. The labyrinth has been in-built to create all kinds of diversions, and within those diversions, all kinds of leakages which has made the NNPC one of the most corrupt institutions in Nigeria\u2019s bureaucracy. It has been called \u201ca government inside a government.\u201d But its day must come, and we must put an end to the massive looting of Nigeria\u2019s national revenue. If the Sanusi challenge must accomplish anything, this is it. So far, officials of the NNPC have failed to give a convincing account about the revenue gap of $20 billion that ought to come into the federation account. The Minister for oil, Mrs. Diezeani-Madueke and the NNPC MD, Mr. Andrew Yakubu have at separate moments tried to fob off the question by insisting that the alleged $20 billion has even in part been applied to kerosene subsidies. This is Sanusi Lamido\u2019s challenge: there may yet be no monies missing as might be revealed by the so-called \u201cForensic\u201d accountants, but there is a great urgency to clean-up Nigeria\u2019s oil business and its accounting procedures and management. The NNPC must operate within the framework of its role as established by law. It is also heartwarming in one particular sense: Lamido Sanusi\u2019s principled and defiant stance is evidence that we are beginning to rebuild the institutional systems that check governments and help keep their noses clean. We may yet thank Mr. Sanusi Lamido for this, irrespective of the outcome of the senate investigations and the forensic examination of the Nigerian oil accounts. Related",

Held in Lagos, the event which was witnessed by celebrities and fans of the contestants, who converged at the venue from different parts of the country, showcased the essence of true beauty meant to be exemplified by a typical, cultured Nigerian woman. Having had a keenly contested pageant with lots of cultural embellishments to distinguish it from many other pageants, Queen Ebonyi, Diamond Okoh Obiahu dazzled the judges from the point of screening through boot camp to the grand finale as she emerged the winner, thereby crowned as the Queen Nigeria for the 2014 edition of the pageant. The first runner up was Queen Abia, Chidinma Oti while the second runner up was Queen Delta, Lolita Oyibo Onome. Also, Queen Cross River, Blessing Edidiog emerged as Miss Congeniality while the Miss Photogenic award was given to Queen Kaduna, Olive Sadiq. As parts of the event to spice up the day, many interesting performances were featured by notable musicians, poets and dancers. The Queens also performed choreography with a blend of traditional, contemporary and classical movements. Queen Diamond Okoh Obiahu, a Diploma in Public Administration holder who is currently studying Sociology and Anthropology at the University of Nigeria, Nsukka, went home with a cash prize of 1.5 million naira, a car and other consolation prizes. The CEO of Famford Enterprise Limited, Segun Famodimu, organisers of the pageants, expressed a sense of fulfillment at the emergence of the queen. \u201cI feel good. It\u2019s been serious hard work, and I bless God for the strength to follow through to the end. I want to thank my team for a job well done and the support they gave towards the success of this event. I pray next year\u2019s edition will be bigger and better and we get more support from sponsors and partners alike,\u201d he said. The event which held in collaboration with NTA and TV Enterprises was anchored by Uti Nwanchukwu and Zainab. Related",

        "author": "John Amoda",
        "text": "By John Amoda WE run an executive driven government and this is why unconstitutional change of the executive government is followed by constitutional retooling of the political system. In this process, the legislative and judicial branches offer no barrier to unconstitutional change of government. The Legislators are disbanded and the judicial branch reduced to crafting decrees. The 1999 return to civilian rule encouraged the thought of bottom-up reform of the political system and order, a ferment that the transition from President Yar\u2019Adua\u2019s Administration to President Jonathan Goodluck\u2019s encouraged. Now it is being noised in the media that the President may seek a second elected term in 2015. The question is why? What will he do differently in 2015? Have polls be conducted to measure his popularity? And in the midst of near universal consensus for a conference on the State of the Country, it is necessary that strategic thinking on the future of Government be led by the Executive Branch. It is in this context that I go back to 2010 to look at what I thought President Jonathan should do and why? For in doing those things I argued he could contribute to the building of the New Nigeria. The following is the 2010 Discussion Note that was written to promote critical engagement of the polity by the President. Changing the Terms of Discourse of Nigerian Reform Agenda 1.Incumbency is not enough: it is necessary but not sufficient to drive the Reform Discourse. For Visibility, Viability and Relevance the C-In-C must change the terms of discourse of the Nigerian Reform Agenda. -He cannot be led by the Justice Uwais Committee- they can only make recommendations; -He cannot be led by Prof. Atahiru Jega- He is a facilitator in the process; -The President must think strategically: \u201cStrategy is merely the word we give to the thought that goes into determining how we will prevail. However, strategies can be formulated that maximise the chance of delivering \u201cgood\u201d New principles are required to change our path onto this \u201cgood path\u201d. Ketan J. Patel. The Master Strategies: Power, Purpose and Principle. 2.Time is an obvious constraint. Exclusive attention to administration on the part of the President will detract from his roles as Head of State and Head of the Ruling Party. There is need for the C-In-C to strategically preside over the affairs of the Nigerian state and to do this the President must effect change of the framework of the current political discourse in order to effect a change in how he President is perceived both nationally and internationally. The theme for the Transformation Agenda simply stated is- Now Is The Moment To Lay The Foundations of Nigerian Republican Democracy. An aide memoire to jump start this change is the Presidential Address of Professor J.M. Amoda at the 15th Annual Conference of the Nigerian Political Science Association held at the University of Ibadan from June 25th to July 1st 1988 titled: General Danjuma and the Nigerian Republic. General T. Y. Danjuma\u2019s observation that there is yet to be a government in Nigeria that the people can defend is the thesis addressed in that Presidential Address. We propose that President Jonathan Goodluck make as his Agenda for the present and the future the laying of the foundation on which can be instituted The Government That Can Be Defended By The People of Nigeria- A Democratic Republican Government. The following quote from the 1998 address serves an Executive Summary of the 7 \u00bd Page Address: \u201cIf we are to truthfully confront the history of our existence as an independent national society, we cannot escape the implications of the fact that under the present conjunction of forces and interests that a planning of alternate futures for Nigeria must begin with an acknowledgement of the place of the Nigerian Military in our political process. This is all the more important because we have presented ourselves to the world and its comity of nations as a Republic. The preponderance of the Military in our politics therefore brings to the fore its relationship to the Republic. We often forget that the opposite of the Military in any Republic is not the Civilians or Politicians; that Military Rule in a Republic is not the opposite of Civilian Rule by politicians. The dominance of the Military in a Republic implies the collapse and or underdevelopment of Republican institutions. The interplay of military and civilian forces in this sense describes the collapse or underdevelopment of Republican institutions. The interplay of military and civilian forces in this sense describes the collapse or underdevelopment of republicanism in Nigeria. It is therefore not surprising where our political history and discourse have been structured and articulated in terms of military-civilian incumbency of Government, that we have been unable to build solidly the foundation of Republicanism in Nigeria and to comprehend fully the character of Nigerian Government itself. The result has been an unfortunate, if not tragic dichotomy, of Government versus The People. Government has been severed from its base and exists on presumptions. This is why General Danjuma arrived by a wrong path of reasoning to a correct conclusion. Yes General Danjuma is correct (when he opines) that we may never enjoy Democracy in our life time. Yes he is correct that we are yet to have a civilian Government we can defend. He is correct because no civilian Government can be defended by the people because civilians, even where the elections are not sheer exercise in fraudulent practices operate an Anti-Republican Government. He is correct beyond his own calculation. Government so long as it is anti-Republican, whether it is Good Military Government or Excellent Civilian Government, cannot be defended by the people. The reasons for this is because Government as it is instituted is animated by the spirit of Colonial Rule and Authority. Government as it is instituted in Nigeria is Colonial and not Republican. This is the true contrast. The contrast of military versus civilians, good military versus bad civilian governments are false contrast with real implications. What was papered over through the euphoria of independence was the takeover of the powers of the Colonial Government; the State, Economy and Society as instituted under colonialism were not changed. What changed was the Administration and Administrators of these structures. Thus ,whether the first Republic Civilians had been more or less democratically selected, whether or not they and their successors had been more patriotic that they were judged to be, so long as independence was administered as change of incumbents of a colonial structure of economy and governance in time the spirit of Colonial Autocracy would have destroyed the emerging spirit of Republican Democracy. Right from the beginning the structure of the polity was therefore hostile to Republicanism in Nigeria. This is why the civilians have been easy victim of coup d\u2019etas and this is why Good Civilian Government cannot be the antidote to Military Rule; indeed this is why Chapter 2 of the 1979 Constitution was a piteous and normative affirmation of Nigerian Republicanism\u201d The implementation of an Agenda of Republican Democracy in Nigeria would create a New Political Progressive Constituency providing a wholesome umbrella for the present so called Progressives, Awoists, Aminu Kano followership, labour, ASUU, Pro-Democracy Civil Society Organizations e.t.c. Such an agenda identifies what the military are and what must be changed to transform them into Republican Democratic Armed Forces of Nigeria. It will provide the new INEC their Mission Statement and Strategic Objective. Right now all they have as an aim is to deliver a fair and free election under the present structure of government, economy society and the state. Related",

        "title": "2011: ANOTHER BUDGET OF DESPAIR \u2013 2",
        "author": "Les Leba",
        "text": "By Les Leba Since the first publication ofthis article in January 2011,the unlikelihood of a beneficent impact of the 2011 budget has been given impetus by the National Assembly\u2019s increase in consumption budget by N433bn and CBN\u2019s increase of Monetary Policy Rate to 7.5%. These negative initiatives may increase our debt burden and service charges beyond the N542bn projected, and restrain the growth of the real sector with higher cost of borrowing. Inflation rate may also exceed 12% with severe consequences for all income earners, especially for the poor, and the N18,000 minimum wage may bring little succor to recipients. Inevitably, the electioneering process and Finance Minister\u2019s objection to NASS\u2019s budget hike will also further delay President Jonathan\u2019s assent of budget 2011, and compound its implementation. \u201cThe purpose of the 2011 Appropriation as a budget of fiscal consolidation is to strengthen our macro economic environment and to achieve enhanced employment generation and wealth creation.\u201d The above excerpt from President Jonathan\u2019s Budget proposals encapsulates the core expectations from the successful implementation of the 2011 Appropriation bill. However in the first part of this article, it was made increasingly clear that Mr. President\u2019s expectations may be expressed at best as mere wishes, \u201cas the copious dose of good intentions contained therein regrettably has no strong underlying substrata to actualize the dream.\u201d The pillars on which the Appropriation bill proposes to situate a strong macroeconomic environment and achieve enhanced employment generation and wealth creation appear to be weak and stunted; indeed they are no different from those adopted in the failed federal budgets of the last two decades or so! The moderation of the key issues of inflation, industrially friendly interest rate structure, appropriate exchange rate mechanism, infrastructural enhancement, security and reduced corruption and efficient utilization of scarce resources have always been paid considerable lip service, but expectedly, these budgets have generally failed on all these counts, only for the same promises and strategies to be eagerly rehatched, and clothed in new garb in subsequent budgets. For example, Mr. President expects that industrial regeneration and expansion will commence once AMCON, the new government_sponsored kid on the block, soaks up the toxic assets of banks, thereby providing them with new funds to extend credit to the real sector. Jonathan\u2019s \u2018hope\u2019 that \u201cbanks would accept their obligation to lend to the real sector in return for these support measures\u201d is as usual misplaced! We recall similar expectations in the past. Consolidation and increase in banks capitalization from N5 billion to N25 billion and the various cash injections to save some ailing banks in the last five years did not succeed in revitalizing the real sector or indeed in generating employment. Inspite of the recognition of the need/desire for single digit interest rates, industrial and commercial lending rates have consistently remained above 20%. Again, the problem was not lack of cash, as CBN has fought a perennial and unsuccessful battle with so_called excess liquidity or too much cash in the banking sector for over twenty years! In disciplined economies, banks would be expected to make money from service to the real sector, but our lot in Nigeria has been that of prosperous banks whose profits substantially comes from lending back money to government and other such underhand and unethical practices as forex round tripping, unbridled and uncollaterised margin lending; none of which endeavours impact positively on our economy. But why should banks care, after all, the 2011 Appropriation bill has already earmarked the sum of N542bn (over 50% of the capital budget) to debt servicing. Needless to be reminded that the banks will be the major beneficiaries of this largesse! The question is how can the same banks who continue to benefit from excessive government cash injections also be the main beneficiaries of government debt service expenditures? Incidentally, the proposed debt service figure of N 542bn may turn out to be actually modest for a number of reasons. If for example, the 2010 debt service was also about N 540bn, it is reasonable to expect that with the need for government borrowing to supplement RECURRENT expenditure (Salaries, allowances, incidentals) of over N2,481 billion, in addition to current debt service charges, the banks will certainly wear broad smiles at the end of the year. Secondly, the Appropriation bill makes no mention of external debt service and fuel subsidies! Indications are that our external debt which the authorities claim was below $4bn last year may have actually increased as a result of fresh borrowings in 2010 and other proposed additional foreign loans in 2011. Even when government recognizes that our external loans should normally attract low interest charges of below 3%, the service charges for external loans whenever government chose to reflect these in annual budgets has always been in excess of 12% and indeed touched 18% during the Obasanjo years! Finally, it must be said that AMCON\u2019S incursion into the money market as prime borrowers of up to N2500bn in the next year or so will inevitably balloon our domestic debt by about $15bn. In the event that interest payable on this tranche of sovereign instruments averages about 10%, the provision of N542bn as projected debt service in Jonathan\u2019s 2011 Appropriation bill may well be a gross underestimate. In any event, our national debt burden come December 2011 may well be in excess of $50bn, which makes the earlier excruciating burden of $35 or so billion dollars of four years ago pale in comparison! Well, the above debt burdens maybe condoned if, as per Mr. President\u2019s expectation , real sector growth, employment and wealth creation would be the positive products, but alas, in the light of the loose and the unfettered nature of these loans, it may not be prudent to place a bet on a fruitful or successful dividend. Once again, fortuitous increase in crude oil price above $90/barrel will increase the value of fuel subsidies over and above the current estimates of N500bn; surprisingly, no reference was made to this albatross in the 2011 appropriation bill! It is evident, however, that when this amount is inevitably captured in the budget estimates, the actual deficit will not only be much higher, but overall debt service charge may approach N1000bn, almost at par with the proposed capital budget of N1005bn and over 20% of expected revenue of N 4226bn. The unwritten fiscal rule for progressive growth in an infrastructurally deprived state such as ours is the conscious tilt of expenditure towards capital formation. Lagos state administration for example, has largely imbibed this doctrine and over the last three years, capital expenditure has progressively exceeded 60% while reducing recurrent expenditure has been better managed. The result is clear improvement in provision of security, health, education and transportation in the state. By contrast, the 2011 Federal Appropriation bill has allocated less than 24% to capital expenses with 76% allocation for recurrent and debt expenses. No cognate observer would accept this as a positive signal of President Jonathan\u2019s desire to seriously address our infrastructural deprivations. It is begging the question to defend the disparity with the obnoxious excuse that current provision of N1005bn is in fact much higher than the N 919.5bn \u201cactually utilized in the extended 15 months of the 2009? Fiscal year!\u201d President Jonathan observes that even though a total of about N900bn has been released or cash backed for capital expenditure in 2010, \u201ccapital performance varies across the MDA\u2019S , and confirms that average capital utilization is just under 50% as at the end of October!\u201d Over the years various administrations have often confused capital releases with actual successful implementations. Of course, Nigerians know better! Incidents of unspent budgets at the end of every year remains a permanent feature of our fiscal landscape. All manner of control agencies and systems have been adopted by different administrations to foster accountability and \u201ccapital project management best practices\u201d but so far the cancer of self interest and corruption have remained resistant to all prescriptions. There is nothing to show that President Jonathan\u2019s 2011 bill has found an antidote, not even the proposed global project management firms will do the trick; sooner than later they will, like Halliburton, Siemens, etc become compromised by the Nigerian disease. Even though, the current Appropriation bill does not specifically set any target for inflation rate, it would be unrealistic to expect that the indication of a rate of 13.4% as at October 2010 will positively work in favor of strengthening our macro economic environment, achievement of enhanced employment generation and wealth creation as per Mr. President\u2019s expectation. No economy became successful on the platform of such antagonistic inflationary level, especially when inflation rate of the family food basket, often times exceeds 15%! Such high rates invariably set the stage for significant loss in the value of personal incomes and becomes a retrogressive instrument for reduction of social welfare and the standard of living. It also becomes a great disincentive to savings, particularly pension funds; basic economics suggest that without savings there can be no investments, thus until the inflation rate is brought down to lower single digits, Mr. President\u2019s dream of a vibrant industrial and investment climate will certainly be moon lighting. Further more, such a climate can never lead us on the correct path to government\u2019s vision 20:2020. Indeed it has been speculated by government that Nigeria would need to grow its gross domestic product by an annual average of 15% to achieve vision 20:2020 certainly, the current growth rate of 7.85% for 2010 is many milestones behind this benchmark. There is yet no convincing framework in the 2011 Appropriation bill to energize or jumpstart our drive to the Promised Land. Finally, the oil production benchmark of 2.3 million barrels per day and $65/barrel crude price have become meaningless as planning tools or as indicators of potential revenue. Variation on these benchmarks over the years never seems to affect the level of deficits. Besides, no proper accounting or fiscal balancing has ever been made available in the light of actual revenue from varying crude oil prices over the course of every year, even though prices have never fallen below budget benchmarks at anytime. Indeed, prices have often climbed by up to 50% of the benchmark, but never have accurate statistics been openly available to determine by how much the huge price variation compensated the occasional variation in crude output & export. Besides, government has liberally used the instrument of deliberate Naira devaluation for revenue generation. In this event, the value to be derived from government\u2019s budgetary benchmarks may have been significantly diminished. What is clear from the above discussion is that 2011 will be a time of suffering aplenty for the vast majority of Nigerians, and the co_incidence of national elections into the various political assemblies may not encourage accountability and prudent management of our resources.

Indeed in the past three decades or so the most outstanding feature of our budgets has always been the glitz and razmattaz which accompanies the annual ritual of budget presentation. There is probably no greater testimony of serial budget failures than the abysmal state of our economy and the increasingly painful poverty of the vast majority of our people, inspite of the comparatively handsome revenue profile over the years. Paradoxically we seem to have ingeniously keyed in our budget process to support and sustain a frame work that would ineveitably make our people poorer in the face of increasing export revenue! Not surprisingly, the 2011 budget proposal, presented a couple of days before the annual recess of the National Assembly by the President Goodluck Jonathan, perfectly fits the mould of ealier budgets. In the place of the terse, hurried and meaningless contraption of the 2010 budget, the current proposal is verbose, and full of promise of good intentions but is equally futile as an instrument of economic rebirth and growth! The solid path to development is not paved in hype and propaganda, but in recognition of our failures and girding our loins and doing the right things to lift our people from poverty. Mr President\u2019s assurances of a \u201cresilient economy with robust GDP growth rates of 7.86%\u201dpaints a picture of a dynamic, progressive and successful economy, but we all know the truth! Inspite of the glossy picture, the rate of unemployment has continued its upward trajectory. Also inspite of the meager quantum incomes of the majority of our people, the inflation rate of the average family food basket remains around 15% with devastating consequences for the standard of living and welfare of most households; Mr. Presidents\u2019 2011 budget obviously also recognizes this contradiction between a resilient economy with such buoyant growth rates and the realities of rising unemployment, unbridled inflation a comatose industrial sub sector and the prevailing level of corruption and insecurity in the land. To this end, Mr. President has affirmed that this year\u2019s budget has been designed to enhance the \u201cinvestment environment for the real sector in a way that will foster INCLUSIVE growth so that ordinary citizens should feel the tangible benefit of our economic growth\u201d, with gainful employment levels commensurate with economic growth and wealth creation. Indeed the word INCLUSIVE appears to be the new buzzword in the government hype as it appears over a dozen times in the 2011 appropriation bill! But the truth is that absence of inclusive growth has been obvious to past administrations and they all wanted to remedy this flaw without any success. It is highly unlikely that this budget will succeed where others have failed as it equally contains a copious dose of good intentions but regrettably with has no strong underlying substrata to actualize this dream! How President Jonathan intends to revitalize the real sector and SMEs, which are the real engines of growth and employment with prevailing commercial lending rates at over 20% remains to be seen. Inspite of the good intentions all the past administrations have fallen at this doorstep to economic recovery. This column has maintained unflinchingly that the serial bail out packages for selected industrial subsectors will not do the trick, we have witnessed the failure of several such attempts in the past. The very modest N50bn seed funding for the National Job creation scheme would like NAPEP and other such programmes inevitably be riddled with misdirection and misplacement of priorities and the funds would be frittered away with barely little to show for it. Similarly, the public works programme which is expected to commence in the 36 states and the federal capital territory in conjuction with private sector contractors will similarly be plagued with bloated invoices and substandard jobs and since no specific targets have been set, the benefit from this programme will at best be superficial. Even a toddler in any of our urban centres today feels the impact of inadequate power supply and the acronym \u2018NEPA\u2019 forms part of their early vocabulary. The success or otherwise of the industrial subsector and the proposed National Job creation scheme in sustaining and increasing employment opportunities revolves around the output, transmission and distribution capabilities of PHCN. The attempts of past administrations to improve output and efficiency in this critical subsector have failed woefully. The 2011 budget proposal boasts of yet another road map without a time plan for achievement of specific output and performance targets; mean while the constitutional impediments with regards to transmission is unlikely to give independent power producers (IPPs) the confidence to invest in increased generation capacity inspite of the potential of government\u2019s incorporation of a Bulk Trader company with World Bank and Ministry of Finance partial risk guarantees! The reality of course is that a liberal production and transmission framework which recognizes the power sector as a state rather than federal responsibility will quickly transform this sector even without any World Bank or MOF guarantee. The 2011 budget proposal has apparently identified 50 priority projects recommended by the Infrastructure Concession Regulatory Commission for execution to boost productivity. Mr. President quite rightly recognizes that government resources are certainly inadequate to bankroll the implementation of these priority projects and the government appreciates that it would need to \u201clook to the private sector for the majority of the Capital requirement\u2026. to this end, government will focus on improving the business environment.\u201d Well , not surprisingly, earlier governments made similar promises without any real success, as production costs remained very high, especially with the burden of suicidal lending rates. The current administration\u2019s strategy is regrettably very much the same as in the past; \u201cincreasing allocation of cheap and long term credit to the real sector of the economy\u201d has failed to produce the desired result and it is clear that a policy of serial bail out packages may not be the way out! A more enduring and potentially successful strategy is to bring the cost of borrowing across the board to about 5%; special sectorial needs such as for education and wealth and Agriculture could then access loans at between Zero to a maximum of 2.5%! Mr. President\u2019s erroneously believes that the prevailing crisis in the financial system is responsible for their inability to lend to the real sector! We recall that bank consolidation and significantly increased capital base were also touted as a game changer for the real sector a few year back, but today we are very much wiser! The banks will continue to show no preference for the real sector so long as they continue to have the government as their main customer! The debt management (read as debt creating office)and the Central Bank are the prime buddies of banks; presently these government agencies continue to borrow close to N200bn from the banks every month, stifling credit to the \u2018supposedly risk prone\u2019 and infrastructurally deprived real sector. If President Jonathan sincerely wants the real sector to grow, let him direct the CBN and the DMO to stop borrowing for just 12months; the banks will then have no where else to turn but the real sector for their survival. As things stand, even in these times of stress in the banks, and inspite of the minimal lending to real sector, the banks almost without exception continue to declare fairly substantial profits. The question is from where are they making their money; certainly not from non performing loans, but most certainly from the same government that continues to pump easy money into the vaults of the banks every month, only to return soon after to borrow the money back on the spurious grounds of liquidity management and fostering of a market for long term debt instruments Mr. President is certainly not simple minded and he must be aware that no real positive change will be witnessed in the real sector in the next 12 months with such arrangement. Indeed, inspite of the best efforts of the newly established Assets Management Company AMCON, our National Debt will increase by over $15bn by the time that AMCON borrows N2.5 trillion from the Capital market (read as predominantly the same money deposit banks that receive humongous cash deposits from the CBN every month). In which case our national debt may well exceed $45bn, a figure that is much higher than the $35bn that forced us on our knees to the London and Paris Club only 3 years or so ago for debt forgiveness! While their surrogate presided over our finances to facilitate our separation from our money, incidentally same group of creditors are back at our door step with exhortations that Nigeria\u2019s low external debt is inappropriate. Mr. President also expects\u201d through the establishment of the Nigerian Sovereign Wealth Fund \u201c to entrench greater prudence in the management of our exhaustible oil wealth for this and future generations, as well as to use the fund as a catalyst for attracting investment into critical infrastructure\u201d. This appears to be an ingenious strategy to keep our economy in the woods. It is true that some oil producing countries have indeed established a sovereign wealth fund, but the reality of course is that most of these countries are in a much higher level of development and indeed industrial saturation than poor Nigeria! It appears illogical that we should go cap in hand abroad to borrow for infrastructural enhancement at a cost when we concurrently sit on idle funds which we save or invest in the economy of our creditors. Our commitment in view of our state of development should be to commit heavily to infrastructural enhancement so that we can survive now and thereby provide an appropriate platform for the welfare of future generations. The dollar which currently serves as our reserve currency stands the potential of losing value as a result of the United state\u2019s heavy indebtedness and our dollar savings could easily diminish overtime and thereby confine future generation perpetually to the unenviable group of fourth world countries. In any case, it seems like warped logic to expect foreign investors to come and invest here while you invest your own money abroad! Next week we shall comment on other aspect of President Jonathan\u2019s 2011 budget proposals and discuss the validity and likely impact of the key assumptions on which the budget is predicated.

        "author": "Tonnie Iredia",
        "text": "By Tonnie Iredia The on-going trial of some former Governors for corruption while in office is quite thought provoking for what it reveals- that the anti-corruption war in Nigeria is a cyclical unending relay race. Looking at where we are coming from, the situation is no doubt frustrating. During the first republic, the Balewa government declared corruption as the nation\u2019s main enemy. General Yakubu Gowon promulgated the \u2018Corrupt Practices Decree No. 38 of 1975 to deal with the subject. Murtala Mohammed sacked about 10,000 civil servants on the basis of corruption and related matters. President Shagari concerned about the high incidence of indiscipline and corruption inaugurated an Ethical Revolution Committee in 1982. After him, General Buhari swore never to \u201ctolerate kickback, inflation of contracts, forgeries, fraud and abuse of office\u2019. President Babangida resuscitated the Code of Conduct Bureau to which he added the Code of Conduct Tribunal in 1989 to handle corruption. For the same purpose, General Abacha set up the Failed Banks Tribunal and promulgated the \u2018Advance Fee Fraud and Other Related Offences Decree No. 13 of 1995\u2019. We have since added two formidable bodies-the Independent Corrupt Practices Commission (ICPC) and the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC). But till date, not much has been achieved in respect of the subject as allegations of corruption against many top leaders are becoming more bizarre by the day. The suspicion that the nation may not have the political will to try the high and the mighty is no longer an issue since we have in our anti-corruption drive, humiliated many-a former Senate President, a former Speaker of the House of Representatives, several former Ministers and Permanent Secretaries, Chief Executives of Banks and even a former Inspector General of Police! It seems it is time for us to introspect and ask another question-is Nigeria a naturally corrupt nation that openly purports to hate what it inwardly likes doing? This question is germane because of the many unwholesome things that our public institutions stand for. Why for example, is the Power Holding Company of Nigeria (PHCN) unable to provide a metre to anyone who can afford it so that everyone can pay his correct bill? Inexplicable too, is the fact that anyone who is lucky to get a metre is charged an amount for it every month notwithstanding that it was fully paid for before it was supplied. With constant power failure, it is difficult to quickly exhaust the credit in a PHCN recharge card, yet people are officially surcharged for not buying another card while their previous cards are still in credit. Another public body- the Abuja Water Board is never able to reconcile payment of bills to it through banks designated by it for the purpose. Although the board gets the original of the payment receipt from the bank, every consumer has to display in his premises, a photocopy of the duplicate copy of the receipt. This creates a conducive opportunity to extort money from those who panic over threat of disconnection or what else is the deliberate confusion for? With advanced technology, all our banks are now on- line making it possible for a customer who opens an account in one location to operate it anywhere in Nigeria but because our electoral commission has to retain some inherited avenue for fraud, it cannot use the same strategy to make it possible for a citizen to vote in a place different from where he was registered. Meanwhile, we hear that over 1,300 of the commission\u2019s Direct Data Capture Machines (DDC) have been allowed to be \u201cstolen\u201d from a designated custody. But theft in offices cannot be worse than the official fraud where many governments in the nation appoint countless 419 political employees as Special Advisers and Assistants into non-existent positions without any schedule of duties. Worse still, their bogus salaries- about ?200,000 per month are unrelated to their qualifications and experience as many of them have in actual fact, never worked before. How can a government be involved in the fraudulent practice of paying salaries to people who are deceitfully described as officials but who everyone knows have no job to do? At local government level, our councils are a haven of fraud. First, state governors divert a substantial part of their allocation and this has been confirmed-thanks to Governor Aregbesola of Osun state who openly decried the trend recently. Second, council officials are reportedly found in their offices only on the days fixed for sharing among themselves whatever their governors graciously give them. Whereas such officials across the nation tell whoever wishes to hear that they are short changed, they are part of the game. Only last week, local councils in Bayelsa state organized a lavish political rally to support their governor\u2019s gubernatorial ambition which was transmitted LIVE on national television- who paid for it? In 2009, 110 council areas selected from the 36 states paid eight hundred thousand naira (?800,000) each for an Award/Dinner event for Best-Performed Local Government Chairmen in Nigeria organized by some committees in the National Assembly. As for we the people, we are essentially hypocrites with respect to corruption in view of the large crowd of ethnic supporters who appear in court to show solidarity with persons who are standing trial. Indeed the atmosphere at the trial of anyone charged with corruption often looks as if it is government itself that is on trial. More often than not, the real suspect triumphantly enters the court amidst ovation which he acknowledges with his two hands like someone in a political party rally. In other words, we hate corruption but we love those accused of it; hence, when a citizen moves up into a big position, his friends and relations are quick to remind him that \u2018this is our time\u2019. What then is the definition of corruption in Nigeria? The case of Patricia Etteh, former speaker of the House of Representative seems illuminating. She was accused and indicted of corruption by her colleagues and then forced out of office. While the indictment subsisted, she was given national honours. At the tail end of the life-span of the House, those who openly championed her indictment eloquently alerted the nation that she really did nothing wrong earlier. Against this backdrop, it is obvious that the institutions of society set up to coordinate our fight against corruption have an awesome mandate. Surprisingly, they have feeble official support considering what we hear of a ministerial struggle to control them. It also explains why Farida Waziri, Chairman of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) is the one agitating for a special court to handle corruption cases whereas that should have been one of the tools we should have given her knowing the nature of corruption in our society and how difficult it has been to deal with. With the recent condemnation of plea bargaining by eminent Jurist- Justice Kayode Esho, we can only agree that corruption is now an attractive crime in Nigeria whose punishment consumes only a negligible fraction of the gains of the offence. It looks like a lost battle!! Related",

        "author": "Douglass Anele",
        "text": "By Douglass Anele Before the 1979 general elections in Nigeria, Ibrahim Waziri and some of his supporters and friends launched a political party called Great Nigerian Peoples Party (GNPP). The fundamental credo or political philosophy of the party was \u201cpolitics without bitterness.\u201d The rationale behind that attractive slogan is derived from the lessons that should have been learnt from the chequered political experience of the country since independence in 1960 which was punctuated at different times by senseless political violence, culminating in the Biafran War of 1967-1970. Recounting those ugly encounters here will clog our discourse with unnecessary details. Suffice it to say, however, that violence in the defunct Western Region, the military coup and counter-coup of January 15 and July 29, 1966, and the pogroms in the North against the Igbo shortly before the civil war had always cast an ominous shadow on the country\u2019s political evolution. Of course, the history of political violence in Nigeria is not restricted to the pre-civil war period. All the elections conducted thus far since the war ended had been marred by violence. Politically-motivated violence include deliberate physical assault on voters and election officials by hired thugs, assassination of political opponents and, lately, kidnapping of potential rivals or members of their families and loved ones. It appears to us that an overwhelming majority of Nigerian politicians have not learnt useful lessons from history about the ultimate futility of using violence to achieve political power. Our conclusion is corroborated by the fact that, as the date for commencement of the 2011 elections approaches, there is a disturbing increase in the number of politicians either kidnapped or brutally murdered. Penultimate week, the gubernatorial candidate of the All Nigerian Peoples Party in Borno State, Modu Fannami Gubio, his younger brother, Goni Mustapha Sheriff, and four others were killed in Maiduguri. Near my village, Ishi-Owerri in Imo State, the wife of Ikemba Ugochukwu Nzekwe, member representing Nkwerre State Constituency in Imo State House of Assembly, was kidnapped by unknown persons, an action widely believed to have been politically- motivated. Although, according to reports, the victim has been released after some ransom was paid, one can imagine the emotional trauma Ugochukwu and members of his family, in-laws, relations and friends went through during the period Mrs. Nzekwe was in the unwanted custody of strangers. These and other politically-motivated violent acts demonstrate that Nigeria is still at the infantile or primitive stage in political development characterised by the Hobbesian state of nature. Several reasons can be advanced why people resort to violence to achieve their political objectives. First and foremost, there are people with flawed personalities which predispose them to wickedness, no matter their position or career. Second, in Nigeria politics is conceived as a lucrative business. Our politicians operate on the basis of political capitalism: they see involvement in politics just the way a hard core capitalist looks at his investment in stocks. The ultimate motivation in both instances is financial gain \u2013 and the more profitable the better. Because of the bloated remuneration packages attached to political offices and the avenues such offices open up for patronages of all sorts, our politicians approach politics with a crude Machiavellian spirit, doing whatever they think is necessary to achieve their political ambitions. As a corollary, there is a widespread misconception that politics is a \u201cdirty game\u201d fit only for hustlers, misanthropes with the crudity and grit to perpetrate evil in order to win at all costs. The sit-tight mentality of politicians is also a factor in politics-with-bitterness. Virtually every president, governor, local government chairman etc. that had emerged till date wanted tenure elongation or a second term in office \u2013 it is widely believed that former President Olusegun Obasanjo schemed for a third term. The reason behind the provision for tenure extension in the 1999 Constitution is for continuity, such that an incumbent President etc. can have more time to execute his or her programmes and policies. But the problem is that, most politicians who sought (and got) tenure elongation did not deserve it because they performed woefully in their first tenure \u2013 and they knew it. Thus, to remain in power even against the wishes of the electorate, they employed violence against their rivals to intimidate or, in more extreme cases, liquidate them outright. We believe that one of the most effective ways of reducing drastically the phenomenon of politics-with-bitterness in Nigeria is to make political office less lucrative. Once the money factor is downplayed such that people of moderate means can join politics without worrying so much about the prohibitive cost of vying for elective positions or getting entrapped in the vicious grip of wicked godfathers, and access to huge easy money (like the one federal legislators are currently enjoying) is blocked, the ferocity with which the game of politics is played will reduce. In addition, Nigerians must begin to play a more active part in politics. It is simply not enough to complain and complain about the \u201cdirtiness of politics\u201d in the country: we should begin to get more involved in the political life of the society. This implies that we must learn to vote for the best candidates for different elective positions \u2013 best in terms of character and proven track record of performance in their chosen careers. Nigerians, if they are serious about ending political violence and politics-with-bitterness, must consistently reject at the polls candidates of questionable character and evil disposition. Our people should reject candidates fielded by political parties with a proclivity for violence. To illustrate, if a political party is dominated by a nest of killers, then voters should vote for good candidates from other parties. Civil society groups have to play a leading role in educating voters on how to make enlightened choices to avoid mistakes of the past which have retarded our political development. To be continued.

        "author": "Douglass Anele",
        "text": "By Douglass Anele We have discussed several reasons why a typical Nigerian politician plays politics with bitterness. Another factor to be considered is the way politicians treat one another, the kind of language they employ in addressing their rivals and opponents. Leaders of the dominant political parties in Nigeria oftentimes use uncomplimentary adjectives and pejorative phrases to describe politicians in opposing parties. The trend began with the inauguration of party politics during the colonial period. Since then, politicians have become less decorous in their speech. The latest is the widely publicised report that the President, Goodluck Jonathan, at a campaign rally in Ibadan stated that his party, PDP, will do everything in its power to wrest political power in the South-West geo-political zone from rascals. Clearly, the President was venting his personal frustration and disappointment because PDP has repeatedly failed to win Lagos State, and recently lost some of its governorships to rival parties. Of course, leaders of the Action Congress of Nigeria (ACN), have responded in the same uncouth manner to President Jonathan\u2019s verbal ballistic missile, in a situation where silence would have been golden. At any rate, even in the United States and Britain with mature democracies, politicians sometimes employ acerbic language while referring to their counterparts in opposing camps. For instance, President Barak Obama of the United States, during the presidential campaigns in 2008, was called all sorts of derogatory names (including \u201cmuslim terrorist,\u201d and \u201csocialist\u201d) by some extremist Republicans who were thoroughly disgusted with the prospect of a Blackman becoming America\u2019s President. But he survived and emerged victorious at the polls. Now, the major difference between the typical Nigerian politician and his Western counterpart is that, whereas the latter will send congratulatory message to his victorious opponent after election results have been announced, our politician will certainly reject the result if it did not favour him, on the ground that the election was rigged. Most times, Nigerian politicians who allege rigging also rigged; the problem is that they lack the honesty to accept that they were out-rigged. Because of politics-with-bitterness, most of our politicians are bad losers. Therefore, we ask: why should anyone who genuinely wishes to lead maim, kidnap, and kill some of the people he wishes to serve, in order to serve? If leadership is as demanding and arduous as Nigerian leaders both past and present say it is, why do we have politics-with-bitterness in the country? We believe that quack politicians and half-baked messiahs that have been privileged to lead Nigeria are chronic liars. How? Because these people pretended as if they were motivated by the desire to serve, by patriotic fervor to work hard for the people, whereas what was uppermost in their minds right from the beginning of their tenures was primitive accumulation. In countries whose leaders are truly working for the citizens, the physical stress on them is always obvious for everyone to see \u2013 more lines of stress appear on their faces, they sprout more grey hairs and lose weight. In Nigeria, the reverse obtains: just a few months after becoming a commissioner, minister, governor, president, the lucky fellow puts on weight and exudes a palpable aura of well-being and relaxed opulence which were non-existent around him or her before the assumption of office. Compare the pictures of top political office holders in the newspapers before or just after they got to their present positions with what they look like after about six months or one year in office. The difference would be very clear. Political offices in Nigeria serve the interests of oppressors, the godfathers and kingmakers. For the ruling elite, together with hard-core wealthy capitalists, Nigeria is a source of stupendous personal wealth, even if it means denying the vast majority of the citizens fundamental human rights like food, shelter, clothing, education, health, employment and security. Politics-with-bitterness is ruining the country. It is the grandfather of hatred and violence. Many Nigerians are apprehensive that the forthcoming elections this year will be marred by violence. Those that are pessimistic about the future are not prophets of doom: they are merely reiterating that unless the major political actors in the country totally abandon the winner-takes-all mentality which promotes politics-with-bitterness, fears and anxieties about safety will discourage a sizeable percentage of the electorate from exercising their political right to vote. Whatever party any politician belongs to, he or she should remember that politics is about people and that no political position, not even the presidency, is worth all the trouble, the violence and loss of lives that had occurred in previous elections. We are all Nigerians, irrespective of our political, ethnic, and religious differences. Politicians should grow up and avoid the silly mistakes of the past. They cannot remain perpetual toddlers, always explaining away their stupidities with the clich\u00e9s \u201cwe are operating a nascent democracy,\u201d \u201cdemocracy is a learning process\u201d etc. Time is ripe now for our democracy to move past the nascent stage; our politicians should stop trying to reinvent the political wheel. The evolution of world history has made available some of the fundamentals of democratic governance. Politics-with-bitterness is certainly not one of those fundamentals. On the contrary, it negates the values that strengthen people-oriented democratic leadership. Once again, we call on Nigerians to reject totally politicians and political parties that have a penchant for lying, dishonesty, persistent uncouth language, and violence. Politics-with-bitterness is one of the reasons politics has been described as a \u201cdirty game\u201d in some quarters. But politics, or any game for that matter, is not dirty; it is bad politicians that have polluted politics. People of goodwill should stand up and rescue it from the pollutants, \u201cnew barbarians.\u201d Concluded. Related",

        "author": "Helen OvbiageleWoman Editor",
        "text": "By Helen OvbiageleWoman Editor Madam,\u2019\u2019 said a colleague, giving me a piece of paper,\u201d read this article I printed out from the internet and tell me if this incident of cooperation and kindness from the Police, is possible in our country.\u201d The incident took place in south London recently, when a surgeon who was trying to get to work to carry out an emergency operation, was helped by police after he became stuck in traffic caused by the snowy conditions which struck Europe this winter. According to the report, \u201ca police sergeant was on routine patrol in the cold weather, when the medic stopped him at about 9.45 a.m. The doctor said he was needed urgently at St. Heller Hospital in Sutton to deal with a patient who was in a critical condition with internal bleeding. He had already spent two hours attempting to complete the journey from his home in Purley after being called in to perform the operation. Using sirens and with lights flashing, the officer managed to get the doctor to the hospital in a marked 4\u00d74 police vehicle in six-seven minutes,\u201d the police spokesman said. I pondered over the article for a minute, trying to find an appropriate answer to my colleague\u2019s question. Can our police be that kind and cooperative to a member of the public who\u2019s not a VIP and who they don\u2019t know? I couldn\u2019t see it happening, but still\u2026 \u201c\u201dIn the first place,Madam,\u201d said another colleague,\u201dour police won\u2019t be out in such inclement weather for any reason, let alone to help find a solution to an emergency.\u201d \u201dIsn\u2019t that because they\u2019re not well-equipped to deal with an emergency of that sort?\u201d I tried to defend. \u201cI\u2019m sure that if they\u2019re equipped with the right sort of vehicles and gadgets, they would be of more use to the public. Besides, I don\u2019t think they\u2019ve been trained to really be there for members of the public in all types of situations. They\u2019re confined to fighting crime only, so they can\u2019t help in other areas. It\u2019s left to the government to include in their training, other areas of looking after citizens. This is what happens in many Western countries where apart from fighting crime, the police are acquainted with the residents in their area and can render the relevant help when required. If there\u2019s anything unusual in the neighbourhood, residents would notify the police immediately. The rapport is that close ..\u2019\u2019 \u201dMadam, you could be right. That could be part of their training to help and protect the citizens. The police are indeed their friend. I wonder why we didn\u2019t copy that from our colonial masters.\u201d Good question. Just how many Nigerians are bold enough to contact the police on any matter? Very few, I\u2019m sure. The other day some residents in an area of Lagos, woke up to find a Mercedes car parked near the gates of one of them. Three days later, it was still there. No-one had the courage to call in the police because they felt they would be detained and asked to say what they knew about the car. Their people would then have to come pay to get them out again, someone said. So, residents passed on their way though they were aware their lives could be in danger, since they didn\u2019t know the contents of the vehicle. A week later, the residents woke up to find that the vehicle had been taken away. Lack of good interaction between our law enforcement agencies and us, is not the only area that is crying out for a reform. Many Nigerians who are old enough to know, would tell you that our pre-independence days were the good old days in our lives. The country didn\u2019t have all the money we get from oil these days, but there was clean drinking water, health care was brought into the homes of the citizens as there were sanitary inspectors who ensured that you kept your house and environment clean. Stagnant water and ponds were regularly sprayed with insecticide to stop malaria-carrying mosquitoes from breeding. We\u2019ve been told that malaria kills more people than AIDS in this country. How effective are mosquito-treated nets? Healthcare in this country is dismal. A week ago, a trailer driver who drove his vehicle from Lagos to Port Harcourt was knocked down by a bus as he alighted from his vehicle. Onlookers rushed him to a hospital, but they were turned away because money had to be deposited before he would be attended to. Same thing in several other hospitals he was taken to. He died in the process. A colleague of his said his life could have been saved if he had got medical attention immediately. This is a common story all over the country. Our rulers are aware that that sort of thing cannot take place in the Western countries which are a playground to them. Hospitals, whether private or public, are bound by law to provide emergency healthcare to anyone brought to them, be it a citizen or a visitor. Later, the government would look into it, and bear the cost, if necessary. Some countries insist that visitors get a health insurance before they\u2019re given a visa. Life is that important over there. What about the state of our roads? The media houses have cried themselves hoarse in a bid to draw government attention to these death-traps. Feeble attempts are made to pacify them for a while, but soon, the shoddy work is washed away. No-one seems to know how to fix roads well in Nigeria, in spite of all the experts we have in the field. Right now, the number of private educational institutions is threatening to surpass that of the government, and some of the proprietors at one time or the other, were in a position to move government institutions forward by ensuring qualitative education. They didn\u2019t. Why? Now they are running private institutions and charging high fees. Of course, it\u2019s only the elite that can afford to send their children there, if they don\u2019t want to send them to Western countries. So, what about the common man? Are his children condemned to our decayed educational system? This is something that needs to be urgently addressed this new year to check the half-baked students that graduate from our institutions every year, so that we don\u2019t create more social problems for ourselves. Some top companies prefer to recruit people with overseas higher education. That would leave those who went to our government institutions on the unemployment heap for many years. But, who can blame these employers? They know the quality of education the government offers. We\u2019re now in an election year. Power should be in the hands of the voters. That is, the man on the street. During campaigns, they should exercise their rights and ask those who want to be voted for, what they will do about health, the roads, education, social amenities, security, unemployment, etc, and be ready to monitor, without fear or favour, their achievement when they come into power. There should be a law which allows constituents to recall a member of parliament who is not performing. I\u2019m sure some activists can lobby and help draft this up so that it will be fair and transparent. This time round, let\u2019s settle all disputes about the elections, before those who are declared winners are sworn in. No cases should be entertained after they take their seats. This is a year of decision for NIGERIA. Related",

        "text": "By Josef Omorotionwan THIS writer belongs to the first generation of educated people in his family. In retrospect, it is now clear that we did not encourage our old father enough to do what he was already doing very well. Otherwise, he would have long possessed a large reservoir of his collector\u2019s items \u2013 cards and more cards, both voters\u2019 and party membership. Even where the cards had changed colour considerably because they were stored away in a calabash near the fire place, the old man had no problem identifying the party membership cards as they bore the relevant details: They were at various times in Zik\u2019s party, which had the cock as its symbol, as contrasted with Awo\u2019s palm tree. We were soon able to assist in identifying the current voters\u2019 cards and there was therefore no need to seek outsiders\u2019 help in picking out the relevant cards on election day. The cards were many and that left the impression that they had always been in the habit of approaching every election as if the world was just beginning afresh. Just imagine how much we are now throwing into a single exercise of registering ourselves to go and vote. And this is how it has always been. At the theoretical level, there has always been a very robust argument in favour of good voters\u2019 register. The Deputy Senate President, Ike Ekweremadu almost got trapped on the wrong side of the argument, when he said that INEC\u2019s bill for the registration was on the high side. His colleagues shut him up. He should have realised that \u201cno amount is too much to spend in the nation\u2019s quest for electoral transparency towards ensuring that Nigerians\u2019 genuine votes count in 2011\u201d. In his time, the Professor of pharmacology, Maureen (oops, Maurice) made a very strong submission to the effect that a flawed register that would lead to disastrous consequences far outweighs any production cost. And behold, his register was neither flawed nor disastrous, remember? It succeeded beyond measure as it captured many of our people in the Diaspora \u2013 the Mohammed Allis, the Mike Tysons, the Barack Obamas and the rest of them. Wao! This time around, no body wanted to be caught on the wrong side of history. Everyone sat up. Both the National Assembly and the Executive branch of government took two crucial actions almost in a single day: As the Electoral Act 2010 was being signed, the supplementary appropriation of N87 billion was being credited to INEC\u2019s account, quick, quick. It is now clear to all the stakeholders that all casualties of war do not necessarily occur in the battle field. We must abhor the direct loss of lives as well as the opportunities to meaningfully wage battle against electoral defects in this country, if we must move forward. Our intentions are very good but the battle has not even started. There are still many rivers to cross. INEC has just released a time table, which indicates that the elections proper will kick-start with the national and state assemblies on January 8, 2011 and end with the presidential election on January 15, 2011. This time-table is based on the assumption that all is well with INEC but we all know that all is not yet well. We have not lost sight of the fact that we are still in court over whether the President should assent to the First Amendment to the 1999 Constitution or not. An aspect of the court\u2019s decision here could throw the entire time-table off balance. Our Judiciary is not helping matters much, either. Elsewhere in the more civilized democracies, this type of constitutional interpretation is given very accelerated hearing and disposed off, possibly within 48 hours but not in Nigeria where the Judiciary still prides itself that a few days to the end of their four year tenures, the contestants who felt cheated in the April 2007 elections still have their cases limping between the Elections Petitions Tribunals and the almighty Appeal Courts. Who will ask them? Evidently, the Nigerian Judiciary is living in a world of its own. It is only in an election year that we suddenly remember that any electoral reform, which does not include the reform of the Judiciary, is like a train without an engine. At this age where the rest of the world is going beyond digital, it is only in this part of the world that we still have Judges sentenced to the hard labour of recording court proceedings and judgements in long hand. If we were to get serious for once and devote an amount even substantially less than N87 billion to the reform of our courts, we are sure that not only would our election cases not be abandoned in the deep freezer sometimes for upwards of four years, we should also have paved way for the cure to the awaiting trial syndrome in our courts. Above all, we would have a Judiciary that can separate electoral offenders from pick pockets and other petty thieves. Apparently, what we have now are half measures for solutions to nagging problems. Who is really stampeding us into making more unpardonable mistakes? We want to know. Even granting that all is well between INEC and the law, vis-\u00e0-vis the controversy surrounding the constitutional amendment, by the just released time table, INEC is already walking the tightropes. Here, a combined reading of Sections 10 (5) and 21 of the Electoral Act, 2010 is necessary. Section 10 (5) of the Electoral Act stipulates that registration of voters, updating and revision of the register of voters must end 120 days before an election. We know one Madam who would have snatched the microphone from the legislators when they were enacting this law. Why should they be using must, must, must? Any way, the important issue of registration of voters, which has not even started now, should end by September 8, 2010, just a few days from now, for the National and State Assemblies elections to hold on January 8, 2011. However, Section 21 of the new Electoral Act provides for an ample injury time. It is by the grace of this section that claims, objections, verification, correction and final certification of the Voters\u2019 Register can continue until 60 days before an election. What this means is that we are embarking on this important exercise purely on injury time. It will be very interesting to know how many wrong steps we are entitled to in the entire process. We have already used up some of the chances. As an instance, Section 31 (1) of the Electoral Act, 2010 demands that the notice of an election must be issued 150 days prior to that election. What this means is that the notice for the January 8, 2011 elections should have been issued since August 11, 2010! Well, with Divine help, we may soon get to the point where it may not be necessary to continue to look at the forest, particularly when we shall see what we have done with the woods. At least, we are already used to the Doctrine of Necessity. A good one issued at the appropriate time will atone for all the defaults. There is hope that even if all the elections do not hold in January 2011, God can still make a way for us. The more things change, the more they remain the same. We have a system that has been able to throw up a good material. From the euphoria and popular acclaim that have greeted the appointment of Prof. Attahiru Jega as the INEC boss, one is almost certain that no other method of selection would have produced a better Chairman. We have no quarrel with the top. At the level of the National Commissioners, a few reservations were raised and they were promptly corrected. We hear that a heavy baggage of liabilities of some sycophantic staff, which Iwu wanted to foist on INEC on the eve of his departure, has been dismantled. That\u2019s credibility building. But that should not be all. INEC should know that its success is the Nation\u2019s success. What this means is that INEC should quickly develop zero tolerance for rotten eggs. After all, one rotten egg can destroy the entire basket. We are worried that some people who belong to the prisons are still walking our streets as free men. And they are still allowed to hold the Aces to our elections. We could as well go and look for Anini (remember the criminal king pin who shook Benin City to its very foundation in the 1980s) and Lamidi Adedibu (who had a personal registration centre in his Ibadan abode) to come and hold sway as Resident Electoral Commissioners in some of our most important States? Why not? Such could induce the freest and the fairest elections but we are quickly reminded that where they create a credibility gap, their results will not be accepted. So, in the final analysis, we still need the three elements: free, fair and credible. It can\u2019t be done otherwise. Related",

        "title": "2011: No time for a long debate",
        "author": "Kunle Oyatomi",
        "text": "By Kunle Oyatomi Last week, I drew attention in this column to the dilemma which the electoral law appears to have placed on our collective aspiration to have a free, fair and credible election come 2011. And since the beginning of this week, that issue has become a full-blown debate with INEC leading the discussions. First, the commission asked for more time to do a good job; and in an interactive session with political party leaders, INEC\u2019s chairman was specific that the commission would need up to April to get a good job done. Very strictly speaking, what Jega is asking for is at variance with the constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria. The law is specific as to when the elections can hold (and it is liberal enough to give a time frame of not earlier than150 days before swearing-in of the new administration). To be on the safe side of the law, Jega\u2019s request cannot be granted as things stand without a breach of the law. So the law has to be altered to provide a legal framework under which INEC can operate. The big question however is whether the National Assembly will be able and willing to do this within the shortest possible time in the next couple of weeks. If it can, good enough; but if it cannot because of the process involved in constitutional amendment, then we have to accept the inevitable; that May 29th handover date would be impossible. And by inference, the tenure of the current administration will be extended. But the alternative to such an extension (which a lot of people apparently don\u2019t want) is to ask INEC to proceed with its tight schedule, which is a terrible risk we will be ill-advised to take. Jega\u2019s statements and body language are apparently to warn that he will not accept responsibility for failure, if because of the law, he is forced into a tight corner from where a \u201cgrade A\u201d result would be impossible to achieve. The gentleman has a point. The ball therefore is now strictly on the politicians\u2019 court to see through this danger and act decisively. Jega has flown a kite; He is saying that if we can get the law to allow him a lee-way to manoeuvre around the problem, he can deliver satisfactorily but outside the strict framework of the law. And, honestly speaking, there lies the problem. The legalistic-minded people out there will have none of this kind of infraction on the law, even if the outcome of the elections were universally accepted. The other side of this position is the national interest. Is it reasonable to bend the law just a bit in the national interest, if that would guarantee a credible, free and fair election? Especially so because the extension of time requested by INEC would still be within the handover date of May 29th. This is not a decision that INEC can take, hence the commission is asking all stakeholders to come up with a decision. But even if a decision is taken in the national interest short of amending the constitution, we would be counting a whole hell of a lot of legal controversy. Are we ready for this? There are no easy answers to the plethora of questions this phenomenon throws up. If for instance we say INEC should go ahead with its plan (rather suggestion) to conduct the election in April, can we justifiably say such action conforms with legality? And if, in the strictest sence of the word; it doesn\u2019t, can we say the election is all the same credible? One can go on and on. The problem is huge, we must be frank; and to all intent and purpose, if we must operate from the safe side, it may seem best to do the right thing straight away, which is: amend the law to lay a solid foundation for a very truely credible election. Whatever sacrifice would be needed to get this done should be preferred to laying the basis for discord and controversy in the future, by going ahead to do anything illegal. This is my honest opinion. I appreciate the longing of Nigerians to have this election properly done. My sympathies go to the people who desire change, however, in a democratic environment there is only one way to go: the way of legality. So let us work as hard and as expeditiously as possible to put the entire process within the legal framework. It is the shortest and safety way to go. This problem is resolveable and the country has the capacity to do so. What we may not be sure of is whether there is the will to get things done quickly. That is a question the political class would have to answer; for it is as much in their collective interest as it is in our national interest to get 2011 right. Failure is too bizzare to contemplate; and it stares us in the face if we fall short of doing the right thing. The debate is now heating up for good. Everything has been jolted by the prospects of failure, and nobody will be ready to take responsibility for making 2011 fail. So, if the question of legality will abort credibility of the elections, then let\u2019s fix the legal aspect of it before we proceed. Whatever then suffers as a consequence of that exercise could only be in the national interest. Related",

        "author": "Ochereome Nnanna",
        "text": "By Ochereome Nnanna THE rigging of elections is a more complex operation than meets the ordinary, untutored eye. The objective of rigging election is to ensure the processes are artificially orchestrated to result in the emergence of a particular, premeditated individual as the winner. It entails placing obstacles in the way of those who are contesting against the favoured individual. Election rigging is not just about the snatching of ballot boxes on polling day, or the thumb-printing of stolen electoral papers in the homes of party big wigs. It is not only about falsifying results for the favoured candidate, or the use of thugs to prevent the participation of the supporters of his opponents. These are the cruder, more bare-faced acts of election rigging. The \u201cfiner\u201d variants involve the use of state resources and agencies to force an outcome in favour of the premeditated candidate. During the eight years that Chief Olusegun Obasanjo contested elections, we saw it in full spate. We are beginning to notice signs that the strategy is being mobilised in favour of the undeclared presidential ambition of President Goodluck Jonathan. During the 2003 and 2007 elections, the presidency applied delay tactics in the release of funds to the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC). The last-minute release of funds led to confusion and critical shortages of electoral materials. Happily, we cannot say the same thing for the INEC of today under Professor Attahiru Jega. It has received from the Federal Government all the money it requested in double quick time, though the presidency did raise suspicion when it briefly sat on the INEC request for funds. One of the ways that the presidency under Obasanjo also tried to rig the election in favour of the late Alhaji Umaru Musa Yar\u2019Adua, was to prevent some interested presidential aspirants from contesting the elections. He was able to stop Dr Peter Odili and a number of other strong aspirants from contesting the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) presidential primaries. Obasanjo had also set up the Professor Ignatius Ayua administrative panel of inquiry to indict some aspirants based on the fact that they were being investigated by the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC), then under the chairmanship of Malam Nuhu Ribadu. However, this ploy flopped because the Nigerian Judiciary rose to the occasion and ensured those who sought redress in the courts of the land were not sent home disappointed. As a result, former Vice President Atiku Abubakar was able to force his way to contest the presidency under the ticket of the Action Congress (AC), while other \u201cindicted\u201d contestants for the governorship seats, such as Rotimi Amaechi of Rivers, Chief Theodore Orji of Abia, among the others, also rode the chariot of court victories to thwart Obasanjo\u2019s plots. This time around, the presidency under Jonathan briefly toyed with the idea of raising the dust-covered Okigbo report on the spending of the Gulf War oil windfalls to stop former military president, Ibrahim Babangida, from contesting the presidency, which Jonathan is hotly eyeing in 2011. Obviously, the Attorney General of the Federation and Minister of Justice, Alhaji Mohammed Bello Adoke (SAN) decided to drop the idea, in view of the court victories of Atiku and company. Suddenly, government said it could not go to court against Babangida with the copy of the Okigbo report in its custody. The pro-zoning PDP state governors have not been similarly spared. The EFCC has been let loose among them. Every single state being overrun by the Commission\u2019s operatives are those not yet painted yellow (Jonathan\u2019s colour) by ThisDay newspaper\u2019s insightful \u201cpolitical trending\u201d charts. In other words, they are the states whose governors have not yet bought into the Jonathan presidential ambition because of their stand on zoning and other issues. EFCC says the charge of being used by the presidency to run after the President\u2019s opponents is \u201cblackmail\u201d. That may be so, but it does not disprove the allegation. Some of these cases that Farida Waziri\u2019s operatives are now huffing about are years old. The case of Amaechi\u2019s men is of particular interest. It was reported over two years ago. After only a brief play in the media the matter was laid to rest (as usual) until Dame Patience Jonathan returned from Rivers State where she had an open face-off with Governor Amaechi. The following day, EFCC suddenly remembered the two-year-old case and pounced on Amaechi\u2019s men. They also visited Imo, Jigawa, Bauchi and other states that have withheld their support for Jonathan. Waziri\u2019s newfound enthusiasm to fight corruption was a well packaged stimulus. Just a few weeks ago, kites were flown in the media that she was on the firing line. It was reported that foreign partners in the war on corruption felt she was unserious and incompetent. They would stop their financial assistance to the EFCC unless she was removed. Jonathan, who is eager to remain in the good books of the international community, seemed about to act. Names had been dropped as her possible replacements. Then, suddenly, Waziri started copying the Nuhu Ribadu style of fighting corruption. She started making frequent, populist statements in the media, saying that she would ensure that corrupt politicians would never be elected. How she would achieve that she never told us. She chose to keep it \u201cas a strategy\u201d. Then, just like Ribadu did, she unleashed her operatives on anti-Jonathan states, sparing states whose governors are for the president. Watch it. As soon as these governors start supporting the president, Waziri\u2019s enthusiasm will cool again. You will say I told you! When you intimidate those who do not believe in you to support you, you are already rigging an election. It is what the French love to call d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu. Already seen. It is Obasanjo all over again. Related",

        "author": "Kunle Oyatomi",
        "text": "By Kunle Oyatomi Since 1998, the Nigerian Political environment has been evolving into one huge theatre of the absurd. And one of\u00c2 the most hopelessly absurd event then was the choice by the Northern Political elite of who the Yoruba Presidential candidate should be in 1999. IBB, Danjuma and the rest of the northern elite ensured that it was their Yoruba candidate, Olusegun Obasanjo, who became the President in May 1999. To tell how much the Yoruba people distrusted Obasanjo at the time, he was rejected in his own ward, where he lost to Chief Olu Falae who was the undisputed Yoruba choice. The North enjoyed themselves unfortunately at the expense of the Yoruba Nation, who are still living with the pain of that political travesty till this moment. Obasanjo eventually stabbed his northern benefactors in the back and then went ahead (after the failure of his third term bid) to re-enact the same absurdity that brought him to power: he personally and single-handedly made the choice of who the northern president should be in 2007, and the terminally ill Yar 'Adua was his candidate. In his desperation to force through his choice\u00c2 for the north, (as the north bulldozed Obasanjo on the Yoruba nation) he declared the election of 2007 a \"do-or-die affair\"\u009d. Yar 'Adua won, and the world saw it was a fraudulent arrangement. The north couldn't laugh; and when Yar 'Adua passed on, they wept, and they are still in political agony because Yar 'Adua's tenure was billed to stretch for eight years; but somehow that presidency continues albeit without a Hausa/Fulani directly in charge. As you read this, the late Yar 'Adua's presidency is on-going under the leadership of his vice from the South/ South, Dr. Goodluck Jonathan!! But that's not where this absurdity ends: constitutionally, Jonathan as a person is entitled to contest the 2011 presidency; and if he so chooses, nothing stops him from claiming his right to conclude the eight-year tenure of the Yar 'Adua presidency, which was a joint ticket between the late President and himself!! Can you then imagine how ludicrously distasteful and inappropriate this zoning stuff is? That it is still dominating the political debate speaks volumes of our political immaturity. Again, contemplate this absurdity; a group of northern leaders in the PDP are insisting that the zoning nonsense must be the determining factor of who should get the presidential ticket of the party, and has therefore instructed all parties to field only northern candidates pursuant to the dictates of the zoning principle. And, as usual with most of them, a group of PDP leaders from Ibo land are already identifying themselves with the northern position even before Ibo leaders take a definitive stand on the issue. You can only imagine what permanent political enmity would be created between the east and the south/ south if it's leaders proceed to endorse zoning against a Jonathan ticket. Besides, there is a palpable tinge of arrogance in the ACF's call to all political parties to field\u00c2 northern candidates for the 2011 presidential race, as if imposing, or attempting to impose discredited zoning formula (which is essentially a PDP affair) on all the political parties of this country. If we must tell ourselves the truth, zoning is a deadly political instrument intended\u00c2 to permanently institutionalize mediocrity in our social, political and economic life. The idea of zoning is practically the same as \"Federal Character\"\u009d which is the prime cause of our institutional and bureaucratic collapse in Nigeria to date. Besides, the same deadly poison of zoning is at the core of our educational policy thrust, which down grades entry qualification for students in so-called \"educationally disadvantaged states\"\u009d (whatever nonsense that means) to allow them into higher institutions of learning with lower grade, while students with higher grade are denied admission. We can see the effect of this absurd policy on the quality of products from many of our universities today. Yet we refuse to learn, and the political class is making it\u00c2 look as if the best approach to politics is to lower the standard for \"unqualified\"\u009d people to be permanently in power. The more the proponents of zoning insist that it should be central to electing the next president, the more they give the impression that what is critical in the political life of this country is not WHO the President is, but WHERE he comes from. And, to be polite, that is dumb indeed. If 50 years after independence, the quality of mind \"\u201cthe WHO- plays a secondary role in the process of electing a Nigerian President in the 21st Century global community, as against the WHERE he comes from, then this country may have for ever lost its claim to leadership in the African Continent, and indeed the black race world-wide; and by extension would be under threat of dissolution. What Nigeria needs as a matter of urgency is a president with the mental, intellectual and spiritual capability and capacity to do the job and move this nation forward. Any thinking contrary to this, or any approach that fall short of this standard is a recipe for chaos, and a vote for retrogression. This is exactly what the relentless call for adherence to zoning is tantamount to. NB:\u00c2 \u00c2 \u00c2 \u00c2 This column will be unavoidably off this site\u00c2 next Saturday. It will resume later. Thanks for your understanding. Related",

        "author": "Kunle Oyatomi",
        "text": "By Kunle Oyatomi IN 1979, Nigeria had a wonderful bouquet of presidential candidates to choose from. Not a single one of them, however, was as rich as, or have access to unlimited finances as the two current front runners in the 2011 presidential race \"\u201d IBB and Goodluck Jonathan. Forget that the latter is yet to throw his hat into the ring, the delay is strategic. Already, though, both names are somewhat controversial. Before 1979, Nigeria had hope and promise. Its ethos was respectable, its people were affable, its politics was vibrant, purposeful and sometimes entertaining. Its economy, even if precarious, was said to be buoyant. Life was tolerable, people were happy. At least, all of these, in contrast to what obtains now, was something near paradise. Chief Obafemi Awolowo was not a multi-billionaire, neither was Dr. Nnamdi Azikiwe, Alhaji Waziri Ibrahim, Alhaji Aminu Kano etc; but these people ran a presidential race that took them to the nooks and crannies of Nigeria to seek the people's vote. The major logistical problems they had were transporting themselves across the country with their campaign troupes, feeding and accommodation. And these, at that time, were ten times less expensive than it is today. They did not have to worry about bribing the voters. The political process was defective \"\u201d yes, but it was not as corrupt as we have it today. That made it possible for us to have alternatives in making our political choices. This era ended for Nigeria in 1983 when the military struck and put the country into the reverse gear, into retrogression. Today we have a country practically gasping for survival, and the question of who is best suited to be in charge is not being efficiently addressed. We are bugged down in controversy over two possible candidates who we have as much inclination to accept and reject with almost equal passion right across the country. Incumbent President Jonathan and ex-military President Ibrahim Babangida have so over shadowed the political discussion, their names are beginning to choke!! Where are the alternatives? If you look carefully into the kernel of the consensus that is emerging from the on-going political debates, the general feeling is that we need a breadth of fresh air in presidential candidates that are detached from the rot of the last decade, and the corruptive influence of the past military era. If this prognosis is correct, then it is curious that six months before the 2011 elections we have not yet seen a serious alternative candidate being promoted for the presidency come 2011 presidential poll. We are busy talking about those we do not want to be president and why, and we are ignoring the real issue as to who or the number of those that could be alternative choices. I am not too sure if the reason is not psychological. It would seem that we are hiding behind a phenomenon we cannot address, to lash at the monster we are utterly afraid of, and helpless against \u2013 the monstrosity of a monetised political environment. Money is the very basis of life in Nigeria. You live if you have it; you subsist if you don't have it; but you become a king, an idol, a power-monger and broker if you have it in the millions, billions trillions; then you will rule the Nigerian world even if you are an idiot. And catastrophically for our country, those in charge of our wealth are not the most brilliant, or at best they are criminals, and evil-geniuses. These people have transformed the political culture here into such a money-crazy affair that except you are in the billionaire class, there is no way you can compete for the presidency of Nigeria. You will need truckloads, planeloads or shiploads of naira to buy support and votes, as well as buy the security agencies and INEC to \"win\"\u009d. Not to talk of the grassroots, how many hundred of millions you are expected to give away to rented crowds and mobilisers \"\u201d all of these amount to the \"logistics\"\u009d you have to budget into your expenses for the campaign. And if you lose, you perish. Behind this intimidating prospect, it would be easier to talk about the candidate you don't want, than the one who is likely to do better on the job. Many people have tried to join the billionaire class in order to work from within them to change the system, but they have ended up being sucked into the maelstrom of corruption. We know a good number of them who cannot sound correct anymore because they have been compromised. The issue therefore is not why a credible alternative is not on offer yet, the real question is who will foot his bill? There is no responsible and credible Nigerian today with integrity and patriotism who have the money to contest the presidency and win. He must either belong to the billionaire club or is sponsored by those who have a vice-grip on this nation's wealth. And you know what to expect from such a candidate. This is the futility of trying to look for credible alternative candidates outside the rich and ruling political class. Back to 1979; Nigeria's political system at that time was so open and vibrant you didn't have to be rich to contest. Professor Ambrose Alli was not rich yet he won in old Bendel State. Alhaji Lateef Kayode Jakande won Lagos while Bisi Onabanjo won Ogun in spite of the fact that both were relatively poor journalists, but they contested and won in a political environment where the people who wanted them to rule contributed the money for their campaign. Similar situation replicated itself in the victory of Balarabe Musa in the old Kaduna State. Above all, Shehu Shagari who became President in 1979 did not use his money for the contest. His people and party supporters funded his campaign. It was a pleasantly different environment entirely. As far back as 31 years ago, Nigeria was as politically mature as America on that premise. The money Barrak Obama needed to win the presidential election in America last year was contributed by voters who believed that he was the right candidate to move America forward. Today in Nigeria, the very opposite is the case since 1999, and it is getting worse. We are already hearing of individuals being mobilised with N250 million to seek support for a candidate being proposed for the 2011 presidential election. In 1998, we heard of those who gave an initial sum of N300 million to a candidate. We will never know how many billions of naira are being wasted by presidential candidates at all levels. But what we do know is that increasingly, the Nigerian presidency is up for sale, and only the highest bidder and/or \"spender\"\u009d can win. In this type of atmosphere, to think and talk of a credible alternative to what's already on offer is far too tortuous to imagine. Presidential election for 2011 is a minefield. There will be \"casualties.\"\u009d Related",

        "author": "Ochereome Nnanna",
        "text": "By Ochereome Nnanna THE new Chairman of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), Professor Attahiru Jega, got me worried when he gave the \"salvaging\"\u009d of the Maurice Iwu voters register as an option. In his maiden press conference on Thursday, July 22, 2010, he had hinted that his Commission would have no choice but to attempt a salvage of the old register if the N72 billion required to acquire the machines and logistics for the creation of a credible and computerised electoral register and database was not granted. It is gratifying to note that, in his avowed determination to ensure a free and fair election next year, President Goodluck Jonathan has already granted the request for the fund without snipping a kobo off. But suppose the President wanted to play pranks or the fund was not readily available, I shudder at the readiness of Professor Jega to settle for the second option of \"salvaging\"\u009d a register that was used to conduct elections which the whole world has thumbed down. Compromise was not the picture painted in the minds of Nigerians by those who were rooting for the appointment of Professor Jega as the Chairman of the INEC. I was not looking forward to Jega giving the slightest gap to anything that could result in only 10 per cent success rate, especially in the all-important compilation of the voters register. The fact that any attempt to salvage the Iwu-created voters register could only result in a 10 per cent rate of success should have rendered that option unworthy of being considered as an option. Jega should simply have asked for the money \"\u201c and time \"\u201c to give us a credible election. That would have bolstered his image as a decisive electoral umpire who will not accept half-measures. We hope we do not have on our hands a university professor who will allow himself to be derailed by the many pressures that lie ahead of him. Another issue that worries me is his insistence that \"May 29, 2011 handover date is sacrosanct. Please have no illusions about it\"\u009d. I am worried but I understand. The INEC is bound by the Constitution, which confirms that on May 29, 2011 the tenure of those elected four years previously must come to an end. Ordinarily, this should never be an issue for debate. But we are faced with an extraordinary circumstance in which as a nation we lost three months to an ailing president, during which governance was at a virtual standstill. We also lost momentum due to the removal of Professor Iwu and the long period it took for his replacement to be sourced. The nation has no regrets for the removal of Iwu, but if that had not happened, the electoral calendar released by Iwu on Wednesday, March 17, 2010 had intended that the review of voters register would start on April 26,\u00c2 2010. Little did Iwu know that three days after this date he would be asked to embark on a compulsory terminal leave. I said the nation had no regret for getting rid of Iwu because he merely intended to \"review\"\u009d his nonsensical voters register when what we need is a fresh, sanitised one. If Jega is able to start the compilation of a voters register in August as he would like to, we would still have lost four months to political instability. Credible and acceptable election is a sine qua non for a stable government. Without the foundational issue of credible voters register being settled, there is no way an acceptable election can ever be held. Having been squeezed into a very tight corner by this problem, added to the complication of a new constitutional provision that compulsorily brought the 2011 polls forward to January from the old April date, Jega resorted to begging the National Assembly to amend the Electoral Act of 2006 to reduce the time for the registration of voters from 120 to 60 to squeeze out more time for a new registration exercise to be completed. Even if the Assembly grants this request there is no guarantee that more complications will not emerge, as the electronic machines have not been ordered from the manufacturers, neither have the personnel who will man them been trained. The task of preparing for a credible, foolproof election in 2011 is not such that the paring of a few weeks off the remaining period can suffice. We must run away from the Nigerian style of waiting for the last minute before we start major national assignments, such as preparations for elections. If we force ourselves to hold elections in January 2011, we might spend another four years suffering the crises of legitimacy that hounded the late President Umaru Yar' Adua to his grave. We should either postpone the coming into effect of the First Amendment to our 1999 Constitution to enable INEC enough time to conduct the election in April 2011 or even restore October 1 as the day a new government is sworn into power as was the tradition before General Abdulsalami Abubakar unilaterally shifted it to the curious May 29 date. I am in favour of the latter option, which many well-meaning Nigerians and civil society groups have clamoured for. All it requires is for the National Assembly to, once again, summon the \u2018Doctrine of Necessity\u2019. We have many things to gain and nothing to lose. October one is our National Day. May 29 is nothing. This period will give Jega and his team enough time to plan and give Nigeria the best election they can. It will also allow President Jonathan to prove himself as an achiever, failing which we will be at liberty to look elsewhere for his replacement. In Nigeria we rush every major event. That is why we never get it right. Related",

        "author": "Kunle Oyatomi",
        "text": "By Kunle Oyatomi I wonder what there is that makes a number of people feel optimistic that Nigeria is on course for change. I have tried to figure it, but there is nothing there to convince me!! Relative peace in the Niger Delta? I can't put my money on it. What is brewing behind the facade of amnesty has volcanic potentials. It is early days yet, but the deals don't add up. On both sides, all the cards are yet to be put on the table. How that inspires hope and confidence I cannot fathom. Democracy? That's a long way off. What we have on ground is a quarter kilometre\u00c2 to one-party dictatorship. We say we are a Federal Republic of Nigeria, but there is nothing federal about the system which has mutated within half a century from a federation to a military-style unitary dictatorship. It explains the mentality of the federal government over the creation of local government, in Lagos State and the hopeless dependence of states on the federal for their survival. The very fundamentals of liberal democracy are scant in this \"democratic\"\u009d experiment. At\u00c2 the apex of it are free and fair elections. But that is the aspect we least understand how to manage except in its travesty. Two years on since the last elections, cases are still in court unresolved as a result of the magnitude of fraud that characterised that 2007 elections. Even when Mr President admitted that the process of his own election was significantly flawed, he is still there enjoying the trappings of the office. And as if that was not odd enough, the fellow, who conducted what stands undisputed as the worst election ever held in the history of this country is still there at his duty post shamelessly congratulating himself for doing a dirty job. If the \"body language\"\u009d of the government and the ruling party is anything to go by, there is nothing to suggest that Professor Maurice\u00c2 Iwu won't be the same person to oversee the 2011 elections. Wouldn't it be pathetic in the circumstance for any one to hope that the 2011 polls will be credible? Or how else should one explain the way the government has treated\u00c2 the Justice Mohammed Uwais recommendations on electoral reform. Since 2007, governance in Nigeria has been stagnant, except for a few places (like a drop in the bucket), we have not experienced governance in the real sense of the practice. Sure, we have heard about budgets. There has been \"massive\"\u009d disbursement of funds from the federal level and the states, but we can't put more than a finger on what these monies have been used for. Throughout the country, infrastructural collapse is wreaking havoc on\u00c2 economic activities. The economy itself is comatose, and there is misery in the country as we have never been unfortunate to experience. But against this backdrop of human suffering, there is a visible and disgusting parade of affluence by the wealthy, and the political class which has already distabilized society. Anger is building throughout the land, but the grave yard \"silence\"\u009d all over is like a building vulcano. Law and order? Ask victims of armed robberies and escalating incidents of kidnappings. None will understand when you talk about law and order. For them as well as for most of us, law and order have long since broken down; we are simply lucky that chaos and anarchy haven't taken over.\"\u009d Most of us who are keeping track of these developments are shocked by the incapacity of state apparatus to\u00c2 contain the worsening state of insecurity all over. And before we could come to terms with these violence, the country was confronted with the madness of Boko Haram. Over 800 people have lost their lives from the mayhem of that insurgent religious group in parts of the North. Perhaps the incurable optimists amongst us would say the worst of Boko Haram is behind us. Sorry, they are not reading their history properly. Boko Haram is not over; the name could change, but the phenomenon is still festering, and I would venture from hindsight to say that we are not done yet with the madness of religious insurgents in the north. It is a familiar tape on the reel. It will play again. But what disturbs me very deeply is that those in charge of the affairs of state have practically abandoned their responsibility to govern. They are rather engaged in a \"rat race\"\u009d for succession, or the \"second term\"\u009d sickness. The concentration of\u00c2 office holders (especially the executive heads of governments) is now on how to secure a second term, or pick a successor who will shield their \"crimes\"\u009d after leaving office. As a result, governance in the land is right now in abeyance. We are not far from that fateful year of 2011. The situation in the country at the moment, which gives us inkling of what the immediate future could be like, is not good to put it bluntly. If the political class and the powerful continue in their \"devil-may-care\"\u009d attitude and proceed to violate the nation's conscience as callously as they did in 2007, there is real cause for concern that the state may unravel. Those in government should\u00c2 concentrate on governance. The lack of it in Nigeria today puts all of us at great risk, including the politicians themselves. Related",

        "author": "Helen Ovbiagele",
        "text": "By Helen Ovbiagele Travails and trials around the world this year has made 2012 a most unpopular year for many. If it were within the power of some to cut its tenure short, they would readily do so. Poor 2012! \u201cAuntie, mum, 2012 has been quite a hell of a year,\u201d said a cousin\u2019s son, when we were all discussing current events. \u201cLet it just pack up its packages of tears, woes and fears, and get out of our lives. What a year!\u201d \u201cHow come?\u201d I asked in surprise. \u201cI think we should consider this a very good year for your family. I know there\u2019s been some challenges like in other families, but right from the beginning of the year, members have been recording successes and pleasant events. Glory be to God. I wouldn\u2019t have expected you to regard this year a bad year. God has been kind and gracious to us all. Let\u2019s be grateful.\u201d \u201cCoz, that\u2019s what I keep telling him. We have a lot to be thankful for in our little corner \u2013 for life, health and food. But he seems to consider himself the general manager of the entire world, and he takes very personally, whatever distress there is out there. I think that\u2019s wrong. Why carry the burden of the whole world on your shoulder when you\u2019re not the Creator? I don\u2019t know why he thinks this is the worst year ever. I agree that there\u2019s been many tragedies for quite a while now, but is the year to blame? Good things have happened too. We have to be thankful.\u201d File photo \u201cMum, I sure am grateful for all the good things God has put in the way of this family, but that doesn\u2019t mean that we should omit to feel the tears and woes out there. I know that leap years are supposed to bring more bad news than other years, but 2012 has been exceptionally vicious in dishing out woes all over the world, particularly in Nigeria. This no longer seems the Nigeria that I was born into. It\u2019s been woes after woes in all areas of life. This year can\u2019t end too soon for me. It\u2019s like living in a dark tunnel.\u201d I\u2019m sure many people share this young man\u2019s view of our current life. Still this year has not been all gloom. It has brought great joy to many too, but since bad news tend to have a bigger impact on our emotions, we\u2019re overwhelmed by them. Nigeria has had its share of this year\u2019s woes. Things we never expected to happen to us in this country, have been happening at an alarming regularity, and citizens and the government are completely helpless! God has immensely blessed Nigeria, but what has been happening this year is beyond our understanding. The rich keep getting richer, while the poor keep getting poorer. This alone has brought on huge problems. Then the destruction of lives! Even if one\u2019s family has been spared, news of calamities has a way of taking the joy out of living as you begin to fear for your own security and survival. This year collapsed buildings have taken people\u2019s lives and rendered many homeless. This is in addition to the destruction/loss of their property and belongings; many of which can never be replaced. In several States across the country, terrible floods have wreaked havoc and whole families have become refugees, living on handouts of food and clothing from the government, NGOs, private companies and helpful citizens and some foreigners. Erosion has deprived some communities of their means of livelihood. These natural disasters have always been there, but they have been more intense this year. Still, we thank God for survivors. That unfortunate plane crash mid-year which took all the lives on board, and some lives on the ground plunged the nation into mourning. Numerous fatal road and boat accidents occurred almost every month throughout the year. Hospitals in the cities are full of accident victims, and with the dismal healthcare at the disposal of the masses, many may suffer permanent disability. In a country where there\u2019s no social security system to take care of the poor, the unemployable and the unemployed, you can imagine what future awaits such people, as some will have to be heavily dependent on their families for life! Violent attacks and escalated heinous criminal activities have brought much sorrow. Security and peace are so fragile these days that anything can tip the country overboard. We\u2019re believing God to come to our aid. But then, there have been worse and more frightening misfortunes around the world \u2013 suicide bombings, earthquakes, mudslide, blasts in mines, violent hurricanes, air, sea, mountain and land accidents, crimes which shocked humanity, etc. God, in His mercy, spreads these things around and no country is immune from them. There\u2019s no longer a safe haven in the world that you can run to, in order to feel safe and at peace. We can\u2019t blame the year 2012 for all these happenings. Neither can we commend any year for being good to us. Years are just periods and what happens in them are either God ordered, or human ordered. Most of the evil on earth is perpetrated by human beings. I\u2019m sure that if the year 2012 can feel and talk, it would express great anger at all the horrible things we\u2019ve done during its tenure to defile it and tarnish its image. We should blame ourselves for most of the evil in the land. God has put in us the notion of what is right and what is wrong, what pleases Him and what doesn\u2019t; but He has also given us tremendous freedom of choice. Barring natural disasters, wrong choices are what are turning the world upside down and making it hell for everyone. That young man was right to be concerned about the misfortunes in the world, because even if we live in opulence and in fortified residences, our hearts would tremble whenever we hear of blasts and violence. We should not only feel concerned about victims, we should do all in our power to help. But most of all, we should ask ourselves what can be done to avert these occurrences and make life more pleasant and peaceful in our country once more. On the part of our rulers, there should be alertness and preparedness, and a great ability to manage crisis. We shouldn\u2019t be caught napping when turbulence comes. When hurricane Sandy swept the West Indies and the eastern part of the U.S., recently, notably the State of New York and its environs, causing devastating floods that took lives and property, the government swung into action at once, sending help by land, water and air. In earth-quake-prone areas over there, families are advised to pack emergency bags in readiness in case one occurs, and they have to head for shelters. I know of a family who has been in this state of readiness for over thirty years and they\u2019ve had no need for those bags. Still, they remain in their garage, anyway. As we wait for 2012 to end, let\u2019s all sincerely ask God to save Nigeria and give us better times with more good news than bad. This is the only country most of us can confidently call our own.

        "author": "Helen Ovbiagele, woman Editor",
        "text": "By Helen Ovbiagele, woman Editor We were crawling along at snail\u2019s speed in this terrible traffic build-up when a group of hoodlums, weaving in and out between the lanes, tried to frighten motorists into pulling aside with cries of \u2018flat tyre\u2019 \u2018smoke from your bonnet\u2019 \u2018your moto don catch fire\u2019 etc. No-one took the bait and stopped. Instead we wound up our windows and prayed that the traffic would move faster before darkness set in and nasty things would begin to happen to motorists and other commuters on that road. We thought we had escaped one group, but a second one suddenly surfaced, with one of the hoodlums banging on the roof our vehicle to attract our attention, before moving on. There were five of them. Four of them looked in their early twenties, but the fifth looked middle-aged. In fact, he looked like a father among the others. \u201cWhat\u2019s this? Did you see the Baba among those boys?\u201d asked one of the ladies in the vehicle with us. \u201cYes, I did. I was wondering what he was doing there. He should know better than go about, trying to extort money from commuters.\u201d \u201cIsn\u2019t that disgraceful of an old man like him? At his age, he should be cleaning up his act and repenting of his sins before his exit. Instead he\u2019s piling on more.\u201d \u201cExcuse me, driver, please stop,\u201d said another lady in the vehicle. \u201cI want to get down and talk to that old man. I want to tell him that mature people of our ethnic group don\u2019t lower themselves into behaving like an area boy. Stop please, driver.\u201d \u201cMadam, I can\u2019t stop o! I don\u2019t advise you talk to such people, ma. They may be carrying knives. Who knows, they may even be high on something and are ready to attack anyone who challenges them,\u201d observed the driver. \u201cJust leave them alone.\u201d The rest of us supported the driver\u2019s view, and reluctantly, the lady agreed not to pursue the matter. \u201cBut how did such an old man end up among hoodlums?\u201d asked someone. \u201cWhat went wrong? He couldn\u2019t have started out in life like that. Isn\u2019t he ashamed to be seen in such a company at his age?\u201d \u201cBy the way, what becomes of area boys when they\u2019re no longer young?\u201d I asked. The driver supplied the answer. \u201cMadam, they supervise the younger ones. You see them sitting around in sheds or under the trees, watching while the younger ones are extorting money from people. They\u2019re everywhere. Maybe that old man has no boys to supervise, and that\u2019s why he\u2019s taking part in this operation.\u201d We discussed this a bit, and wondered what sort of upbringing and parenting the old man must have had, and what he\u2019s passing on to his own children. One of the toughest jobs on earth is parenting. In our culture, being a parent is even more important than being a spouse. Having children is so important to us that some marriages break up when there are no children. Not so long ago, when the man was the main provider in the family, his relatives could go throw out his wife for failing to produce children. They felt then that it was a disgrace if a man didn\u2019t have children, and they wouldn\u2019t want their son/brother\u2019s time wasted on an \u2018unfruitful\u2019 wife. We may dispute this, but many people here, particularly the first-timers, marry mainly because they want to have children and become parents. It\u2019s only when we find ourselves single in later years, when we\u2019ve had children, that we may think of marrying for companionship. Much as we love to have children, good parenting has become quite a problem. After satisfying societal demand of producing children, some parents shirk their responsibility towards their wards as they come overwhelmed by the time, efforts, money and emotional support that it takes to raise them into well-adjusted citizens. Some feel that their responsibility ends with providing material things for the child, and they take very lightly the issue of raising children to be courteous, clean, have good morals, a sense of responsibility, good character, and the ability to make the right choices. Some expect a child to develop all these on his own. No-one is born with a good/bad character. We acquire it here on earth as we observe and emulate other human beings around us. With many parents no longer making it a point to watch closely their children\u2019s behaviour, these ones turn to their mates for direction, with all the attendant danger. Sometimes, this may not be entirely due to lack of parental guidance, but the need to fit in with their mates. We know how important it is for us as young people to fit in with our age groups. Thus you find a child from a seemingly strict, respected and responsible background acquiring bad habits and morals. They go to places they know are wrong for them to go to: they lie, they\u2019re rude and insolent, they cheat, steal, experiment with drugs/sex and play truant. Sometimes, they don\u2019t even have to go far to acquire these habits, as house-helps, neighbours, friends, and even family members lead the child astray behind the backs of his parents. No parent can boast of having a child who\u2019s perfect in all areas of life, but if you make it a point to be heavily involved in your child\u2019s life right from babyhood, helping to mould his character by guiding him to do the right thing; correcting bad behaviour firmly but with love and explanation, praising/rewarding good behaviour; and generally showing him that you\u2019re there for him, you could win his confidence which could make you his confidant. This is easier said than done, as most young persons could be rather secretive about the goings-on in their lives and despite the attention they get from the home, may feel more comfortable confiding in other people \u2013 house-helps, friends, neighbours, etc. Confiding in a responsible teacher is not that bad since teachers are meant to regard their pupils as their wards. That\u2019s why it\u2019s good for both the home and the school to liaise closely to honestly monitor the child\u2019s movement and guide him. We shouldn\u2019t rely on school reports brought home to us, but should attend Open day and other school activities to talk to the teachers. Mobile phones have made communication much easier, so, we should take advantage of this and get in touch with our wards\u2019 teachers on a regular basis, to politely find out how they doing at school. For some parents, intense monitoring and guiding of their children is added stress to an already over-stressed life that we experience in this country, and they fear for their own health. Parents have my sympathy, but if we want a better society to live in and leave for our descendants, we should not only monitor our children closely and guide them well, we should show good examples for them to emulate. Bad parenting is the remote reason for most of the ills in societies all over the world, as young people are left to their own devices, and they spiral out of control, endangering lives and property. When all adults in our culture acted as parents to the young people around them, correcting any perceived misbehavior, we had a more orderly society. Sadly, this is fading fast, as we copy the western world where in the name of political correctness and freedom, young people cannot be corrected without falling foul of the law. We must not allow that here. As we celebrate the first day of 2011, let\u2019s resolve to embrace better parenting, and encourage values which will make our country safer and more pleasant to live in.

        "text": "By Iretiola Doyle I stole that line from Sound Sultan \u2013remember his hit track 2010? It underscored the many failed promises of our leaders. Remember our nation was to undergo a major transformation and everything was supposed function well \u2014albeit miraculously! Outside of \u20182000\u2019 and \u20182010\u2019, I don\u2019t recall a year (in this millennium at least) that was so anticipated, so talked about, so \u2018prophesied\u2019 about\u2026 I would say it more than lived up to expectation. All over the world, right here at home; drama. Everywhere you turned, there was something going on. If it wasn\u2019t a natural disaster, it was a couple of people holding entire nations to ransom. Look in another direction you will find some of these same people literally at each other\u2019s throats because contrary to the saying (at least where these ones are concerned) there is no honour amongst thieves. If it\u2019s not that, it\u2019s someone walking into an elementary school or any other kind of public place and killing five year olds; innocent people because he was \u2018disturbed\u2019 and having a bad day. Right here at home the blood flowed freely right through the year\u2026 I doubt that a month went by without an incident, be it an act of terror or as a result of human negligence or just by some freak accident that cost the loss of human lives. Not to mention the daily waste of resources of every kind. At a point it seemed relentless, and as each one landed like a body blow you curled into yourself a little bit more trying to hide from the images and the sheer knowledge of what\u2019s going on literally in our backyards. Without a doubt there were moments of glory both home and away\u2026 isn\u2019t that what life is about; the good and the bad? Thing is, as I sit here in its closing days looking back, it\u2019s all a haze. Other than those that hit close to home, the kind that made you inhale sharply, pause and think, as I look back all I can feel is a wave of gratitude that given everything that has happened one is still standing. Life and limb intact; and still in stewardship and in some cases, able to multiply the things that the Almighty has placed in ones hands. I wonder though if that isn\u2019t unhealthy and kind of selfish\u2026The fact that one has become so inured to the destruction that exists all around\u2026 what about the greater humanity? There has to be more to it than getting up in the morning, putting one foot in front of the other, taking care of one\u2019s \u2018business\u2019 and ensuring that a least the ones that exist in your immediate circle are taken care of\u2026 abi? Perhaps that\u2019s another reason to be grateful. That we are still here standing, means we\u2019ve got a little more time; to do better, be better, contribute more, give more, learn more,expand, renew, regenerate, restore\u2026 And that is my prayer for you this season\u2026 that there be a restoration and regeneration in every area of your life and in our nation. I pray that you have more, so you can give more. Merry Christmas! Related",

        "text": "By Iretiola Doyle OH. MY. WORD!!! The Super Eagles are actually soaring again! They pulled it off! Frankly speaking I was expecting them back home the first week. This is one occasion where I actually relish eating my words and I am shameless enough to bask in the reflected glory of communal success. I can say this now without the fear of being lynched that I was hoping the Burkinabes would take it. Why? Theirs was such a romantic story\u2014from a history of very little or no progress to beating some of the biggest names on the Continent to get to the finals. And to think that they would have done battle with \u2018Almighty Nigeria\u2019 to lift it\u2026 ah! It\u2019s the kind of material fairy tales are made of. What can I tell you? I\u2019m a romantic; bite me.But no worries my country winning felt just as great and had its own romantic twist; 19 years? It\u2019s been a long time coming! The last time I saw such hunger and determination on our sidewas during the \u201994 or was it \u201996 Olympics when Nigeria took the gold. The team was made up of young hungry (for glory) boys that included Sunday Oliseh. Speaking of which, what a transformation! Insightful, articulate and concise\u2026 talk about re-inventing one\u2019s self\u2026 a far cry from his stubborn headed, naughty days on the field. Yup! All in all, it was a good day for Nigeria. And to boot, something really good has happened for a change that President Goodluck can actually take credit for! You may ask what he had to do with it; na you sabi! Success has many parents abi you know no? See me wey dey talk now! I\u2019m told Coach Keshi(nuff respect) did the smart thing and selected players for their skill and fitness as opposed to \u2018popularity\u2019? I wonder if anyone else did anything different. I\u2019m trying to find out if our win was a fluke or a result of due diligence. It is said that once the grace of God is upon you all things begin to work for your good. It doesn\u2019t matter what is, anything you lay your hands upon will prosper and even your \u2018mistakes\u2019 will work to your advantage\u2026. Dare we believe? If in spite of our usual slipshod attitude towards things big and small, could this gift so early in the year be an indication, a sign that our time for restoration is here? Could it be that the Lord our God has finally heeded the cries of His people (who we know have never stopped praying) and an unprecedented amount of grace released to us? Is 2013 the year? When things begin to turn around for the collective regardless and in spite of ourselves; a year in which we can do ALL things and ALL things begin to work out for our good? Fellow Nigerians! Let us collectively use the Super Eagles as a point of contact for every aspect of our great Nation. As the Eagles have caused us to soar again in the area of sport, so shall we begin to soar again in every aspect of our co-existence. The glory that has been restored to our nation via this singular feat will spread like yeast and permeate every aspect of our nationhood. Everything that is run down will be raised up again in the Mighty Name of Jesus! Everything that the cankerworm ate and the locust years tookaway, shall be restored back unto us a hundedfold! To 2013\u2026. Our year of limitless possibilities! Related",

        "author": "Helen Ovbiagele",
        "text": "By Helen Ovbiagele When on Friday December 7, 2012, I read the headline \u2018SENATE KICKS AGAINST EXTRA 9 billion naira for Vice-President\u2019s residence\u2019, in one of our national dailies, I felt very frustrated and disappointed, and I began to doubt if our rulers are really aware of the myriad problems Nigeria faces, and how to combat them. Or perhaps they do know, but don\u2019t know which are of utmost importance to the nation. With the numerous aides and advisers that our leaders have around them to help them carry out their duties successfully and creditably, one would expect they know precisely the state of the nation at any given time. These advisers are meant to feel the pulse of the masses and advise their bosses correctly, so that these bosses can carry out their duties in ways that would benefit our citizens. I doubt if erecting residences for our leaders at massive costs at a time when government claims it has no money to improve our welfare in meaningful ways, is of great benefit to us at present. How can this bring relief to a nation where unemployment is very high as more and more industries are folding up; bread winners in families are losing their jobs; young people are wearing out their shoes, pounding the pavements in search of elusive jobs (some commit suicide out of despair while some take to crime and prostitution); pensioners are owed several months of their meagre monthly pensions, and several die every year during the rigorous verification exercise. File Photo Security is of very great concern these days, but we learn that our law enforcement agencies are no match for their opponents because they lack the sophisticated and high-powered equipment the other side has. At any given time, one after the other, or sometimes at the same time, teachers, doctors, nurses, university staff and other government workers are on strike. Reason? Government has reneged (yet again!) on its promise of paying the agreed salaries and benefits, and improving their lot. We have many efficient and qualified medical personnel, but there\u2019s brain-drain there because of poor pay and lack of adequate hospital equipment, including steady power supply and reliable generators, with which to work. Patients suffer lack of care and some deaths occur. It is one thing to fight tooth and nail to win at elections, or to be appointed into a position of authority, and it is another to know precisely what to do with the power given, in order to fulfill the purpose for which you were chosen/appointed. I salute the courage of Senator Smart Adeyemi, a former national president of the Nigerian Union of Journalists, for his remark after paying an oversight visit to the site of the project at Aso Drive. The paper said that he noted that such a huge sum of money was uncalled for especially at a time when most Nigerians cannot afford three square meals a day. His remark, though sincere and echoing what many Nigerians would say on the matter, is courageous because he belongs to the ruling political party. He easily could have kept quiet \u2018in order not to upset those who put us there!\u2019. The nation will now wait to see what the end of the matter will be. Governance and law-making are supposed to put citizens first in their decisions. I may be wrong, but to me, our Vice-President seems a humble and down-to-earth person who wouldn\u2019t insist on having an official residence for his position constructed at such huge costs when he\u2019s very aware of the situation of the average Nigerian. Even though the mansion won\u2019t be his personal property, and there\u2019s no guarantee that it would be completed on time for him and his family to occupy during this his term in office; and even if the project may have been on ground before this present administration came into power (?), I don\u2019t think it\u2019s prudent for us to spend billions of naira on such a project at this point in time. Someone told me that it\u2019s because of the security gadgets that need to be installed that the cost is so high. Fine, but the most effective security is the one that God provides. He will keep safe those whom He will. But let\u2019s make sure that citizens, particularly the masses, have qualitative lives. Maybe we can easily afford this sort of project in future when unemployment is down to almost zero level, and we\u2019re counted among the developped nations of the world, with much improved healthcare, educational system, roads, water supply, and working social services. I learnt from the news report that the project which is being handled by the Federal Capital Development Agency, who requested for a further nine billion naira, has already gulped seven billion naira! Now, this is a huge sum of money, by any standard, at least to many of us. To ask for a further nine billion naira, seems outrageous to me when there are so many masses-aimed projects which are begging to be executed. Most roads all over the country are still quite bad and dangerous. The Lagos/Ibadan road, we\u2019re told, is merely being repaired for traffic at Christmas, and has not been awarded for rehabilitation to any construction company, as we believed. The Lagos/Benin road is still quite testy although repairs are going on still, as on some other roads in the country; thanks to the efforts of the energetic current Minister for Works who seems to be aware of his duties and commitment to making our roads more motorable and safe. We hope lack of funds won\u2019t halt these road works. Fuel scarcity inched back into our lives in September. We\u2019ve been told that de-regulation of pump prices is inevitable, and we shall have to pay more for fuel in this new year. We all know that bad roads and increase in pump prices mean hefty hikes in food prices, as farm products rot away on the farms because the farmers cannot afford the cost of transportation even to the local markets, and those who are able take their products there at huge costs, just have to increase their prices in order to break even. Market people add their own overheads too, and by the time that yam or plantain gets to your table, you feel the pinch in your pocket. Right now, doctors are on strike, yet again, in hospitals across the nation. This means that even the poor healthcare services we have in these health institutions, are no longer available to the common man. Even the poor now have to borrow money to send their sick to India for medical attention. Power supply has worsened in recent times, and on the days power is supposed to be on in your area, it\u2019s low current for half the time, and no power for the other half. Small scale industries and self-employed artisans are left helplessly idle most of the time. Senator Adeyemi spoke of three square meals. Sorry, Senator, only the very rich can afford to eat three meals a day these days. Many families can afford only the evening meal, and that\u2019s with the contribution of children who have to go hawk on the streets to help financially in the home. Our rulers should wake up and be alive to their responsibilities towards the masses. They should put the interests of the masses first before their own personal interests. We don\u2019t want a revolution, do we? HAPPY, HEALTHY, SUCCESSFUL AND SAFE NEW YEAR TO ALL READERS OF THIS PAGE. AMEN. THANKS FOR READING IT. Related",

        "author": "Tonnie Iredia",
        "text": "By Tonnie Iredia Only 3 days ago, Nigerians crossed over to a new year from one that was characterized by lies, deceit and self-denial. Historians would no doubt remember the year as one where fake patriots denied, all year through, the obvious vanishing life of their nation. It was a year in which virtually everyone could see and feel the pains of the nation; yet majority of the people chose to deny the obvious by pretending that all was well or would soon be fine. In reality however, neither the idea of a nation-state nor the essence of a government was discernible. Although our bastardized constitution provides that the welfare and security of the citizenry shall be the primary purpose of government, the subject is not in any way our official priority. Unlike what happens in viable nations where government is organized to put the sanctity of life above every other thing, Nigerians always rationalize the daily deaths of their compatriots. Those who blame government for not tackling Boko Haram early enough may have a point but a stronger point is its failure to rally the people against insurgency. As soon as avoidable deaths began to happen, government should have led the entire nation in doing nothing else other than stopping the trend.Being experts in blame game, we were unable to galvanize our people and totally mobilize them against the subject. Unfortunately, because ours is a nation where no one comes forward to bell the cat, each of us rallies round what touches only him. That is the fate of our North East Zone that has been under fire for some time now. While the affected are languishing in pain and grief, the rest of us still spend ample time on parties and merriments. The point becomes clearer when we compare our reaction to insurgency with our national reaction to Ebola. The latter was swift because we all saw that each of us was facing imminent danger Insurgency on the other hand, has been restricted to virtually one zone. Accordingly, what happens there hardly pricks our national conscience. While many Nigerians in some parts were enjoying cross-over religious services and other forms of celebrations on New Year\u2019s Eve, 7 people were killed when a bus exploded in a village close to Potiskum, the commercial nerve of Yobe state. The bus according to reports went up in flames from multiple bomb blasts that killed all its occupants. On the same day, a female suicide bomber was killed as she tried to enter a military barracks in a place called Bolari in Gombe State. On New Year\u2019s Day proper, another suicide bomber blew himself up outside the ECWA church injuring several people. Although the incidents are not as grave as previous ones which claimed hundreds of lives, they serve to remind us of the unending grief in parts of our country which we appear to have grown to accept as normal Painfully, those who are mandated to protect our people do not seem to see the task as fundamental. Instead, their disposition suggests that a more important assignment is how to win another election supposedly for the purpose of protecting the ordinary man. Rather than urging governments to live-up to their mandate, our elite class is more bothered about the possibility of election violence in 2015. Interestingly, we all know from history and from emerging political threats that violence in 2015 will happen. As my people say those who want to prevent war must first of all arrest disagreements. Otherwise, those who have said nothing about the zero-sum nature of our political system where the winner takes all, should expect that in such a struggle for power, candidates will resort to winning by whatever method and weaponry? Professor Bolaji Akinyemi\u2019s imagination that holding the 2 Presidential candidates accountable for the actions of their followers could stop election violence is not feasible. His suggestion cannot even reduce violence let alone to stop it. Akinyemi may have meant well but the disposition of some followers which may never be known to the leaders could be overwhelming as those who hope to get appointments if a particular party wins often become \u2018holier than the Pope\u2019 notwithstanding party plans and decisions. Under the circumstance, to apply vicarious liability to criminal law as Akinyemi prescribes is not only unlawful but unworkable in a developing society where politics is the major national occupation. That is why internal democracy remains a victim of Nigeria\u2019s democratic practice-a situation in which a man who becomes a governor uses the position to acquire stupendous wealth with which he easily displaces his own mentors in any contest! It also explains why politicians are able to render our electoral body inefficient or impartial-a situation which makes the distribution of voters\u2019 cards more tedious than voting itself which is the high-point of elections. During the heated debate on increased voting centres, one official of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) explained that the increase in the North was because INEC had no evidence on paper that people were moving away from the area. It is pure deceit because as the Jigawa State Governor, Sule Lamido recently testified, the tension in the North is \u201cso palpable that many concerned northerners have opted to relocate from their homes until after the next general election\u201d. With so many uncared for internally displaced persons all over, did the governor make a new point? If not for self-interest, why are legislators afraid of e-voting? But for self-denial, why is no one condemning the fielding of candidates at elections for primordial reasons? Why for instance, did the All Progressive Congress (APC) drop a tested achiever like Babatunde Fashola just to fulfil a Muslim-Christian ticket? Is it not for the same reason that we ignore our very best while seeking to implement any policy? We submit that whether Christian, Muslim, Northerner or Southerner; our troubled nation desires only who can BEST solve our problem and move the nation forward. Where ever he is from as well as his religious beliefs are inexpedient Related",

        "author": "Rotimi Fasan",
        "text": "By Rotimi Fasan IT was and still is the single most talked-about issue in Nigeria in the last one year. Although its existence predated the Goodluck Jonathan administration, insurgency has been that single elephant of an issue that has dominated the room of national discourse in the last one year. It brought activists campaigning for the return of the Chibok girls out on the roads of Abuja on Christmas day 2014. It was on the lips of the hundreds of thousands of Nigerians that have been displaced from their homes in different parts of the north-east, and their families. The Pope didn\u2019t forget to mention it in his Christmas message. And it would continue to dominate news about Nigeria until an end is put to it. 2014 would be best remembered by Nigerians as that year in which marauding bands of castaways took on a national army and all but succeeded in putting it out of business. Not only was the Nigerian armed forces routed in series of encounters with the insurgents, many times members of the armed forces perpetrated acts of sabotage against their own organization, became mutinous and turned their weapons on their own commanders. The discipline for which professional armed forces are famous around the world; the focus that gave the Nigerian armed forces a place of pride in Africa, was nowhere to be seen among those sent to the frontline to confront the insurgents. Poorly motivated and without the right or required resources to take on Shekau\u2019s killers, the soldiers became their own worst enemies. 2014 must have the record for the highest number of soldiers sentenced to death for unsoldierly conduct. And except things get worse (which nobody prays for), its record would be hard to beat for a long time. The tragedy that made the past year, perhaps, the worst for the Nigerian military started with the abduction of over 200 school girls from their school in Chibok on 14 April 2014. For many weeks following this unfortunate event, the Jonathan administration didn\u2019t seem bothered to say nothing of knowing how to go about ensuring the rescue of the girls. But after many weeks of passing the buck and feeding Nigerians outright lies about the true condition of the school girls; indeed after Abuja could no longer turn a deaf ear to global outcry to bring back the girls, the government finally started rousing itself from its deathly slumber. It made some gestures in the direction of seeking assistance from the rest of the world to rescue the girls. But after these apparent attempts at rescuing the girls, nothing worthy of report to Nigerians has since happened. Surely, since the initial abduction in April, far more girls, their brothers, sisters and parents have been either abducted, displaced from their homes or killed by the same wanderer groups President Jonathan promised to bring to account on different occasions. As 2014 went into the ages, our dear president was still making promises to bring back the girls, improve the economy and make life more secure for Nigerians. Scene of the blast. The next few weeks are bound to be very busy and interesting. With the February presidential elections within sight, this government can have nothing for Nigerians other than its strategy to fight for its existence. A multi-billion Naira war chest is already in place. While oil prices continue to crash and state governments are struggling to meet their wage bills amid a belt-tightening regime of austerity imposed by Abuja, President Goodluck Jonathan was able to raise over N21 Billion in one single day to prosecute the war to keep his office. There is no doubt that more money would still be raised up to the eve of the election and beyond. Nigerians are perhaps now getting some insight into where and for what the billions of Naira that have either been declared missing or unaccounted for at the NNPC are. Of course, President Jonathan wouldn\u2019t be the first to rake in so much electoral funds in questionable circumstances. But Nigerians would have expected him to copy the most appealing and admirable qualities of his predecessors, not their excesses. After six straight years in office as president, Goodluck Jonathan ought to be confident enough to run his campaign on the record of his achievement. He ought not to allow any kind of under the table tactics in the prosecution of his reelection bid. But that increasingly seems a taller order than he can cope with. The reasons for this should be clear to any Nigerian. There are no records to speak of in real terms. Much of what the administration catalogues as achievements are nondescript efforts it should be ashamed of. On the question of security, for instance, this administration has failed abysmally. Otherwise, we would not be talking of 2014 as Nigeria\u2019s year of insurgency. Which is another way of saying that the past year was one of insecurity. The violence at the level of actual hostilities was just without compare. It was no less so at the systemic level with many state governments now unable to meet their obligations by their workers and contractors. What then is there to cheer about this administration beyond the chest-thumping rhetoric of its ministers among other professional praise-singers and lackeys? The past year was what it was because of the incompetence of the drivers of our national locomotive. They have failed to live up to expectation. Their incompetence threatens to bring the national house down on us all. A president that came into office on a groundswell of national goodwill, at least in the southern part of this country, has squandered so much of it that its goodwill account is now in overdraft. If Nigeria must look to a better future it cannot continue at this level in which a national government rolls out the drum to celebrate the fact that its petroleum minister, in her capacity as Nigeria\u2019s representative, became the first woman president of OPEC. If this is the kind of achievement that the Jonathan administration feels happy celebrating, then Nigerians have very little to look forward to from it even if they cannot be sure that the alternative might be better. It surely doesn\u2019t look like it could be worse. If anything, things could get better. Providence has been kind to President Goodluck Jonathan as it has been kind to all of those who have had the privilege of ruling this country. That privilege must not be turned into a right or, indeed, a matter of sentiments in which anything but ability is allowed to determine who becomes Nigeria\u2019s president in February 2015. Goodluck Jonathan may be a good person. He may want the best for Nigeria. But his personal goodness or well wishes cannot substitute for competent and able leadership. Related",

        "author": "None",
        "text": "It is happy news that the New Year 2014 has brought its freshness into an atmosphere contaminated by the foul saga of letter-writing that pervaded the last few weeks of last year, 2013. The hope is that 100 years of amalgamation of Northern and Southern Provinces will rekindle hope in a new and stronger United States of Nigeria.At the time when arrangements are on for a useful National Dialogue and when politicians are re-sketching their plans to capture power in 2015, it is necessary to re-examine the real strategy for economic reconstruction and political stability. The strategy is not new to readers of this column; it has been discussed several times.It may not be too late to start to sort out our priorities from the confusion of the past. First, action should be taken to strengthen the import substitution industry, so as to ensure its survival against foreign competition and also for it to be able to produce enough for home demand and for export. The measures required are prevention of smuggling, substantial reduction or complete eradication of import duties on plants, machinery, spare parts and raw materials which cannot be produced at home. A complimentary policy is that which will stimulate demand for the locally produced goods. Since the lower income groups are more likely to prefer these goods, it would be better to put more money in their pockets by a moderate increase in salaries and wages or substantial reductions in personal income tax and purchase tax (vat). The other group, with high propensity to consume home goods is the old-age pensioners who need substantial increase and regularity of payment of their pensions. The third group embraces those unemployed graduates (after the National Youth Service) who need a form of income to sustain their current level of demand. They should be supported by stipends until they are employed. The next development strategy is the orientation of the domestic industry towards foreign markets. The local beer and malt drinks, textiles, plastic goods and oil and lubricants are common in the West African region either through smuggling or under unorganized trade structures. While serious efforts are needed to provide favorable conditions for growth, stringent measures should ensure that domestic industry responds to the policy of employment generation and the demands of tax payments (as and when due). The old giant stores of old were a sad reminder of lost opportunities through uncoordinated fiscal policy and foreign exchange management. The old giant stores disappeared because of difficulties in procurement and the cost of foreign exchange. Those stores were good avenues for employment of high, middle and lower grades of Nigerians up to the 1970s. The promise of economic diversification is not new to Nigeria except that it has remained a mere executive theory or parliamentary jargons during annual budget sessions. A concrete policy is needed which should be faithfully executed. What is needed is strong determination by a strong leader who will reverse the trend of selling not only crude oil abroad, but also other oil-based locally manufactured products. Nigeria should be an exporter of refined products and not an importer, as it is being observed now. In the area of economic diversification, some are suggesting the intensification of the electronics sub-sector. Because of its requirements of high technology and capital, direct foreign investment would be appropriate, necessary and rewarding. The advantage of direct foreign investment is that it releases domestic savings for other productive uses. However, care should be taken that profits remitted home in respect of foreign investment do not quickly outstrip the annual rate of fresh capital investment as to adversely affect the balance of payments position. As initially pointed out, the problems with Nigeria and its economy has nothing to do with suitable plans but principally, the inability to prioritize, and when the country is lucky to select some good plans, the unwillingness to pursue or operate them to successful ends becomes a major problem. Another problem is the pernicious characteristics of every government (whether federal, state or local) to award multi-billion contracts, especially to foreign firms for road construction. Roads are left until they become death-traps, public buildings are poorly maintained and other forms of infrastructures are left decayed until the time is ripe for juicy contracts. The Road Maintenance Authority would always award contracts for road repairs to several companies instead of directly organizing the road maintenance gangs (like the daily paid workers of old) who would look after the roads permanently and thereby, afford employment opportunity for thousands of unemployed youths who now constitute a menace on the highways. If the Nigerian economy is to improve, it would be necessary to have full or near full capacity utilization in the industrial sector, to ensure increase in techniques and equipment (plant and machinery) to raise productivity; to have technical education, training on the job and communication in simple way and provision of simple implements to raise agricultural outputs in the rural areas. This should be complemented by substantial investments in good roads, reliable railways, power stations and irrigation systems in the arid areas of the North. However, rapid expansion of the economy is possible under a visionary leader who would make sure that the country\u2018s macro-economic policy produces overall stability. Such a leader needs a clear perception of what it takes to have full employment, stable foreign exchange and non-volatile price movements in the economy. In the race to a modern and economically viable state, political and economic analysts have expressed some serious doubts on the suitability of the present structure of the state and local governments in the country.

        "author": "None",
        "text": "BY HENRY BOYO The exceptional performance in Pension administration in the last 10 years encouraged the first ever World Pension Summit \u2013 Africa in Abuja last week. The event coincided with the 10th anniversary of the commencement of the contributory pension scheme in Nigeria. The Pension Reform Act of 2004 was enacted in former President Obasanjo\u2019s tenure to enhance efficiency and address the recurrent challenges confronting pension administration. Indeed, before the 2004 Act, Pension Schemes were grossly mismanaged, such that public sensitivity was regularly assailed with the undignifying sight of distressed senior citizens and other retirees, wearily waiting endlessly, in queues to verify their identities and eventually collect their entitlements from those government agencies which were responsible for disbursement. The unsightly juxtaposition of such horrid spectacles against the background of impunity in the misapplication of pension funds, broke the hearts of many retirees while cutting short the lives of several others. Regrettably, pension fund looters often got away with a slap on the wrist as punishment despite the pathetic social damage caused. The 2004 Act consequently created Pension Fund Administrators (PFA) to ensure judicious management of pension assets; in addition, Pension Fund Custodians, (PFC) were similarly established for the custody of pension funds, while the National Pension Commission (PENCOM) was statutorily mandated to optimally, regulate the sub-sector and also ensure that pension assets are invested in safe and secure instruments. President Jonathan noted, at the World Pension Summit, that sustained policy innovations and meticulous management made possible by the 2004 Act had successfully facilitated confidence and credibility in pension administration in Nigeria, such that the fortunes of pension institutions have transited from a deficit of about $12.9bn in 2004 to accumulated pension assets of over (N4tn) $27.2bn by March 2014. Consequently, President Jonathan, signed the Pension Reform Bill 2014 into law in order to build on the gains of the 2004 Act. The new Act is expected to govern and efficiently regulate the administration of the uniform pension scheme to both the public and private sectors. Thus, the 2014 Act, according to President Jonathan, provides an enabling legal environment, which will facilitate the creation of appropriate instruments with which pension assets can be primarily invested on vital infrastructure and real estate development. Evidently, the estimated N4tn pension assets is a handsome nest egg of cheap funds which could be deployed to improve critical areas of infrastructures such as power, housing, education, transportation and health care nationwide, particularly when domestic funds are largely inaccessible and certainly too expensive as long term loans for such projects with extended gestation. Instructively, successful economies institutionally mobilize their pool of pension funds to address critical infrastructural deprivations while hawkish regulators watchfully restrain the deployment of such funds into the volatile markets of speculation and private equity. Nonetheless, we must be careful not to judge the yield on our pension assets with a comparison of the much higher returns from investing pension funds in risk free government securities, which inappropriately provide rates of return as high as 17%! Thus, it is imperative to ring fence pension funds from the attraction of higher returns from those government sovereign loans which have failed to impact positively on our infrastructure and welfare. In reality, if meticulously managed and regulated in line with the spirit of the 2014 Act, pension contributions would provide a sustainable funding platform for continuous expansion and upgrading of our social infrastructure; however, the pertinent question remains, whether or not the ultimate payment of pensions to retirees would meet their lifestyle expectation of maintaining some semblance of dignity until they pass on. In reality, if PENCOM effectively performs its functions, pension contributions would be invested in safe instruments with relatively modest but steady yields, so that inadequate funding and delayed pension payments with the collateral assault on the dignity of pensioners will become history. However, such facilitated payments system may, unfortunately, still not be adequate protection against the threat of poverty to retirees, as discussions on pension reforms, have so far, ignored the critical issue of erosion in the value of money. Even the ubiquitous market woman, labourer or housewife knows from experience that, a thousand naira would buy so much food items and consumables in January, but if unrestrained inflation prevails throughout the year, the same amount of money would buy less of the same basket of goods in December! Thus, in an economy where the purchasing power of incomes, for example, falls by an average of 10% annually, static pension incomes will systematically command less goods and services; for example, a million naira savings in 2014 may just be worth less than the paper it is printed on in 2024, if average year-on-year inflation rates remain as high as 10%! For this reason, rate of inflation in successful economies is carefully managed below 3% with a five to 10-year benchmark, so as to protect the value of incomes, and also encourage a culture of savings. Indeed, the greater the value of savings in an economy, the greater would be the funds available for investment; conversely, when high double-digit rate of inflation prevails in any economy, people are less inclined to save, and less funds will therefore become available for investment; such scarcity of funds would inevitably impact negatively on social and economic growth. Thus, the retrogressive impact of Nigeria\u2019s year-on-year average inflation rate of about 10% over the years is probably starkly reflected in the weakness of our infrastructural base. Ultimately, economic growth, employment opportunities and enhancement of social welfare and infrastructure will become seriously challenged by uncaged inflationary spiral. So, even if the reformed 2014 Pension Act is perfectly managed, future retirees may, indeed, never suffer undue delays and pains in endless queues before collection of their pensions. Sadly, however, unless our Economic Management Team succeeds in bringing down inflation to international best practice levels of not more than 3%, undoubtedly, pensioners will inevitably suffer severe shocks with the realization that their pension payments have, ultimately, unexpectedly become inadequate to cater for their basic needs, as a result of government\u2019s failure to restrain inflation; sadly, consequently, despite the reforms, senior citizens may still not escape penury after a lifetime of service to their fatherland! Advisedly, however, the systemic surplus cash, which primarily drives inflation and poisons the object of the pension scheme and impedes improvement in social infrastructure, will be better managed when our Central Bank resists the temptation to keep substituting naira allocations for monthly distributable dollar revenue!!

        "text": "By Iretiola Doyle My first article of last year was to be titled \u201c2013: THE YEAR OF IRETI DOYLE\u201d but I thought to myself, how vain! and decided against it. Political correctness aside, there was just a calm certainty in the pit of my stomach, that the year 2013 would be very pivotal and in many ways it was. Professionally speaking, it was some of my best work yet; proof positive being the several nominations, and the handsome best actress trophy sitting proudly on my mantle. It was a pivotal year in many other ways too\u2026some very palatable and in others not so much so\u2026 but *the reality is that each experience, bitter or sweet, brought about a deeper understanding of self, and a greater understanding of how one fit\u2019s in effectively with one\u2019s environment and the people therein. In the dying days the initial feeling was that of relief. Almost as if making it to the end of the year was like grappling one\u2019s self away and out of a myriad of issues and situations like ah! Mo bo! But as you cross the finish line, bent over, hands on knees, head sagging forward heaving, trying to catch one\u2019s breath the uppermost emotion is not fatigue\u2026 but gratitude. I\u2019m grateful not just for \u2018making it to the end\u2019 but for making it to the end well. Indeed, there is much to be grateful for especially if one stops to consider all the other things that could, and did go wrong. We lost many a good people in the last year and as far as the African continent is concerned, with the passing of Mandiba there is a huge vacuum\u2026who else is alive who just by their very existence holds the rest of us to high moral standards as regards nationhood? Who else can stand as a beacon? Ah! E go tey o! At home things were no less dramatic, with political twists and turns that would make a Robert Ludlum novel read like a nursery rhyme! If the repercussion of all the intrigue did not have far reaching consequences, some of them quite personal, it would make for very interesting \u2013 and I must include- entertaining viewing. You know, like watching a particularly vicious tennis match. Alas! this is not sport, and the casualties are real human lives. Personally speaking,score card aside, I am still fully convinced that our President is a man of history and destiny. As to his exact role and the long term effects on our nation; the coming days will tell. But there is no doubt in my mind that he was chosen for this time. May God\u2019s will concerning our nation become manifest. It\u2019s true what they say, that which didn\u2019t kill you, will certainly make you stronger. Anyone who survived 2013 wits and limbs intact should be able to look 2014 squarely in the eye and take it by the scruff of the neck\u2026after all we have seen six\u2026what is seven? This year, I\u2019m taking no prisoners, damn vanity and the heck with shame! I decree boldly: 2014: THE YEAR OF IRETY DOYLE!! I walk into boldly, confidently claiming it as mine, knowing that my Lord has already gone before me making every crooked pathway straight! I declare and apprehend a quantum increase in my seed so that I can be more, do more, give more. May it be so for you\u2026you\u2026 and you too\u2026.in Jesus Name!

        "text": "By Hakeem Baba-Ahmed \u201cDoes a man not know if he has pepper in his eyes? If we forget today, how shall we remember tomorrow?\u201d Nigerian Proverb. THE year 2014 will be significant in determining the future of Nigeria\u2019s democracy and key elements of our national existence. Much of the political re-alignments going on, the turmoil within the PDP and the key issues that will influence the outcome of the 2015 elections will be played out in 2014. President Goodluck Jonathan\u2019s position in relation to 2015 will no longer be a guessing game, and whatever he decides will be critical to political developments and the fate of the electoral process. The opposition will have to take decisions that will make or mar its chances of defeating the PDP and replacing it as the dominant party. Management of the economy and national security will be major campaign issues, and the proposed National Conference will expose the weak links in the nation\u2019s chain. INEC will be closely monitored to see whether it will raise its levels of performance in 2015, or plunge the nation into another crisis following widely-disputed elections. President Jonathan will limp into the year 2014 from a bruising exchange with President Obasanjo which has left both of them the poorer in terms of personal integrity and leadership qualities. President Jonathan has lost on points to a former President who has made a career of sorts in punching leaders when and where they are most vulnerable. The most damaging blows Obasanjo delivered were around President Jonathan\u2019s perceived ambition to run as a PDP candidate in 2015. Tried as he did, Jonathan has not successfully parried the assault on his moral credentials to be another candidate which Obasanjo built upon, following grievances from northern PDP politicians that he has dishonoured his promises. The PDP is already reflecting the fallouts from the quarrels over Jonathan\u2019s ambition, and showing gaping holes in some of its strongholds in the North and the South South. In 2014, President Jonathan may literally be compelled to declare his interest to run in 2015, because the option not to run could be more damaging to his interest. He would be seen as chickening out of the challenge of taking on northern \u201cborn-to-rules\u201d; the Obasanjos and a motley crowd raising alarm that the democratic process and national security will be threatened if his candidature compromises the electoral process. If he does run, it will be on the platform of a radically different PDP, the current one heaving gone through much damage and turmoil. In 2014 and 2015, the PDP will face the possibility of extreme marginalisation, extinction or a resurgence that will set world records. The full damage to its spread and popularity will not be known until after issues over the legality of defected governors and legislators are made clearer. The party will continue to lose grounds in much of the North, and more politicians are likely to leave it if they perceive that a Jonathan candidature will be punished in the region by voters. The party will dig deep into its experiences in manipulating critical political muscle and support, including ethno-religions sentiments, and this will provide it with some islands of resistance against voter hostility and a resurgent opposition. The PDP will also intensify building sympathy and support for a Jonathan candidature in 2015 in the South South and parts of the South East; but on the whole, it is likely to find that ethnicity as an electoral factor has eaten deeper than it thinks. With a poor record in managing the national economy, handling a stubborn insurgency and managing other internal security challenges and crimes; a weak will to fight corruption and a general perception that the nation needs a stronger and a more unifying political leadership, President Jonathan will find it hard to win an election in 2015 on his performance alone. The opposition can make his chances easier or more difficult by the manner it handles its opportunities and challenges. In 2014, it will have to clearly define how it differs from the PDP, in part because of the flooding of the APC by PDP defectors. It will have to resolve deep internal problems within its legacy parties and between them and the new entrants from the PDP who have expectations that may not be easily met. It has to handle issues of party leadership and the emergence of candidates with extreme caution and sensitivity, so that these do not constitute major impediments. It will need to watch its back against the PDP (itself with its back against the wall, but still capable of much mischief); against fifth columnists and politicians with ambitions and warchests that outweigh their respect for the party; and against complacency and incompetence in building strong, national structures. In 2014, INEC will have to plan and organise the 2015 elections under the most challenging circumstances. It is likely to get most of what it asks for in terms of funding, but critical scrutiny of all its preparations will keep it on the defensive. It will need to look very closely at its voters\u2019 register and the integrity of its own personnel. By now, it should have registered on INEC that for every one politician who wants a fair and level playing field from INEC, there are ten or more who are willing and able to subvert it. INEC will be at the mercy of a PDP long used to finding ways around all its weak points, and a much bigger opposition that will yield it very little ground in trust and faith. In 2014, the lines will be drawn largely around a two-party battle in the 2015 elections. Camps will be built around ethno-religious sentiments; massive inducements funded by state resources; actual and threatened violence, tall ambitions and high expectations that earth-shaking results will be recorded in 2015. All eyes and energies will be focussed on 2015 elections. So management of the national economy will suffer. The insurgency in the north-eastern part of the country may capitalise on preoccupation with elections to dig in and sustain its fight. Poverty, unemployment and drugs particularly among youth will be used to lure them as foot soldiers in violent election campaigns. The planned National Conference in 2014 will either be an anti-climax or a dangerous addition to the cauldron. If President Jonathan meets much resistance in facilitating a forum with some bite and legitimacy, he will end up with a collection of Nigerians who will debate issues, cost N7b and produce nothing of value. If however, he insists on creating a forum that will have a semblance of credibility, and he throws into its ring issues such as tenure review, resource allocation, state creation and the legal system, then he will raise tensions and stresses that could threaten the 2014 elections. Either way, Nigerians will watch the National Conference as if the nation\u2019s life depends on it, which, in a sense, it does. Unless it is handled with responsibility and concern for the future of the nation, the National Conference could seriously affect the environment in which the 2015 elections will hold. These elections cannot be postponed or manipulated without plunging the nation into serious and prolonged crisis. In 2014, the nation will celebrate 100 years of existence. In a century, Nigeria went from one of Britain\u2019s largest colonies to one of the most endowed and promising African countries. The nation spent the last half century in efforts to build a nation out of massive inherent and contrived challenges. It failed to do this due to the absence of a leadership that will provide a rallying point to mobilise its huge human and natural resources in building a united country with a strong economy. Ironically, our democratic process, far from producing inspirational and uniting leadership the nation needs, has become a major liability. In June 2014, Nigeria will participate in the World Cup. This will provide one of those rare moments when we are only Nigerians. In 2014, the nation will prepare to elect good leaders in early 2015. If it does not get it right this time, it may not get the opportunity to do so again. HAPPY NEW YEAR! Related",

        "text": "By Babajide Alabi As the old year retires and a new one is born, we commit into the hands of our Creator the happenings of the past year and ask for direction and guidance in the new one. May He grant us His grace, His tranquility and His wisdom!\u201d ? Peggy Toney Horton, Does God Want Us to Be Happy As it is usual, the last two weeks of a year are mostly for reflections and also projection into the new year. 2015 was a mixed bag of emotions for nations and countries all over the world. For some parts of the year, there were celebrations of new developments while in some, the opposite was the case. It was a case of win some and lose most. The 2015 UK and Nigeria general elections both went down with surprises. Against all odds and forecast, David Cameron, the Tory candidate won a convincing majority to form a government. The defeat of the Labour\u2019s Ed Miliband promoted a change in leadership which saw the emergence of a left wing candidate Jeremy Corbyn. In Nigeria, the People\u2019s Democratic Party (PDP) candidate Dr Goodluck Jonathan accepted defeat without any fight, against bookies\u2019 and bloggers\u2019 expectations. And everybody lived happily after, as all \u201cthreats of war\u201d disappeared. However, there is no doubt that in 2015, the art of terrorism manifested more in many places than the previous year\u2019s. Unfortunately, the Europe continent was the hardest hit. In this region, state security personnels were made to work extra for their wages. Despite this, the evil organisations still managed a few dastardly attacks on some cities. The French attacks are still fresh in our minds while the lock down of the Belgian state for fear of attack is not far from memories. Elsewhere, the kidnap and killing of westerners which climaxed in 2014 continued. A British man who became particularly notorious for being the mastermind behind the slaughtering of captured individuals \u2013 Jihadi John \u2013 was reported killed by an air drone in Syria. We all remember him as the heartless man who took delight in showing to the world, via ISIS propaganda videos that he was not a man of feeble mind, and never flinched at cutting the throats of innocent individuals, who were kidnapped aid or charity workers. As a result of the civil war in Syria and Iraq, coupled with the activities of the IS, and rebels, many citizens of this region put their destinies in their feets, and \u201cswam\u201d or \u201cwalked\u201d their ways to Europe. They were joined by other migrants from sub-Sahara Africa also running away from wars, persecution or just a desire for better lives. By mid year, the seas leading to Europe became congested by small boats occupied by individuals of different nationalities, ages and sex. The seas were turned into a sort of boat regatta and needless to say that many lost their lives. Despite the various warnings and stories of deaths on the high seas, it was a risk worth taking by these desperate immigrants. The surviving immigrants who found themselves on the sea sides of European countries were desperate, hungry and sick from many days or weeks of travelling by all means and through all terrains. The European Union was completely taken unawares and some of the member countries could not but show there is a limit to their humanitarian gestures. The countries, encouraged by right wing citizens and groups turned their backs on these suffering immigrants. For UK\u2019s Cameron, these immigrants are \u201cswarms\u201d who had come to devastate the \u201cfarm\u201d, called Europe. His comments on the immigrants were roundly condemned, even as his Home Secretary Theressa May maintained a \u201cstoic\u201d face that UK was not ready to take more that a thousand of the total immigrant population in Europe. She sure knew what she was talking about. The choice destination of these immigrants is Britain, where when successfully processed, they are entitled to some sort of benefits. The government is no doubt under serious strain on the benefits bills of Asylum seekers and families. The radical change in benefits pay outs has not deterred these immigrants from aiming for Britain. While Cameron, May and some EU leaders were foot dragging, the German Chancellor Angela Merkel, came forward boldly to announce her country\u2019s readiness to take a sizeable number of the immigrants. As expected, this move angered the German conservatives, while she lost out in the \u201cpopularity vote\u201d, but above all, she showed she is human. Her efforts have been praised all over the world and this earned her the valued TIME Personality of the Year 2015. The irony of 2015 is that while immigrants were desperately \u201cstruggling\u201d their ways to Europe, some EU member countries, especially Britain, also \u201cstruggled\u201d with keeping their borders locked from inside so the internally radicalised citizens would not \u201cescape\u201d to fight in troubled regions. It was not such a success of an effort on the parts of Scotland Yard, MI5 and other security agencies. Many radicalised people, including families, comprising of children, escaped to fight the \u201choly war\u201d. While the agencies struggled to keep these wannabe terrorists in the country, they no doubt succeeded in \u201clocking\u201d the ones in the UK down. We have been told severally that many terrorist plots have been foiled in the county as a result of good intelligence. Among them were the couple, Mohammed Rehnan and his ex wife Sana Ahmed Khan sentenced to life imprisonment last week. The government believed there are many \u201csmall time\u201d terrorists such as these and if not for intelligence, they would have caused havocs in the country. In all these though, there was good news on October 30 when the last British detainee in Guantanamo Bay, Shaker Ahmer was released after 13 years without charge. Ahmer\u2019s release to say the least was not on a platter of gold. It was made possible by relentless efforts of individuals, campaign organisations and pressure groups. Just as the year was winding down, the heavens opened up on UK to record her biggest flooding in recent times. A large percentage of the country\u2019s landscape was under water. Despite the numerous flood warning alerts by the Environmental Agency, there was little home or business owners could do than sit far away and watch their prized possessions washed off. Realising the enormity of the flood, the government drafted in the army to help in \u201cputting the water\u201d under control. The financial implication of this flood on the country had been estimated at over a billion pounds sterling. This is understandable going by the pictures of neighbourhood totally submerged in rain waters. Sadly, on the New Year\u2019s Eve, an iconic building, the Address Downtown, in the oil rich country Dubai caught fire. There was panic among residents who had been looking forward to the annual end of year fireworks. Sadly the fireworks exercise took place as the 63-storey hotel building burnt in the background. It is 2016, here is hoping that at the end of the year, we shall be writing good reports of it. Happy New Year Related",

        "author": "Tonnie Iredia",
        "text": "By Tonnie Iredia In Nigeria, any claim whatsoever can easily be made to look correct; all that is required is to repeatedly make the same claim overtime and after a while it sticks in the sub consciousness of people. The claim in Benin, the home city of this writer that there is an oracle which has capacity to determine the political direction of the people falls into this theory. The way it works is for a ranking palace chief to aggressively make a political declaration which the gullible assimilates as if authorisd by the Benin Monarch. During the 1991 Edo governorship election, a chief, through the Edo Broadcasting Service, announced that the Oba had directed the Benins to vote for a particular candidate. But for the wisdom of the Court of Appeal which found as of fact that the chief was on his own, the election would have been nullified on account of undue influence. Again just before the 2012 governorship election, another chief, used the same style to make personal gains with his famous \u201cthe oracle has spoken\u201d in favour of the incumbent governor. Incidentally, the prediction that the governor would be re-elected came to pass. The chief actually restated that the loser of the election \u201cwrestled with invincible forces\u201d thereby giving some credibility to the oracle. President Jonathan It would appear that the belief has emboldened the oracle-man to continue to delude the people into accepting that he has the authority of the \u201cancestors\u201d to make immutable pronouncements on political issues. The latest statement credited to the same oracle-man is that the Benin people would not vote for President Goodluck Jonathan because he allegedly removed their son, Chris Ogiemwonyi as Minister of State for Works only to turn around and appoint his former wife, Stella Oduah into the Federal Executive Council. In order not to validate the subsisting fake theory, it is expedient to make the point that the Benins are free-minded people who are known for making their independent political decisions notwithstanding the reverence with which they hold their Oba. It is only those who are unfamiliar with Benin history that may not appreciate the fine, long-standing distinction between traditional power and political partisanship in the Benin kingdom. Where, if we may ask, was the oracle-man during the golden era of Chief Humphrey Omo-Osagie, the leader of the Out-Edo political party whose members and followers overwhelmingly voted against the candidates of every authority including those of the government party-the Action Group? Of course, the Benin people have always been politically free against the backdrop of the liberal political posture of the palace. For example, during one of President Jonathan\u2019s visits to Benin City, the Oba was reported to have introduced one of his princes who had on his own volition decamped from the ruling party in the state to the opposition. Another good example comes from the1991 governorship election in the state in which Chief John Oyegun defeated Chief Lucky Igbinedion. Although Oyegun was generally rumoured to be the Oba\u2019s favourite, the polling booth in the palace was won by his opponent- Igbinedion. What these two stories suggest is that the Oba does not influence his house-hold politically, let alone the larger community. In earnest, even if the Oba has a preferred candidate he does not as the father of all coerce anyone to affiliate with or to vote for any particular party or candidate. Rather, he prays for all aspirants who seek his blessings. Accordingly, anyone including palace chiefs in pursuit of political patronage must leave his Royal Majesty out of his self-seeking scheme In the instant case of purporting to direct the voting pattern of the Benins, the oracle-man is not persuasive. He does not even appear familiar with how those he named got into or left the federal executive council. For instance, was Stella Oduah ever appointed as Minister to represent Edo State? It is laughable that the oracle-man could not use his invincible oracle to stop the replacement of Ogiemwonyi just as he was unable to influence the appointment of a Benin Minister. History indeed records him to be a non-helper of Benin candidates hence he fought assiduously against the leading Benin candidate in the governorship election of 2012 until his preferred candidate, a non-Benin, won the election. Interestingly, the same President Jonathan he praised to high heavens then for allegedly creating an enabling environment for the election is the one he is now castigating only because of personal interest. Whereas he is free to do so for and on behalf of himself, laying claim to being the spokesman of the Benins on the subject is unfounded In heterogeneous societies like ours where competitive ethnicity is inevitable; each ethnic group requires leaders who can stand for them. The Benins in particular are in dire need of such broad-minded leaders who can take them out of their present political dilemma in which they play a second fiddle in a state where they constitute the majority. It is no doubt worrisome that neither the state governor nor the minister representing the state in the federal executive is from the ethnic group. Other substantive issues of concern to the group earlier articulated by the Edo Unity League (EUL) include \u201cthe non-redress of appropriated Edo oil wells in favour of Ondo and Delta states which greatly dwindles the oil and gas revenue potentials of Edo state\u201d. In addition, the people are painfully aware that apart from the state capital, every other Benin area passes for a mere village Thus, those in pursuit of material gains for themselves and their immediate families cannot speak for the Benins whether or not such opportunists dine with invincible forces. Accordingly, it is risky for any political party to rely on the assurances of such opportunists on how the Benins will vote in the forthcoming general elections. While PDP members and their admirers are likely to vote for President Jonathan, those dissatisfied with governance in the nation in the last 6 years would probably not. No oracle can hypnotize them to act undecidedly. Related",

It\u2019s just these papers, one cannot believe everything written on the pages of newspapers\u201d \u2018 Why do you think so? But you are reading it upside down\u201d \u201c Are you blind? The matter is also upside down. Didn\u2019t you see the headlines. INEC has released the timetable for 2015 elections\u201d \u201c Oh that!! Let me see. Presidential elections, guber elections, national assembly elections\u2026 Ha. But these are staggered elections\u201d \u201c Before nko. How were we having it ?\u201d \u201c But INEC agreed with the political parties that all the elections would hold in one day and not staggered elections\u201d \u201c Grammar. Which one is staggering elections again?\u201d Iyalode chimed in without being invited into the discussion. \u201c Who invited you into this talk. Go to the kitchen woman and prepare my lunch. Men are discussing serious matters and you put your mouth\u2026\u201d Aminu scolded his wife. \u201c But I vote. I voted for CPC in the last election\u201d \u201c My friend please help me tell my wife to go to the kitchen. She shouldn\u2019t disrupt our conversation. Which one is CPC again?\u201d \u201c Maybe she meant APC,\u201dSaka added with a mischievous smile. \u201c God forbid. Boko Haram party,\u201d Iyalode said. \u201cWhat is wrong with this woman? I asked her to go to the kitchen and she is still here talking\u201d \u201c Let\u2019s ignore her my friend. So, INEC has staggered the elections again\u201d \u201c That is what I was telling you. Look at the papers. They all reported the same thing.(Hiss)\u201d \u201c So, we are on the march again towards another election?\u201d \u201c Next year. 2015! It\u2019s just close by.\u201d \u201c Ha. PDP is finished.\u201d \u201cWhy did you say so? What about APC ?\u201d \u201c APC na medicine. You never hear of the drug called APC. It was for head-ache\u201d \u201c Na wa for you my friend. Let\u2019s get serious please.\u201d \u201c The truth is , I don\u2019t believe in any of these parties. Jona is not man enough to handle the problems in his party\u201d \u201c Is he the chairman of the party? What is Jona\u2019s business with managing the party?\u201d \u201c Haba. What are you saying? But he wants to be president again.\u201d \u201c Another third term agenda\u201d \u201c No. Second term my friend\u201d \u201c Don\u2019t join the fray of those calling it third term. It\u2019s second term\u201d \u201cBut you know I\u2019m a Buhari man\u201d \u201c Tufia. Let\u2019s get serious. We are done with military regime.\u201d \u201c What do you mean by military regime? This is democracy\u201d \u201cSo, Buhari is a politician abi? What did he forget in government house that he wants to go back and take ?\u201d \u201c The same thing that Obasanjo forgot which he has taken back. The same thing IBB wanted to go back and take at some point\u201d \u201c I prefer the PDP\u201d \u201c No way. It is a finished party\u201d \u201c I know but between the PDP and the APC is like between the devil and the deep blue sea. Head, you lose, tail, you also lose.\u201d \u201c Why do you think so?\u201d \u201cAre they not the same people. Haven\u2019t you seen APC going around begging PDP members to come and join them? So what we have today as APC is made up of the same old PDP members. So, what\u2019s the difference\u201d. \u201c I think Nigeria needs prayers\u201d \u201c Na today? We don dey pray since even before oyibo come colonise us. They are the ones responsible for the kwashiokor in this country. They have joined together strange bed-fellows and the house is on fire! Even those that joined us don\u2019t want to see us again\u201d \u201c It\u2019s true o. Nigeria at the moment is not having the best of times in the comity of nations. Our problems are too much. It will be impossible to discuss everything in one day. I believe the most serious problems can only be reduced by properly educating Nigerian students that are below the age of 18.\u201d \u201c Did you say students, which students? Those ones that have become touts and political thugs. Na for Ghana parents dey train their children now. Nigerian schools only teach students how to read and write and become thugs. Schools in Ghana teach students morals and character values, critical thinking and good citizenship.\u201d \u201c Ghana ke! Were they not our cobblers in this country?\u201d \u201c That was then. Not now. Things have changed\u201d \u201c Our younger generation are more interested in making money, not education. Many Nigerian youths see a rich man as his role model and develop a compulsive urge to make money by any means necessary, including acquiring human body parts for juju or smuggling drugs to Malaysia, Indonesia or wherever. Our Igbo brothers don\u2019t take their sons to school. They prefer them to hawk on the highways and they can hawk anything including human parts\u201d \u201c Haba, my friend. Don\u2019t talk like that. Don\u2019t let my wife hear you. You know her mother is Igbo.\u201d \u201c Our problems are more than education. Lecturers prefer to stay at home than to be in classrooms. So, don\u2019t blame those who prefer their children to hawk. Nigeria has gone bad. Nigeria ti ba je\u201d \u201c No. Here, it\u2019s eko o ni ba je. The basic problems facing Nigeria are wrong leadership and compatriots themselves; any nation which is ruled by wicked leaders can never grow. Because we have not been treated humanely by these set of leaders, all they cared for was their interests. Many things have gone wrong and most Nigerians have gone astray today. That is why, as of today, you would see many Nigerians without bearing. For instance, you would see lawyers becoming Nollywood actors and doctors becoming singers. Think of Dr Alban and Dr Sid. They are medical doctors singing jolomi all over the place. Funke Akindele and RMD are lawyers in Nollywood and Tonto Dike is a Petroleum Engineer who ended up an actress\u201d \u201c Have you finished. The latest craze is Church business. Everybody wants to become a Pastor, Alfa and Herbalist, all deceiving people in the name of money.Teenagers are being exposed to money. Youths are being exposed to rituals. Meaningless things become lucrative. Some artistes sing nonsense; become rich with the aid of evil spirit . There are churches and mosques everywhere and yet evil is increasing \u201d \u201c Religion is the opium of the masses. It\u2019s just like getting drunk and forgetting your sorrows. Religion is such a sensitive issue in Nigeria that one has to tread carefully in discussions to avoid flaring emotions, or being accused of taking sides or being misinterpreted. Religion is an important part of our lives, from birth to death, and commands immense influence in our national politics. Of course there are voices that argue against mixing politics and religion and others who share the view that politics and religion are inextricable. But religion has not stopped fraudsters in church from operating. We hear robbers even go to pastors and alfas to pray for them before going for operations.\u201d \u201c Those are the lucky ones. At least they are working, getting busy and making money with the blessing of their pastors and their guns. What about those who have no talents at all. Sorry, they have talents as armed robbers and many are graduates\u201d \u201c So, what do you expect them to be doing after graduating for years without job. A jobless man is an idle hand and that is the devil\u2019s workshop\u201d \u201c You have started again Saka. Now, you want to blame the innocent devil for nothing. Is it the devil that give them guns?\u2019 Haven\u2019t you heard that some policemen and security operatives who hold guns loan same to armed robbers for a fee and they still get share of their loot after shedding innocent blood\u201d. \u201cToo bad. There is nothing unemployment cannot cause\u201d \u201cBut you said the devil before. Now, you are blaming unemployment instead of bad leadership that brings about unemployment.\u201d \u201c I think there is a problem. Nigerians always blame the government in power for the problems of the nation even though many of these preceded the government in power. Why do we always do this? Ask any Nigerian what the problem is with Nigeria and they will say that it is leadership, forgetting that Nigeria\u2019s leaders come from amongst us; and if we are saying that our problem is leadership, we are invariably supporting the doctrine that a black man would thrive best under white rule.\u201d \u201c So if our problem is not leadership, what then is it?\u201d \u201c Unemployment\u201d. \u201c There you go again. Unemployment is the talk of the moment in Nigeria. This is rendering people frustrated. What happens to our graduates after their studies in the tertiary institutions? The situation pisses many Nigerians off. This is one of the major causes of increase in crime in Nigeria. When the graduates stay in their parents homes for a long time, the next thing is the inflow of negative thoughts. This makes them to start engaging in filthy things because their minds are occupied with bad thoughts. Do you know that till today, some who graduated about four years ago have not seen any area of their study to fit in. I must tell you that this is the torn in the flesh of the Nigerian graduates . That is where the devil comes in and that is in the form of insecurity.\u201d \u201c Ha! Nigeria we hail thee! Now this problem of insecurity is giving many citizens of this country sleepless nights. People can no longer walk comfortably on the streets. Nobody knows if bombs are planted under the ground he wants to step on. Today, Boko Haram is a well known agent of destruction in Nigeria. Many innocent families and individuals have been wiped out, many others maimed and thousands rendered homeless while schools, markets, churches, media houses have also received bitter doses of Boko Haram tragic attacks. The students in the northern part of the country pray for safety every day forgetting their study because of these hidden anti-security group\u201d \u201c You know my friend, there is this deduction from media reports that more than 935 people have been killed in about 164 suspected attacks linking Boko Haram since it launched its campaign of shooting and bomb attacks in July 2009. Report and survey put the number of deaths in the last three years of Boko Haram insurgency at over 3000\u201d \u201c Innocent lives.\u201d \u201cYes, innocent lives\u201d \u201c The ruling government is not performing its functions very well. They do not allow the youths to be fully involved in decision making. Many who are ruling in many areas do not play their roles very well. They are busy enriching their pockets due to their selfish interests.\u201d \u201c I agree with you. They have many faults : the law makers are at the same time the law offenders; the anti-corruption agents, the corruption promoters; the fraud fighters, the public fund embezzlers; preachers of peace,the agents of disunity. It is now left for you if you want to remain in poverty, if you cannot give your votes to people that can bring smile on your face. Some people would be saying if Nigeria splits, they are not concerned; which means your life is not their concern . You should not open your eyes and allow particles to sparkle into it; be wise enough. Everybody in the land must be very inquisitive in choosing their leaders, if you don\u2019t know, these are the people controlling your life directly or indirectly.\u201d \u201c Our leaders have failed us. And we don\u2019t have a good alternative. Both sides have betrayed irretrievably Nigeria\u2019s high destiny. The countless billions that Providence poured into our national coffers would have been enough to transform the lives of our poor and needy. But what have we done with it? Stolen and salted away by people in power and their accomplices; squandered in uncontrolled importation of all kinds of useless consumer merchandise from every corner of the globe; embezzled through inflated contracts to an increasing army of party loyalists who have neither the desire nor the competence to execute their contracts; consumed in the escalating salaries of a grossly overstaffed and unproductive public service.\u201d \u201c That is corruption you are talking about. It has eaten deep into our body polity, Saka. It is safe to say every problem we have in Nigeria today has its roots in corruption. We would be living in a fool\u2019s paradise for years . Rather than roll up their sleeves and concentrate on fixing Nigeria by fighting corruption frontally, our leaders have resorted to wishing the problem away by selling a warped ideology and diverting attention to insecurity. We are doomed! I wish them good luck.\u201d \u201c Where is the goodluck? Patience is what we need now because the way everything is going, if we don\u2019t have patience, things can get worse.\u201d \u201c Or should we drink APC to calm our headache?\u201d \u201c That one na expired drug. Do you still remember the company that produced APC? It is expired my friend. APC is no longer effective.\u201d \u201c Then we are finished\u201d \u201c That\u2019s a bad case then. May God help Nigeria\u201d \u201cAmen\u201d Saka and Aminu chorused. Related",

        "author": "None",
        "text": "It is generally believed that the year 2015 would mean different period to several people both in Nigeria and friendly countries. However, to the local politicians, especially the Opposition, it is the year of \u2018change\u2018. The pessimists think otherwise \u2013 the year 2015 will signify the doom of the country. Nigerian patriots (and there are many of them) think hopefully about the era of peace and prosperity in 2015 and more years. The prayer warriors have been steadfast in their appeals to God for peace and President Jonathan has not been left behind in visits to mosques and churches to ask for that golden era of prosperity under one united nation. The local parliamentarians, in their own traits, have demonstrated how easy or at times difficult (because of the federal system of government) to change the composition of the National Assembly in Abuja \u2013 the seat of the Federal Government. Even the most optimistic minds would agree that Nigeria holds greater prospects of remaining politically united and economically prosperous only if right things are done at the right time. It is reasonable to expect some spectacular changes if certain measures are taken or correct policies are formulated to challenge successfully the useful prognosis of the pessimists. Heaven, they say, would help those who help themselves. The complexity of the structure of the Nigerian nation has resurrected the ghosts of ethnicity and religious intolerance \u2013 agents of political instability. It would be to the everlasting glory of President Jonathan if the affairs of the National Conference are well managed and soundly co-ordinated that the outcome would provide Nigeria the right structure for enduring peace, prosperity and unity. This should be of more importance than the issue of second term \u2013 that euphorism for political imbecility. A great threat to the stability of the country is the Boko Haram insurgency which has engaged fully a division of the Nigerian Army and has been met faithfully by the security forces. Any time the dreaded terrorists struck and soldiers responded, human lives were involved and invariably, innocent blood is shed. There is no doubt that all Nigerians would want the Boko Haram terror gangs crushed soon, but with the good-will of all Nigerians irrespective political party affiliation. This should be translated into a general slogan by all political parties that, \u0081gCrushing of Boko Haram Insurgency is a duty that must be done. It might be foolish to be carried away by the \u2018mini-war\u2018 of the North-Eastern zone while forgetting the equally disastrous local wars constantly being waged by armed robbers (they kill innocent Nigerians by day and night and attack deposit banks as well). These nefarious activities are aided by kidnapping gangs who collect monetary rewards or kill those who could not afford. Political thugs and ritual killers abound in all political zones of the country to declare Nigeria a security risk to Nigerians and foreigners alike. Although the economy is reported stable in the last few years with inflation reduced to 8 percent (on paper), with increasing flow of direct foreign investment and stable foreign exchange operation (Central Bank often comes to the aid of the Naira against dollar pressure), many businesses are yet to trust the economy. Many analysts do question justifiably the concept of a stable economy with \u2018rising costs of doing business, with restricted access to cheap loanable funds for industrial expansion in an atmosphere of mass unemployment. The word Subsidy is not new to Nigeria\u2018s Oil Industry. It has now become romantic when it is breeding corruption, pipeline destruction and oil thefts of various dimensions. Subsidy payment on oil consumption by a well endowed oil producer looks like a stupid act of a foolish country. When local refinery capacity is inadequate, you make arrangements with other refiners for a whole range of products to satisfy your additional required products. If for example, the daily allocation of 450,000 barrels of crude oil is not adequate for the Nigerian market, why not increase the quantity allocated and utilize the refinery capacity in West Africa for a wide-range of products?, rather than report products in bit by bit. It would be a surprise if the NNPC also claims subsidy for the importation of kerosene as a single product. The answer to the mess-up in the subsidy system lies in the complete deregulation of the Downstream Sector of the Oil Industry. The angry of the oil workers against the principles of deregulation is based on misunderstanding of economic factors and lack of trust of government on the sale of government properties. The government may not sell the existing refineries to their \u2018friends\u2018, but could \u2018lease\u2018 them to oil marketers with international connection. In a deregulated downstream sector of the oil industry, the federal government would limit itself to regulatory conditions and provision of infrastructural activities. It is instructive to note that before the control of the total aspects of the oil industry, the down-stream sector worked well. As noted by me in this column, hitherto, prices of various petroleum products were agreed with government agencies by the local oil companies. On local products, each company would buy crude oil (from government), refine to its specification at the refinery (owned by government, Shell and BP, but managed by BP) and pay agreed processing fees. Each marketer was allowed a time-limit to evacuate its refined products into its own storage tanks in its depots throughout the country. In its attempt to enforce the regime of \u2018Uniform price\u2018 throughout the country, the military government had unwisely got entangled in the web of subsidy, from which it has no enough sincerity to free itself. It must be admitted that security challenges, mass unemployment, poverty, corruption and unequal distribution of income are not created by the present government under President Jonathan (through some vice have germinated fully during the present regime). If, as it appears, that the resolution of existing problems is beyond the capability of the present government and the Opposition (as it is presently constituted) seems disadvantaged, President Jonathan can wear the toga of statesmanship in his cabinet shake-up to evolve a national government to effectively tackle the problems. He seems not to be on the right path yet. Related",

        "title": "2015 Elections: The dilemma of a postponement",
        "author": "Adisa Adeleye",
        "text": "By Adisa Adeleye The last postponement by INEC Chairman of elections scheduled for 14th and 28th February 2015 is not the first one under the present Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) headed by Professor Jega. The first one under his watch happened in 2011. The postponement announced on 7th February seems to be divinely inspired and should be appreciated by all Nigerians who might have been saved the embarrassment of the century. It may be inappropriate at this moment to apportion blames, but it would be irresponsible to expect miracle from a scheme ill prepared and morally reprehensible. INEC has offered itself as the sacrificial lamb by its actions. How could it have been possible to conduct a free, fair and proper election when the Permanent Voters\u2018 Card (PVC) that INEC invented as the only means of voting, would not reach all the eligible voters before the Election Day? At the time of announcement of the postponement, about 23 million PVSs were yet to be collected by registered voters. Only Prof. Jega could explain the basis of his arrogant stance that INEC is ready to conduct a free and fair election. Many Nigerians are sure that INEC has, by the latest act of postponement, saved itself and the country from falling into the pit of shame it has dug ignorantly but vainly for Nigerians. INEC Chairman, Prof Jega The saving grace was the force of security challenge (which has always been there, but cleverly avoided or stubbornly neglected. It has become a happy conclusion that perfect reason prevailed inspite of the recognized usual tardiness of INEC planners and the immoralities and insensitivity of the political class that has been rushing INEC and its Chairman, Prof. Jega towards the pit of desperation. If I endorse fully the postponement of the February 14th and 28th elections, it is certainly not for the reasons adduced by INEC and members of the ruling party \u2013 the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) and their numerous supporters. I don\u2019t think that the Opposition, All Progressives Congress Party (APC) deserves any sympathy for willingly submitting to any political contest in a highly unstable political and economic environment. Perhaps those poor Nigerians who charge politicians of being selfish and unpatriotic have their points. How would a serious country that is engaged in a bloody civil warfare against murderous and unyielding insurgents, whose, national currency is undermined by economic saboteurs everyday and the lives of its innocent citizens subjected to incessant attacks by armed robbers and bandits, be involved in the wasteful merriments that go for political rallies? It looks as immoral that when other countries are putting their forces on our soil to overcome the enemy which appears invincible, the political leaders are seen in their multi-coloured dresses politicking all over the country. Why should the gladiators not cease fire and concentrate on hammering the Boko Haram insurgents and work conscientiously towards saving the Naira, seems a pertinent question. However, it looks as if the country and its political leadership are struck by some demonic strange disease that prevents the apprehension of the importance of the serious danger knocking at the gate. It should be recalled that when Britain, our past colonial masters had similar political and economic problems in the 1930s, it resorted to a Unity Government to save the Pound. The Nigerian economic, political and security crisis appear too complicated to be left entirely to the present Government to tackle alone. If the elections have been postponed for six weeks because of security dangers and tardiness of INEC, what are the assurances of March and April dates? Some Nigerians may appear as incurable optimists but certainly, many are not blind to the existing glaring facts. Many party supporters might have been convinced through propaganda that President Jonathan is the best PDP President so far. Many supporters of Buhari do certainly believe that he possess the magical wand to fix all Nigeria\u2018s problems. Political system However, former elected Presidents like Shagari and Obasanjo and Heads of State like Gowon, Buhari, Babangida and Abubakar would attest to the complexity of Nigerian problems and the obstacles to national unity, political and economic stability. President Jonathan is a living example of how best your effort is, it may still not be good enough in certain circle. Therefore, it would not require one form of stargazing to conclude that no single party would be able to master the intricacies that surround governance of the country and the complexity of the Nigerian political system. The glaring problem is that politicians come and go, but like the French Borbons, they learnt nothing and forgot nothing. They are schooled in the philosophy of \u201cwinners take all\u201d and they believe fervently in the culture of \u201cwhat we have, we hold\u201d, at all cost. These nebulous concepts, are however alien to a plural society like Nigeria. This nation has never been so divided into tribal religious and ethnic classes in its politics and between the very rich and the most desperate poor in its economic setting. The necessary middle class did not thrive during the boom period of oil wealth leaving room for its decline during the coming period of austerity after the elections. The Nigerians, under the devaluation of the naira, would continue to do with only imported second-hand commodities. The policy of devaluation works in a flourishing manufacturing environment where cheaper domestic prices would stimulate external demand. Viewing the present position from the background of the past heightened political tempo, the contending political parties have shown remarkable maturity. This is a good sign for the future if relative peace is maintained during and after the elections in March and April. I believe that in order to save the country from further economic, political and social decadence, widespread rural poverty and urban congestion, with its attendant filth and disease, it is necessary to seek a new solution in the idea of a genuine NATIONAL GOVERNMENT of wider and tested talents. Surely, the prayer of the country is that the Boko Haram insurgency should be over before the next government is sworn in: And the good people of Nigeria shall say, Amen. Related",

        "text": "By Adisa Adfeleye The good news of the week was the clearing of the murderous gangs from some parts of the country which they have forcefully occupied and wantonly devastated. The country\u2018s gallant security outfits should be handsomely rewarded for the victories, and the support of all Nigerians is needed for the eventual victory over the Boko Haram insurgents also. The supporting forces of Niger and Chad should be appreciated for coming to the aid of their neighbour at the crucial moment. In the midst of such glorious celebration, it is heartening to hear the army forces saying and quite aloud, that never will Nigeria again be subjected to the ignominy of internal insurgency and its army to the ridicule by rebellious armed gangs. While the armed forces are stretching themselves to clear the insurgents from the remaining three local government areas, the country\u2019s politicians continue to argue on the suitability of INEC\u2018s invention \u2013 the smart Card Reader for the elections of March 28 and April 11, 2015. The ruling party and its supporters are saying quite clearly that, a new device (not thoroughly tested) is not suitable for an important election, like the coming presidential contest. Meanwhile the electoral umpire INEC has been maintaining its confident stance, that \u2018We are ready\u2018. Yet, not many Nigerians are convinced beyond reasonable doubt, that INEC is ready. In the ridiculous battle over the readiness of INEC, it appears as if the ruling party is unsure about its approach to the elections and jittery about electoral results which may not be favourable. Some analysts think PDP party should not be nervous because of the party\u2018s political dominance in many areas of the country. The Opposition being the underdog has suddenly become the more confident contender taking the necessary challenge to the ruling party. The APC is seen by many Nigerians as the defender of the umpire who was unilaterally selected by the ruling party whose leader is a contestant. In the midst of the confusion over the distribution of PVCs and the Card Reader, the INEC Chairman, Prof Jega is the Grandmaster and the Opposition, the Teaser \u2013 It is a new political tactic to confront the ruling party. The other day while waiting to collect my PVC (which I have not got), a young lady was bold to say that the political problems and instability of the system has been the lack of maturity among the Ibo and Yoruba leaders, past and present. I have since pondered over the seemingly innocent opinion of the young Nigerian lady. This view would coincide with the reporter\u2018s observation of late Chief Emeka Ojukwu that the solution to the political hegemony of the Hausa/Fulani would only be challenged by the cooperation of political leaders of South-west and South-east zones of the country, i.e AD in the West and APGA in the East. However, this might not happen. Looking back into history, Nigeria opted for the British Parliamentary system at Independence in 1960 with the prospect of a government and the opposition or a coalition government of all parties (Unity government). From the results of elections held in 1959, the formation of a national government would have been preferable. The NPC won 134 seats \u2013 all from the North; the NCNC came second with 89 seats (58 from East; 8 from North and 23 from West) and the AG was placed 3rd with 73 seats (25 from North; 34 from West and 14 from East) minority areas. These figures show that the NPC party had no overall majority and that NCNC (89) and AG (73) could have formed a working majority with 162 seats, even with 16 other candidates joining NPC, NCNC or AG. However, the predictable but negotiated alliance was between NPC of the North and the NCNC of the East. Tafawa Balewa of the NPC became the Prime Minister and Dr. Azikiwe took the position of a ceremonial President while Awolowo chose to become the Leader of Opposition. Thus, the first chance of Ibo and Yoruba political leaders working together was lost. Chief Awolowo was jailed in 1962 for felony and treason. The North/East coalition experiment failed with the military coup of 1966 and the consequent Biafra war of 1967 to 1970. After the return of civilian rule in 1979, other electoral opportunities were open for the reconciliation of all the political forces of the country through the breaking of the 3 powerful regions (with Mid-west, carved out of Western Region) into 19 States which recognized the rights of the minorities. The 1979 elections contested by three major old parties (but under different names\u2013NPN (former NPC with broader base); NPP (old NCNC); and UPN (transformed from Yoruba led AG). The leading presidential candidates were Shagari (NPN \u2013 Sir Ahmadu Bello had been killed in 1966 military coup); Dr. Azikiwe for NPP and Chief Awolowo for the UPN. Nigeria had adopted the USA type of federalism since 1979 and the posture of the candidates showed the return of the old political rivalry \u2013 Hausa/Fulani \u2013 Ibo \u2013 Yoruba. Looking back into the political history of the country, it could be discovered that lack of mutual trust and understanding among the Yoruba and Ibo leaders had affected their political fortunes. In the era before 1960, the Eastern Region (Ibo majority) and Western Region (mainly Yoruba) had been fierce political fields by the NCNC (led by Dr. Nnamdi Azikiwe) and Action Group led by Chief Obafemi Awolowo. The North (under Sir Ahmadu Bello) remained in a \u2018splendid isolation\u2018 with the exception of Action Group incursions in the Middle Belt. The Action Group and its leader suffered grievously for that impudence. However, the 1959 election results show dominance of the NPC in the North and the presence of NCNC and AG in all the three Regions. The NPN victory of Shagari in the presidential election of 1979 seemed to put an end to the effect of tribal politics and ethnic block-voting as Ibo and Yoruba solid votes could help neither Dr. Azikiwe nor Chief Awolowo to win. Another feature of 1979 elections was the deep gulf in Yoruba and Ibo politics. Shagari scored more votes in Iboland than Awolowo and also scored more votes in Yorubaland than Dr. Azikiwe. The Hausa/Fulani became the grandmaster of the political chess game of the time. During the political experiment of former military junta, Moshood Abiola, a Yoruba Muslim tried to pull off a political trick by fielding a Northern Muslim under the SDP party. The June 12, 1993 presidential election which was cruelly annulled by military President Babangida was presumed to have been won by Abiola. However, Abiola lost to Tofa in Ibo areas with 739,748 votes to 790,371 votes (Tofa had an Ibo as his running mate). The old impression was that Northern politicians were preferable to the Yoruba counterparts in Ibo areas before and after the civil war. It looks as if the Ibo voters since 1999 have been sticking to the party and not the tribe. Under the PDP, they helped Obasanjo to overcome his Yoruba challenger, Falae. In cooperation with the Yoruba in 2003, Obasanjo was aided to overcome his challenger, Buhari. The total support was given to Yar\u2018Adua in 2007 and to Jonathan in 2011 against Buhari. At present, the Hausa/Fulani block-voting is real; the Ibo block-voting is real; the Yoruba block-voting has long disappeared (thanks to Obasanjo). Related",

        "author": "Tonnie Iredia",
        "text": "By Tonnie Iredia On Saturday June 29, 2013, an election was held in Oguta constituency of Imo State. The umpire, the Independent National Electoral Commission, INEC, says it could not declare a winner because the contest was inconclusive. This time around, those who are usually fast at commending the Jega led INEC have been a bit cautious. The truth however is that INEC has never performed above average. As one newspaper aptly opined the other day, those who praise our elections are \u201cthose who lower standards to accommodate mediocrity\u201d. It was thus a relief to hear that President Goodluck Jonathan has himself showed disgust over the outcome of the Oguta election \u2013 an event which in reality was not in any way different from our other elections. Against this backdrop, we agree with the President that those who made the rerun election in Oguta to be inconclusive must be brought to book. History tells us that we have never been able to bring our political thugs and their sponsors to book. Therefore, is it not time to go beyond the usual focus on the ignoble roles of our politicians during elections? While not condoning such unwholesome posture, the rationale for the conduct of our political class which is to win an election at all cost is easy to identify. But how do we place the other actors in the game who are supposed to be neutral? Do they too have an election to win? Relevant here are (a) Security operatives, (b) the Judiciary and (c) the electoral body. Ensuring that malpractices do not mar an election is no doubt rational. It is ostensibly for this reason that an election venue in Nigeria often takes the pattern of a battle field with far too many armed personnel hovering around. Unfortunately, the so called security operatives often become the problem as many voters for fear of being molested or indeed of becoming victims of \u2018stray bullets\u2019 keep away from the sacred civic duty of voting. In Oguta, security operatives armed to the teeth were everywhere. They reportedly rounded off a batch of thugs numbering about 20 at Agwa community, disarmed and arrested them, yet; there was still ample snatching of ballot boxes. Considering the numerous stories of how security personnel act scripts of the highest bidders by intimidating likely opponents, what would be the fate of the 2015 elections? As for the Judiciary, the handling of election controversies has become the weakest point in its constitutional mandate which is the settlement of disputes. There are by far too many examples of how politicians often used the judiciary to win elections in Nigeria. For the 2015 elections, will our judges refrain from the trend of using technicalities to supplant substantive justice? In earnest, it is often quite difficult to comprehend the type of joy and peace which society can enjoy from certain judicial pronouncements. For example, the Ondo State election tribunal had declined jurisdiction to look into the petitioner\u2019s complaint that several unlawful names were injected into the voters\u2019 register which was used to conduct the election. To the tribunal, the \u2018frivolous\u2019 complaint was only a pre-election matter. How does a candidate get to know that fake names had been surreptitiously injected into the voter\u2019s register until their votes have been counted when in Nigeria even INEC does not know the authentic voters\u2019 list? Put differently, do the defects in a voters\u2019 register become good because attention was drawn to them after the casting of ballots? Luckily, the Court of Appeal overruled the tribunal. It would not have been strange if it did not. After all, the same Court of Appeal which also ruled that it was a breach of the electoral law for INEC to have failed to display the voters\u2019 register for the public to scrutinize properly before the election could not be persuaded that the issues were strong enough to have adversely affected the conduct of the election. Why should INEC not follow the law? Meanwhile, the most fundamental element of an election is the voters\u2019 register because the number of polling stations, ballot boxes, ballot papers and other materials are usually determined by the numerical strength of the register. When it is over listed, the extra ballot papers arising from the supposed figure in the register can be used to rig elections through multiple voting. When the register is under-listed, those excluded can cause chaos and general disruption of the voting day process. Thus, if our subsisting inaccurate voters\u2019 register and INEC\u2019s temporary voters\u2019 cards would be in use in 2015, should we expect success? The injection of fake names into the Ondo voters\u2019 register could only have been done by INEC \u2013 our electoral umpire that is permanently overwhelmed by any type of election. Did the returning officer actually endorse the Oguta election result as alleged? No one knows. Whereas the Imo State Resident Electoral Commissioner, Professor Celina Okoh, eloquently described how the election was violently disrupted in certain polling centres which made INEC to declare the event as inconclusive, she made no mention of how election materials were as usual late to the centres. When it is a general election, people tend to sympathize with INEC for having to withstand some daunting logistics of elections associated with Nigeria\u2019s difficult geographical terrains. When it is an election in only one State, the story is the same. In Oguta \u2013 just one local government area, the election was in only 4 out of 11 wards for only one seat in the Imo State House of Assembly, yet media reports revealed that many voters became restive after waiting in vain for several hours for the election process to commence. When will INEC conduct an election where materials do not arrive late to an election centre? Even smaller issues call for concern. As of today, the commission as a referee uses only the green card. It does not appear to have a red card. The last time it summoned courage to wave a yellow card at the ruling party about defects in its National Convention, it did so one year after the event! What a referee for the all important 2015 elections!! Related",

        "author": "Adisa Adeleye",
        "text": "By Adisa Adeleye THAT the presidential election did not hold on February 14, 2015 (last Saturday) is a new hard fact. The reliable umpire (INEC) has rescheduled the election to March 28, 2015 to allow for a fair election in a peaceful atmosphere. Although reactions in various quarters have been mixed as expected, the reality is here with us to prepare well that the date is characterized by free, fair and credible voting. It is a fact that the behaviours of the party supporters have been less edifying and dangerous, and that it calls for strong warning and action by party leaderships. In the preparation for elections, it seems as if many party supporters are yet to escape from the jungle of the past era. As noted by an election official, Alhaji Amadu Kurfi, \u2018the campaigns for the election were characterized in all regions with thuggery, violence, arrests and imprisonments of political opponents by agencies of Regional governments and denial of permits to hold public meetings or procession. Other negative acts are placement of obstacles against free assembly, expression of free speech and conduct of violence \u2013 free election campaigning and canvassing for votes. These difficulties were so pervasive and the political atmosphere so charged that all the leaders of the political parties met in Lagos in October 1964 and signed a \u2018Peace Agreement\u2018. The political atmosphere in the 1950s and early 1960s could hardly be differentiated from the present situation where the presidential campaign train is constantly being stoned in some parts of the North and in the Rivers State where the opposition is often denied space to campaign freely \u2013 the stoning in Katsina (North) and the shooting in Okirika (Rivers) are the barbaric reminders of the ugly late 1950s and early 1960s. The unfortunate display of lack of political tolerance and mutual understanding was one of the causes of the undesirable civil war of 1967 to 1970. INEC official displays an empty ballot box Many observers of the Nigerian complex political scenery since 1960 would point vividly to the stubborn but false attitude towards unity as a basic problem of the country. This is seen in the notion (false or true) that the North would always want to rule Nigeria at all costs. The interpretation of the present contest between President Jonathan and his challenger, Buhari a retired army major-general, as a battle between the old feudal North and progressive South, are missing the real point. If Buhari represents the Conservative Hausa/Fulani \u201cborn to rule\u201d caste, what is Adamu Muazu (Hausa/Fulani) doing in the ruling PDP as its Chairman? Certainly, he is not from Arondiziogu (Imo) or Otu-Oke in Bayelsa. The problem with Nigeria`s politics has to do with one important factor \u2013 exercise of power in its safe haven. The control of the Federal Government and all its resources, including Oil is the main factor. Since the discovery of oil and the importance of its revenue, politics has become very lucrative and political unity, elusive. Since the country\u2018s political freedom in 1960, the control of the \u2018Central Government\u2018 has been the battle-cry of all political parties, including, of course, the military politicians of the 1960s, 70s, 80s of the 20th century. At present, the prospects of controlling the federal government is more alluring \u2013 having more than 52 per cent of the federal resources, including oil, appointing all sorts of positions and in charge (through its agency) of monthly allocations to all states and local government. In spite of Nigeria being regarded as a Federal State, it is run as a unitary one, owing to the long illegal usurpation of power by the \u2018military politicians\u2018. It has been observed and justifiably so, that Nigeria\u2018s main problem lies in lack of political unity. The lack of unity has been responsible for the inability for a strong leadership to emerge, especially at the federal level. Religious and ethnic sentiments have confined the lovely and fine exploits of past leaders like Sir Ahmadu Bello, Dr. Azikiwe and Chief Obafemi Awolowo to their immediate serfdoms. The Federal Prime Minister, Abubakar Tafawa Balewa\u2018s exploits ended in matyrdom of a coupist bullets. The intervening army rules which were essentially forced \u2018national government could not withstand the test of time. Often, coups and counter coups among their ruling classes prevented the rise of a strong national figure. The strong man Abacha distinguished himself as an illegal investor of public funds in banks in foreign countries. It is the view of many Nigerians that the complexity of the country\u2018s problems built on a deficient structure and aided by incompetence and corruption could not allow for the rise of a popular leader or the dominance of a strong party over a long period. It is a fact that the current problems of the country are not created by the present government and that it has tried according to its best to improve the situation. However, the present situation of the country is general insecurity, leading to warfare in the North-Eastern part of the country, bloody armed robbery of banks and homes, political thuggery, violence, ritual killings and kidnappings (less reported) nowadays. In a prevailing confused state of the nation, it will be unnecessary for the Attorney General and Minister of Justice to remind people that \u2018Interim\u2018 or Unity Government is not in the 1999 Constitution. It is generally agreed that \u201cInterim Government\u201d is an aberration and unknown to our Constitution. Fighting of insurgents Also, one could look in vain into the Constitution the existence of \u2018Boko Haram Sect\u2018 or the existence of foreign troops on our soil to fight our insurgents. Certainly, the presence of military personnel at polling stations may not be found in the 1999 Constitution. The Constitution, as they say, is made for the people of a surviving country, and actions are taken to face the challenges of the moment. Many patriotic Nigerians feel that the re-scheduled elections would be properly conducted by INEC and that the country\u2018s gallant security forces will crush the murderous insurgents and the country would return to the path of peace and prosperity. However, it is instructive to note that whichever party wins would face the prospect of a sick economy threatened by depression (through reduced revenue from oil) and a politically divided and ruptured society. Perhaps those clamouring fervently for a form of genuine unity government have their strong points. It is not only being aware of Ides of March, but also the prognosis of 2015. Related",

        "author": "Adisa Adeleye",
        "text": "By Adisa Adeleye It looks as if the principal gladiators in the March 28, 2015 Presidential election are using the opportunities provided by the postponement of February 14, 2015 to re-emphasise their earlier promises of making the country more secure and prosperous. There is no doubt that all Nigerians are very happy with the exploits of our patriotic and fearless security outfits (aided by their neighbours) in overcoming the armed and murderous insurgents. It has been pleasant news that the brutally displaced persons are now returning to their homes. However, it appears that euphoria of the military successes against the Boko Haram sect in some parts of the North East seems to have redirected emphasis from some vital issues. As the political campaigns are gradually winding up, the media have done great job in bringing out some prominent supporters of the contending parties to speak on various topics. Many supporters see the election as a personal (or beauty) contest between President Jonathan and his challenger, General Buhari (rtd). Buhari, Jega and Jonatrhan It is absolutely necessary to bring back the agitated minds of the gladiators to some vital National issues before the close of the long but dull debate. These are issues on Security, Power, Employment and Political/Economic stability. It is true that no nation could survive long if its subjects are subjected to constant attack by insurgents and the \u2018life and property\u2018 is not safe. The worse scenario is offered by the Hobbesian \u2018State of Nature\u2018 where everything is in total chaos (without any trace of civilization) and where \u2018life is nasty, brutish and short\u2018. This looks like a philosophical fantasy until Boko Haram descended on some parts of the country with guns and bombs. And in the cool evening at Chibok, they carted away more than 200 School girls, unchallenged. The Sambisa Forest, it was reported, had been cleared by our gallant forces, but where are the abducted girls? Perhaps, their release would be a pleasant pre-election surprise, May it be so. The pertinent question being asked by patriotic Nigerians is what happens when Boko Haram insurgency has been suppressed and the foreign troops are back in their neighbouring countries? There are other national problems of incessant daylight bank robberies, political thuggery and intolerance of opposition (Okirika incidence of shooting and bombing); kidnapping of people (including medical personnel) and ritual killings. It is generally agreed that an insecure environment could not promote stability and prosperity. Another vital national issue is the problem of electricity supply which has become a bogey of the present federal government. In fairness, the federal government under the PDP has laboured vigorously though in vain, to butcher the beast of darkness in the country in the past 15 years; it is understood that more than $32 billion had been invested to brighten the dark alleys and provide the engine of economic growth and healthy living. The latest attempt on privatization has thrown the country back into dark ages. Perhaps, as some patriots argue, if willing State governments have been brought into the exercise, it would have been better. There is no doubt that Lagos, Oyo and Ogun State governments would have shown interest in EGBIN Power Station which requires enormous capital quite beyond what private investors (looking for quick profits) could afford in the short term. But addiction to crude oil production seems to have blocked the vision of the country\u2018s economic planners to exploit successfully other means. It is generally believed that widespread unemployment has been responsible or has direct link with the rise of crime in this country. Both the government and the opposition have been promising extensive investment in job creating ventures without convincing facts. Unfortunately, unemployment is a serious matter which could not be wished away by moral suasion. The Western economically advanced nations, since Keynes, have adopted the policy of mass injection of public funds into the dormant economy to stimulate effective demand and thereby, increase employment opportunities. A typical case is that of President Roosevelt of the United States (USA) who in the 1930s used the tool of Budget Deficit (spending more than income) to tackle the problems of depression and unemployment, by directing massive investments into the clearing of drains, building of new ports, new houses and roads. Unfortunately, Nigeria\u2019s budget deficits over the years had gone into sustaining bloated recurrent expenditure with small allocation for infrastructural development (capital expenditure). The 2015 Budget is another typical example of low emphasis on capital expenditure. In a situation of high rate of unemployment as the case in Nigeria, such problem according to a noted British economist; Professor R. G. Lipsey is best tackled by encouraging governments, firms and households to be spend thrift as much as possible because, other things being equal, the more prodigal and spend thrift the households, the higher will be the level of national income and employment. So it is possible to vary the volume of aggregate expenditure and thus, stimulate effective demand for goods and services. However, in Nigeria, other things are far from being equal. The federal government over the years, would not inject massive funds into the economy for fear of inflation. The conservative Central Bank \u2013 the monetary authority has always been in the habit of mopping up any sign of excess liquidity in the economy. Often, what looks like the liberal fiscal policy of incentives for industrial expansion is contradicted by harsh monetary stance to create misery in the midst of plenty. Many Nigerians see the challenging problems of the country after the elections. There is that reduction in income from oil exports, reduction in monthly allocations to all tiers of governments (with high recurrent expenditures). The Nigerian Senate has wisely suggested the reduction of the 2015 Budget by 25 per cent in the face of oil price cut by more than 50 per cent. There is no doubt that any party that wins the election would face the post election social and economic problems of adding the figures and balancing the unpredictable and uneven equations. From empirical evidence, the social, political and economic problems of a plural society are too weighty for a single party with its jaded mentality of \u201cwinners-take-all\u201d to carry. Perhaps the gallant gladiators will assure all Nigerians that, the next government will be the government of best Nigerians for Nigeria \u2013 no winner no loser. Related",

        "author": "Ugoji Egbujo",
        "text": "By Ugoji Egbujo In 2003 we had elections and I happened to be in Orodo, my home town. I opted to observe rather than vote. The polling booth beside my house was quiet and all seemed to be going well until two young men \u2018swooped\u2019 on the officials with cutlasses and snatched the ballot box. While the box was \u201csabbatical\u201d those who strolled in to go through the voting process could only manage mournful smiles. Their consternation was measured, weak. Where did that sense of familiarity with such an atrocity come from? Many only worried about their wasted time. And those who managed to mutter outrage were subdued by the aloofness of the official . The box returned after about half an hour. Impunity. The officials continued their duties solemnly as if the interlude was scripted. Perhaps they were ashamed of their collusion. Those who knew said the ballot box came back half filled. PDP was the only party with any kind of presence then in Imo besides APGA which was not really interested in presidential elections. A local PDP man had promised to deliver the area and he did. Political parties surreptitiously submit names to INEC for employment as adhoc electoral staff. So It was not difficult to understand that somnambulism manifested by the presiding officer. In 2011 Imo presented a statistical challenge. The governorship election was hotly contested . Three political heavy weights including the then incumbent governor Ohakim were literally tearing at themselves. Armed with the overreach of local incumbency and the omnipotence of federal might, Ohakim should have victory within grasps. His misfortune was that he was widely perceived as incompetent and he had a popular rival in Rochas Okorocha to contend with. He was also not helped by a recalcitrant kinsman, Ararume, who would split the votes of his home constituency, Okigwe with him. Campaigns were at full throttle and inner recesses of the state were all plumbed for votes. Rochas won that election , scoring just about 336,000 votes , beating incumbent Gov Ohkim with 40,000 votes after supplementary elections . It was a close fight till the end. Total votes cast in that governorship election in Imo in 2011 was about 750,000, representing a 44 % voter turn out. In the same 2011, in the same Imo state, in the same month of April, before the governorship election , the presidential elections held . The two main parties in Imo, APGA and PDP supported Jonathan. ACN was not interested. Jonathan is not from Imo state , is not an Igbo man and is not their in-law. Against a northern muslim , the average Igbo man , \u2018allergic \u2018 to Hausa Fulani hegemony and fearful of its return would cling to Jonathan. Igbos do not necessarily love Jonathan, they fear domination and they believe that the triumph of a minority man helps to disrupt or suspend any group\u2019s feelings of political superiority and may help create a level playing field. So they voted Jonathan but not with passion. Total number of votes cast in the presidential was a miraculous 1, 400,000 with a voter turn out of 83% which was the highest percentage voter turn out in the south east and the second highest in the nation just behind Jonathan\u2019s home sate of Bayelsa. There was palpable voter apathy but reality does not matter. Figures do. And the figures showed a near total turn out for Jonathan. It was magical. Perhaps for a better perspective, Imo\u2019s voter turn out was 83 % in the presidential and 44% in the governorship election. Half of those who voted in the presidential didn\u2019t care to vote in the more fiercely contested governorship election? Strange. The average national voter turn out was about 50% for the presidential elections , the average voter turn out in the south west was 32% and the average for Jonathan\u2019s home region of south south was 67%. Imo was indeed special. Yet Imo was, in a sense, in the manner politicking is done in Nigeria, a\u2019 third party\u2019 in that presidential contest. How did they achieve such a turn out? Bayelsa\u2019s 85 % can be understood, riverine areas have a way of doing these things. And with their son, an incumbent president on the ballot, it could have been higher. Ogun was 28%, Edo 37% but Imo was 83%. The real policing on the field during elections is provided by the enthusiasm and watchfulness of the electorate and the vigilantism furnished by political rivalry amongst the parties. When these factors went missing in Imo during the presidential election in 2011 all manner of things happened. So you can get to the booth as it happened in my local constituency in 2011 and the INEC officials sit idly. And you ask about the ballot box and you are told some youths have taken it away. A few minutes of discreet inquiry and you are told the group involved and where they were \u2018working\u2019. The stuffing of the ballot box could be going on in a private residence of a political jobber a stone throw from the polling booth. It happened during the 2011 presidential election and went unchallenged but was resisted during the fiercely contested governorship election . A military/police patrol team was called in and the perpetrators were arrested, pants down, thumbs in ink, thumb-printing and stuffing the ballot box on the election day. That episode managed to find its way into the press. Real voters had gone to the polling booth and found only yawning officials who didn\u2019t know where the ballot box they came with was. Those who committed that crime suffered no real consequences, were granted bail the next day and have been free ever since. Fortunately, opprobrious tales of the incident have become part of the village\u2019s market folklore . So the Imo magic can be explained, its an abracadabra the locals understand and INEC must know something about. The combination of the permanent voters card and the card reader if employed without hitches would , to a great extent, minimize such electoral frauds. The chip on the card has the voter\u2019s biometric details and the card reader would authenticate the card and identify the voter before he is accredited. The card reader has a sim and so stores information of PVCs processed and so provides an audit trail. It also relays information about the accreditation process to a central server too so INEC will know how many genuine voters accredited in a particular polling unit. So my friends in the village are perhaps out of work in this election. The Card reader effectively puts them out of work. Perhaps they will have other assignments. Now with the card reader It wouldn\u2019t matter that other parties even have no agents. The card readers are programmed to read the cards of voters of a particular polling unit. No body can leverage on voter apathy and turn out bogus numbers. Even if the whole village conspires with electoral officers and party agents, the card reader will have details of those properly accredited and can be relied upon by INEC to disregard bogus figures from a polling unit while collating. This will reduce the volume of litigation as INEC can cancel results based on discrepancies with card reader data. So why is the PDP hesitant about the use of card readers? You would think that the party that has labeled the opposition party leader as out dated, \u201canalogue\u201d, would readily welcome INECs card readers in furtherance of its cherished \u2018digital\u2019 reputation. But they prefer the \u201c stone age\u201d 2011 scenario. The PDP says they are worried because the card readers have not been tested. That the card readers should have been tested in a smaller election where failure will have lighter implications. That argument has merits . But since this election is the first fiercely contested presidential elections in Nigeria and one where the margin of victory may be very slim the advantage of employing the card readers to stem electoral fraud may out weigh any risks of tardiness flowing from the introduction of a novelty at a crucial moment. It is true that widespread hitches can precipitate a crisis but this process has been used successfully in many African countries. What the PDP has not openly said , but which its officials have muted in so many ways, is that they are worried about the integrity of INEC. But are they worried that INEC may disadvantage them or are they worried that INEC might bungle the process and throw the country into confusion? I suspect they are worried about both. A pattern has become clear, the opposition solidly supports INEC and supports use of card readers while PDP has been cautious, hesitant and often un- approving of INEC. The PDP has right of protest but cannot engage in tarnishing the image of INEC .The PDP has advertorials disparaging Jega and INEC and that is ridiculous. INEC must not just be seen to be independent but their independence must be respected by all parties. INEC has confidence in the card readers and has procured 152,000 of them and they have adequate redundancies- additional 26,000 units as spares and 35,000 spare batteries. And all of these will translate to a spare battery for every 5 polling units and a spare card reader for every 7 polling units. This is a reasonable back up plan. The INEC staff have been trained and are being retrained. Whether it is in Abia or in an IDP camp in Borno, potential heavens for ballot box stuffing, the card reader will stem hitherto inevitable fraud . Our polity is extremely polarized and tense, the margins will be slim, every vote is significant. Close elections are often won by one or two percentage points and we must prevent the sort of thing that happened in Imo in 2011. It may not have mattered so much then but it may have grave implications now. Related",

        "text": "By Adisa Adeleye As Nigerian politicians are busy preparing for the 2015 elections, perhaps the murderous gangs of insurgents are also busy perfecting the logistics of throwing their deadly weapons on their selected spots at the time of their choice. There is that simple theory that notorious insurgents have infiltrated everywhere. It seems as if our politicians are using the unusual lull in bomb attacks to practice their own trade of invidious politicking; especially when the Osun gubernatorial election is at hand. On Boko Haram insurgency, a political spokesman said on television that \u201cAPC is the political wing of Boko Haram\u201d. Another politician retorted saying, `sooner those behind and sponsoring Boko Haram insurgency would be revealed` The inference is that the PDP as a party knows more about the activities of the insurgents than could be imagined. Afterall, the argument goes on and on, Borno State is ruled by the opposition party, as well as two other states under Emergency Rule . Another ugly dimension has unfortunately been added to the puerile argument \u2013 that the people of Borno (though Muslim) were not conquered by the Fulani jihadists during the religious cleansing of Uthman Danfodio in the 18thcentury. It could mean that the modern jihadists in the hierarchy of the PDP would want to settle the political and religious issues this time. The descendants of the 18thcentury jihadists belong to the Fulani race and are Muslims while Borno people are not and have substantial non-Muslim minority. Personally, I don\u2018t subscribe to what looks like a dangerous religious and political theory which represents warped thinking. The prolonged insurgence and the inability of the security operators to bring it to speedy end is perhaps responsible for the emergence of spurious thoughts It is now clear, more than ever before, that the Boko Haram insurgency is a serious affair beyond the realm of party politics. This is a civil war which is daily threatening the stability and unity of the country and might damage its present and future economic prospects, if not effectively resolved. The buck-passing attitude of some political leaders (jesters) is not appropriate for such a serious matter. The expectation is that all hands must be on deck to save the nation from the devastating war that shows no respect for religion or ethnicity. The Boko Haram insurgency could be traced to other vices of armed robbery, kidnappings and political and ritual murders that have ravaged the country for some time. The inadequate security forces\u2018 responses tend to encourage the enemies of the state to continue to rejoice and cause more havoc. Many patriots have suggested loudly that the counter measure to crippling security challenges lie only in a united action by all Nigerians and not a policy of scoring political points. There should be a joint attempt by the government and the opposition to wardoff the menace of insurgency and the devastation of other serious crimes now, and not in 2015 \u2013 the year predicted for the country\u2018s dissolution. Another serious but unresolved problem is the electoral process. Many Nigerians believe, and rightly so, that impediments to a free and fair election should have been removed by now. However, it seems that a Court\u2018s judgment has become the more reliable result than the ballot box. The acts of ballot box stuffing and snatching have been challenged by heavy presence of security personnel at the polling booths. However, there are serious challenges posed by INEC corrupt officials at the central collation centres, inserting of wrong figures and announcing of fake results or lateness or non supply of electoral materials. It is also suggested that the present technique of first voter accreditation and voting later, by itself, could contribute to voters\u2018 apathy or create room for mischief. It would have been easier for the voter to cast its vote immediately after he is accredited without going home and come again. Such method has greatly affected the number of voters who actually voted against the number of voters accredited. I have taken part in many voting exercises in Britain and Nigeria without any fear of \u2018accidental discharge\u2018. So far, the security officials have been reported to be behaving well in spite of their intimidating presence. The argument rests on the perception of the people of the country that, INEC must be seen to be impartial in conducting what is regarded as a free and fair election. The act of setting up an Election Tribunal after elections and the heavy deployment of security forces during election period say much about INEC integrity. If an election is seen by majority of patriotic Nigerians as free and fair, the less would be the patronage of Tribunals and appeals to the busy Supreme Court. On the economy, it is assumed by many that mass unemployment has direct links to abject poverty and the sudden growth of crimes and insurgency, which often lead to both political and economic instability. Another similar problem is that of unequal and inequitable distribution of income or resources, especially in a plural society. Since the depressions of the 1930s, the Western European nations have tamed unemployment by fiscal means of Budget Deficit to stimulate a dormant economy to expansion. Also, by judicious means of taxation, discrepancy in income distribution has been greatly reduced. In Britain, abundance of social security provisions has minimized greatly the effects of poverty and deaths through hunger. Unfortunately, Nigeria is yet to evolve a spirit of political unity and attitude of mind to tackle most of the problems of Insecurity, Abject poverty and Instability. It has been proved by current events that the formidable problems of the country are more than the capability of a single party in spite of the alluring prospects of the Transformation Agenda.

        "text": "By Adisa Adeleye Political party adherents and commentators on public affairs are always interested in the final results of elections, especially the keenly contested ones. It becomes more interesting when it is a straight political duel between the ruling party which is accustomed to a period of easy victories and a resurgent opposition which is solidly bent on changing the political scenery. According to many analysts, there is actually no marked distinction between the leading parties on economic philosophy \u2013 their leaders are simply capitalist birds with their beaks dyed in lurid colours \u2013 the Babangida version of, a \u201cLittle to the right\u201d and a `Little to the left`. Both PDP and APC promise massive employment programmes without a slight indication of where the desired capital investment would come from. Empirical evidence has shown absolute reliance on `oil money` which is now dwindling fast owing to the fall in prices of different grades of crude oil. The immediate switch from costly imports to cheaper home-made goods is a false economic doctrine especially in a place where manufacturing opportunities are hampered by decaying infrastructures and frustrated by high cost of funds for expansion. Some wise manufacturers have started to meet the challenges by not raising the prices of their products but by reducing the contents of their packages. The concentration of the public on the economic policies (or lack) of the main political parties has prevented the notice of one of the small parties which stands for the \u2018control of heights\u2018 of the economy of the country. This simply means the economy under State direction \u2013 practised in China and the old Soviet Union. That was the same economic ideology pursued by the country\u2018s military rulers in the 1970s; 1980s and early part of 1990s without enviable and enduring success. As much as State control of the economy has its own merits, the modern economic thought or behavior favour a \u2018mixed economy\u2018 template to strengthen democracy and encourage the private sector. The privatization of the PHCN is a case in point; though experience has pointed to a step taken in a hurry. It is appropriate at this juncture to return to the original question of \u2018Who will win and should win the Presidential election between the incumbent, President Jonathan (PDP) and his main challenger, Gen Buhari (rtd) of the APC. The two candidates are not new to political power \u2013 Dr. Jonathan became President in 2010 after the death of President Yar\u2018Adua and was elected in 2011, Gen Buhari became \u2018Head of State\u2018 in 1983 after overthrowing President Shagari in a military coup; he lost to Babangida in another military coup in 1985. Voting The umpire (INEC) in the contest has come up with a new gadget called the Card Reader in addition to the permanent voters card (PVC) in order, perhaps, to separate real human voters from the cattle, ghosts and fishes which appeared as voters in those dark days of rigged elections. The innovation has thrown the ruling party into a nervous stance inspite of the advantage of incumbency and other logistical electoral advantages. It is left for the Opposition to defend and standby the referee duly appointed by the President (a candidate) and approved by the Senate dominated by the PDP. However, in support of the stand of the PDP, INEC must ensure that its necessary innovation works \u2013 PVCs must reach all available registered eligible voters and the card reader must function faultlessly at the crucial times to ensure credible fair elections. In a credible and fair contest, a winner should emerge, all things being equal: In the United States, (USA) sitting Presidents have been re-elected for \u2018second term\u2018. President Obama is on his second term. Also, Clinton did two terms as a candidate of the Democrats. However, Jimmy Carter failed in his second term bid; also, Kennedy did not complete his first term before he was assassinated, and his successor Lyden Johnson completed Kennedy\u2018s term and did only one term himself. In Britain, the Iron Lady Thatcher did more than two terms but her successor, John Major could manage only one term. Also Tony Blair of the Labour party in Britain did more than two terms but Gordon Brown; his successor could manage only one term. Nothing therefore, is sacrosanct about two terms. Everything depends, as politicians often say, on favourable political climate and performance of the office holder who wants re-election. Often, party would support his nomination but would accept the verdict of the electorate. The complexity of the Presidential election on March 28, 2015 lies in the simplicity of various assumptions. The 2011 result which enthroned President Jonathan presented an interesting scenario \u2013 block votes in South-South; South-East; North-West; North-East in four of the six political zones. President Jonathan captured all the States in the south except Osun (South-west). In the North, Buhari (under CPC) could not take all the States; he was only successful in 12 States. The votes of the Yoruba state (South-west) were widely spread with Jonathan, the greatest beneficiary. The minorities of the North-Central went the Jonathan way in 2011. Many analysts see this years\u2018 contest to be centered around the South-West zone because of what is regarded as sophistication of the Yoruba voters. That sophistication which had seen the emergence of Dr. Nnamdi Azikiwe (Ibo) as member for Lagos in the Legislative Council in the 1940s and also the preference of an Ijaw (Bayelsa), Ernest Ikoli (step father of Remi-Kayode, Femi\u2018s father) to a Yoruba Ijebu (Akinsanya) for a Legislative Council seat in the 1940s. That sophistication\u2018 was still exhibited at the national level aided by Obasanjo\u2018s drawing of the Yoruba into the mid-stream of national politics before the adventure of Tinubu in rescuing the Yoruba from the mid-ocean of political uncertainty That sophistication has also been affected by the curious culture of infrastructure of the stomach. There is no doubt that Jonathan\u2018s party PDP is still strong in the South-west (thanks to Obasanjo\u2018s dismantling of myth of AD in 2003) and the ageing generation of Awo followers \u2013 the Afenifere whose romantic names weigh more than their electoral assets. The sophistication of the Yoruba voters would be effectively tested in the South-west, where Tinubu, as the effective Yoruba Leader tries to sell his new found ally, Buhari. If he succeeds, a new political alliance of greater significance for political stability of the country would have appeared. As for me, the real battle between Jonathan and Buhari lies in the pictureresque plateau and plains of the minorities \u2013 North-central State. Related",

        "text": "By Adisa Adeleye There is no doubt that Nigeria is a lovely and likeable country. Many Nigerians like their country but many patriots love their country \u2018where everything goes\u2018. Certainly, it is not unfair criticism to state that often, Nigerians place undue emphasis on things that matter less. The business of the day is the act of chasing the small document called the Permanent Voters\u2018 Card (PVC), an elusive object to some registered voters. I am yet to receive mine after repeated visits to the declared collection points. The PVC is a brain-child of Professor Attahiru Jega, Chairman of INEC. His ultimate aim is to establish the real voter for a credible election. Another Jega\u2018s instrument is the \u2018Reader\u2018 which would prove the authencity of the PVC. If it is the INEC fiat that only the carriers of PVCs would be allowed to vote, it is reasonable to expect that all registered voters are given their cards. The argument of substantial compliance by INEC in the distribution of PVC is specious. It is the responsibility of INEC to ensure that all registered voters are in possession of the PVCs. Though the arguments raised by the dust of elections postponement are yet to abate, the security issue raised at the last moment seems like a divine intervention to prevent an unforeseen tragedy. It is a pity that at the time our gallant forces are routine the murderous gang, a new offensive by their suicide bombers is being opened in other areas. THE ECONOMY It is instructive to observe that the daily pursuit of PVCs for the elections has shifted attention from the fate of the national currency which has been under siege in the last few months. The Central Bank, being overwhelmed by other monetary problems, has been trying to support the Naira. From adjustment of its value from N155/USD to N168/1USD; from N168 to N199 to a dollar, the Naira is weakening every day. The new Central Bank Governor is yet to show ingenuity in saving the Naira. The ominous sign from the Central Bank reads thus: Exchange rate \u2013 N199, Monetary Policy Rate \u2013 13 per cent (MPR) Oil Price \u2013 $61. By the time elections are held and concluded, the economic reality will look like transition into depression, high debt portfolio, increase in unemployment and widespread poverty, even with PVCs permanently stuck in our pockets. The alternative looks like further adjustments in the value of the Naira which would create money delusion, i.e. more naira will be earned from dollar value to meet the budgetary needs. It would be a case of too much money chasing too few goods and services \u2013 prelude to inflation. Obasanjo and the rest of us The celebrated Otta-chicken farmer, former military Head of State and twice elected President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, Chief Olusegun Obasanjo is the medias\u2018 delight at any time \u2013 in office, out of office, awake or in deep slumber (if he ever sleeps). Till today, Obasanjo enigmatic posture and his often theatrical displays have continued to baffle and confuse many of his critics. The seemingly reluctant head of state who took over the government in 1976 brightened the image of the military by handing over power to a democratically elected civilian government in 1979. In his book, \u201cNOT MY WILL\u2019 (Published in 1989), he notes with complete disdain. Take Zik for instance, he started his career on a very high and admirable plain as the `Zik of Africa` with a broad African outlook, broad African interest and broad African approach. He came down to West Africa and became encapsulated into Nigeria and rose to National prominence and plane before he became frustrated and ethnicised into Eastern Nigeria. He was whittled down from Zik of Africa to Zik of Ibo land. He should not end up with emphasis as the \u201cOwelle of Onitsha\u201d. \u201cChief Awolowo started on the ethnic plane because he could not compete with Zik on the national plane. Zik was obviously heads and shoulders above him on the national plane. He was crowned as the leader of the Yorubas and he never rose beyond that, inspite of his industry and administrative ability\u201d. \u201cShagari did not court power and he wanted to be nothing more than a senator which was no crime. He was pushed into power by those who wanted to make use of him and he was unfortunately too weak and somewhat ill prepared for the trappings of political power to check the abuses of his power by those who made use of him\u201d. It may be appropriate if not futile, to attempt to unmask the real characteristics of the man who is generally regarded as an enigma. To this writer, Chief Obasanjo appears a superbly confident man, highly intelligent and crafty. But behind the deceptive mask of listlessness lies the clear mind of a strategic thinker. His lack of charisma in the eyes of his more flamboyant political adversaries has been their undoing. His acerbic tongue appears to be a calculated design to throw opponents off balance before he throws a punch which could result in concorsion and abysmal pain. Chief Obasanjo, as a politician, looks like a serious planner with a mixture of intrigues and tricks. As for the unity of Nigeria, he is and always will be an incurable optimist. From his accumulated experience and judging by his recent performance on the job, are Nigerians under the spell of a redeemer? Or are we dealing with a mere opportunist at the helm of national affairs? Chief Obasanjo had suggested the answer a long time ago. \u201c:He notes in, `NOT MY WILL` (PG 226) that, `some who see themselves as been charitable say he is very lucky, those not so charitable say he is an opportunists, some friends say, `he works hard and he is good`. \u201cNone of them is totally right or correct. I believe that three ingredients must be present for success in any human endeavour, physical preparations, mental preparation including attitudinal and character, opportunity must avail itself and that may be due to luck, fate, destiny or chance. But as an old classmate of mine put it, if you are three or four times consecutively lucky, it is worthy of not if not close study\u201d The bottom line and the point to note is that success invites envy and envy is not easily cured\u201d. Perhaps chief Obasanjo will now be sitting in his living room, laughing at those commentators who are in the habit of criticizing without hearing his own side of the story. For instance, did President Jonathan seek his help to persuade the North (PDP supporters in the North) that if given a chance, he would do only one term? Related",

        "author": "Adisa Adeleye",
        "text": "By Adisa Adeleye With the Presidential election about one week away, the amusing gyrations of the political gladiators continue unabated. There is little doubt the suffering masses are presumed to be enjoying the macabre daylight dance in the market. The Boko Haram insurgents (murderers) always make their presence felt by the dastardly acts of the female suicide bombers (an innovation in Nigeria). The good news is that the country\u2019s\u2018 neighbouring States in ECOWAS have promised to help in subjugating the insurgents. The moral question is whether it is right to continue to hurl bombs or maim ourselves when others are offering their lives to ensure our survival as a nation. It would have been better if our helpers found us a united nation. Inspite of the media efforts in getting the political gladiators to focus on specific issues, the rising tempo of the current debate is on the personalities of President Jonathan and his challenger, Major General Buhari (rtd). Both contestants are not new to power \u2013 through democratic election (Jonathan) and through Coup (military democracy), Buhari. The issue should have been on the use of power and the enjoyments of democratic dividends under PDP government since 1999 and what Buhari and his party will give Nigeria in 2015 and after. So far, the topic has been glibly tackled by the two main parties, thus, deepening the confusion. It may be necessary at this time, to put a halt to the drift towards deep misunderstanding and confusion. The main issue is that the economy has been mismanaged since the return of Democracy under the ruling party Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) of which Dr. Goodluck Ebele Jonathan is the current leader. Even before the awful disclosure of Professor Charles Soludo (former Governor of Central Bank under Obasanjo), there is clear evidence that the economy has not been wisely managed as expected and that the majority of the Nigerian people have not been enjoying \u201cgood life\u201d. What are the facts of life? At present, about 70 percent of Nigerians are living below the poverty line and unemployment rate is above 24 per cent and above 30 per cent among the youths. Significant statistical figures show the value of petroleum products between 1999 and today. The pump price of gasoline (premium motor spirit) commonly called \u2018petrol\u2018 which was N26 in 1999 is now N87; diesel (AGO) sold for N19 in 1999 compared with today\u2018s cost of N155; kerosene in 1999 was N17 per litre as compared with the present subsidized price of N50, if available. It could be argued that the rise of pump price (by litre) of petroleum product could be attributed to importation of products to supplement short supply from dilapidated local refineries. The fact that a major oil producer and exporter would become an importer of the commodity it produces in abundance calls into a serious doubt, the ability of the economic management team of the nation. And to make it worse, subsidy is being paid to the importers of the refined products, product by product while it could be cheaper to refine in neighbouring refineries where a barrel of crude oil would give more than ten different products. The stench from the saga from oil subsidy, which has caused the nation more than N2 trillion is still on. Mrs. Hillary Clinton, during her visit to Nigeria once doubted the economic wisdom of importing refined oil products by a leading exporter of crude oil, and the economic stupidity of paying subsidy on imported oil. The question of payments on imports would depend on how strong the currency of the importing nation is. Commonsense economics would dictate that an import-dependent nation (like Nigeria) would go for a strong currency to overcome the situation if the need arises. Far from it, the ruling party has proved not to be a friend of a strong currency. Between 1999 and 2015, the value of the national currency has moved from N102 to the dollar to an uncertain figure of N168 and N210 to one dollar. How are the mighty falling. There are different rates for the dollar, the official rates and the parallel rates. Thus, Nigeria will appear to be operating a multiple system of foreign exchange system in its economy, i.e. one rate for the Central Bank, another for inter-bank and another for the Bureaus (BDC). Since 1999, the Federal Government, State Government and the Local Governments have relied on oil money for eighty per cent of their revenue. That source of revenue has contributed to the fiscal irresponsibility of the executives and the frivolities of the legislatures all over the country. Neither the Federal, State nor Local government has shown exceptional ability (except Lagos State) to grow internally generated revenue to match the monthly contribution from oil revenue . Even the Federal Government under the crafty but hard working Minister of Finance, Dr. Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala has started to shout austerity measures at the sign of low oil revenue. In fairness to the duo of Obasanjo and Iweala, something was \u201cillegally\u201d siphoned from oil money into Excess Crude Oil account \u2013 now a likely saviour. Unfortunately, the funds in the illegal Excess Crude Oil Account meant for \u201cPower\u201d Plants could not withstand the onslaught of powerful States under Yar`Adua and President Jonathan. Much of it had been distributed before the cruel blow to oil bonanza. The cruel oil blow (to some good omen) will, no doubt, lead to depression in the Nigerian economy which has refused to move from its dependence on oil for its sustenance and growth. To sustain the 2015 Budget, the Federal Government will certainly deep its hands into what is left of Excess Crude Oil Account, Sovereign Wealth Funds and other savings. Some measures might include borrowings and more direct investments. The problem is with a nation which is noted for frugality and impunity in its attitude to spending money, the future looks bleak. If eighty (80) per cent of revenue is devoted to recurrent expenditure, what is left for education and infrastructural development? If the Federal Government has not been able to advance beyond President Jonathan\u2018s refixing the railway system, renovating the airports, creating more universities and schools and re-investing in agriculture (credits to Jonathan\u2018s government) in the last four years, then, much is required. Jonathan\u2018s supporters are saying Give us another 4 years to complete the job. The battle cry of the Opposition is \u201cCHANGE\u201d perhaps from the dreary past and depression of the future. But, Nigerians would be interested to know if there would be a radical change from the current fiscal and monetary policies. What will be the appropriate policy on Power and Oil? The ultimate answer is needed on overall strategy for Security and Prosperity. This is the current charge to the Opposition. Related",

The choice would not be anyone\u2019s liking but the situation is strongly driven by politicians and other stakeholders. The only constitutional obligation is vote with one\u2019s conscience. Last week\u2019s primaries set the tempo for the political landscape of next year\u2019s election. The dust has hardly settled and people are pitching their tents to their favourite and choosing camps of whom they think should head Nigeria. So which way for ordinary Nigerians? What do people want if they put aside tribal, religious and political affiliations? What will become of our country and would we put nationhood first or revert to kinship and religion? If anyone dare think they can call it then they are more deluded than thought. Only time will tell and I do hope that people will show restraint and not create mayhem. Personally, I wouldn\u2019t hold my breath as the Boat of restraint has sailed a long time ago especially when it comes to common sense and decency. The emotions, pride and dogged single mindedness has stopped people from making rational choices. For those with emperor complex only their way will do or not at all. Their delusion of grandeur has got in the way of compassion for fellow Nigerians. Somehow for the love of our nationhood, I sincerely hope majority of people will show restraint. Only time will tell. We have neglected to build and are so hell bent on destroying what makes Nigeria unique: its diversity. I do understand the fear and trepidation that people have about the future. The choice of GEJ or GMB is terrifying. Soyinka this week sounded cautious and I do believe he is alluding to the fact that GMB was a military man and a Muslim. He vehemently does not endorse his candidacy. Wole Soyinka said of the APC choice as \u201cThis is no time to go back to the military mafia and go back to our vomit\u201d For those old enough to know, life under the military was driven and dictated by the Military. We had order but we\u2019re restricted when it came to freedom of speech and expression. So far as we know, this is a different time and a different situation. He is of the opinion that with GMB it is a step back in the wrong direction and he goes as far pitch his support with GEJ. Would there be unrest or we are going to return to the bad old days? Soyinka thinks so. He argues that: \u201cthe scroll of faith becomes indistinguishable from the roll call of death and he warns that even moderate religious leaders may be \u201cvicariously liable\u201d for sectarian violence in case they fail unequivocally to condemn it. He makes a lot sense to heed his observations that \u201cthe conflict between humanists and religionists had always been one between the touch of enlightenment and chains of enslavement\u201d The invisible line has been crossed many times over the years by many. We have witnessed how it has turned our people against each other and they have become detached as wickedness ensues. We see this up and down the country. People try to justify their brand of cruelty and barbarity and no matter what, even when they hide behind be it religion, tribe or political party, these people are psychopaths and beastly. Terror has no religion or tribe. They have crossed the lines and they are no longer rational and reasonable human beings. This sadly, is what is faced daily in Nigeria. If people tolerate violence regardless whether it was done to them or others, it is not acceptable and it should be repudiated strongly. People have tolerated such pernicious behaviours and crimes that they have become desensitised and the daily horrors no longer shock people, they simply shrug it off. Soyinka is right when he said of the terror \u201cthe chains are not merely visible, but cruelly palpable. All too often they lead directly to the gallows, beheadings, to death under a hail of stones\u201d. It is happening regularly and many more murdered, kidnapped, maimed and displaced by the madness called Boko Haram. Since 2009 they have blighted some part of the country, left terror and mayhem in their wake. They have killed over 9000 people and countless others are displaced becoming refugees in the country of their birth. Many in the country feel that BH is a northern problem and that has been the problem, the lack lustre attitude in responding robustly and ill equipping the army has ensured the audaciousness of these beastly creatures. So what\u2019s this got to do with presidency? Everything. Whoever leads Nigeria come 2015, will and should deal decisively with the dismantling of these murderous psychopaths. Sunday gone it was reported that the BH stormed a remote village in North-eastern Nigeria, killing at least 33 people and kidnapping at least over 100 men, women and children close to Chibok . It took days for the news to emerge as the mobile communications was destroyed from last raid by the BH. There comes a time when condolences and commiserations is not enough and this is the time to act. The world shook and took notice when over 200 girls were abducted by BH. The #BringBackourGirls campaign raised the profile world wide of the tragedy that took place in Chibok. Up on till now, the girls remain missing in spite of the government promising their safe return. The military has not been able to offer any protection, despite the deployment of soldiers supported by the air force. It is apparently clear that our army are underfunded and ill equipped to take on BH. On Wednesday a Nigerian court martial handed down death sentences to 54 soldiers who had refused to take part in an operation like as to August to recapture three towns overrun by BH. The soldiers have complained that they did not have the weapons needed to take on BH. This despite the fact that the government said that money has been pumped in to tackle the terrorists. Regardless, this present government has been slow to act and had refused to acknowledge their failure and then refused outside help. This year alone over 2000 people have been killed by BH. While the world looks on in horror, the government repeatedly failed the people and in a country like ours that is so divisive some leaders don\u2019t see this as a problem. This comes in the wake of the massacre in Pakistan killing over 145 school children. The reaction in Pakistan was that of solidarity and the steely determination to work together to destroy the terrorists. It will take a very determined leader of conviction to get rid of BH. No one person can clean up the mess that took decades.It will be a collective effort but with a a capable,conscious and committed leaders that we can eradicate the menace that is BH. I pray that peace and comfort to those who have suffered in the hands of these meanace and that security and compassion return to our land. Related",

        "text": "By Hakeem Baba-Ahmad \u201cI discovered that being a president is like riding a tiger. A man has to keep on riding or be swallowed\u201d Harry S. Truman. YOU would be forgiven if you think we are already in 2015, or thereabouts, and the election campaigns are in full swing. We are watching a drama unfold, which has many parts that are chilling in their effects. In a few days, President Jonathan will be celebrating his first year in office as a President sworn-in after an election he contested as a candidate. The quarrels over the comment made by General Muhammadu Buhari regarding the 2015 elections are unlikely to have died down by then. This will be unfortunate for a presidency eager to roll out the drums and reel out items of achievement in the transformation agenda. Just one year into a Presidency that was born of frightening rancour and deep damage to the polity, we are being reminded that we are still deep in the woods. General Buhari had said that if the 2015 elections do not substantially improve on the quality of the elections of 2011, there will be much bloodshed, and everyone will be the loser. He had chosen the Hausa adage of a fight between a dog and a monkey, in which both are substantially bloodied, and it is difficult to tell a winner. The allusion to blood has drawn the heaviest salvos, not surprisingly, from an administration and a party which are grappling with serious issues of escalating violence, and are yet to recover from the bitter and destructive reactions to the outcome of the 2011 presidential elections in parts of the north. The smell of blood in General Buhari\u2019s comment brought out all the sharks: the President\u2019s corner reminded the nation that the General is not a democrat; is un-electable; is a prophet of doom and gloom who is unfit to lead; and that he should be held solely responsible for any violence he is predicting. The PDP rolled out the big guns it reserves for big occasions, and lambasted the General in its traditional and new language. Bloodied dog, bloodied monkey The General\u2019s party and its allies rallied around him, firing back in language and with passion fit for real war. The dust is still much in the air and the meaning of \u201cbloodied dog, bloodied monkey\u201d is being very carefully scrutinised, and General Buhari is basking in a limelight he has not enjoyed since the aftermath of the 2011 elections. Even northern governors are being affected by this awesome quarrel, and they recently resolved, after their recent meeting in Kaduna, that they will facilitate the emergence of a northern candidate, presumably after they succeed in collapsing all partisan boundaries. It is important to seek for deeper reasons behind this latest outbreak of squabbles over elections. The outward manifestations of the issues are not difficult to discern. The comments he made and the reactions to them have reminded the nation that General Buhari is very much a factor in Nigeria politics. They are also strong signals that the recent talks over political and electoral alliance between the CPC and ACN represent a real threat to the PDP. Then there is the evidence that the our democratic system does not distinguish periods between governance and partisan, or electoral campaign. 2015 is upon us, whether we realise it or not. But a worrying question is one which should ask why all this heat will be generated by remarks about the linkages between elections and violence. This is certainly not the first time General Buhari will warn over the dangers of rigged elections, and it will not be his last. Nor is he the only Nigerian who believes that unless our elections successively improve the manner they reflect popular will, they will alienate more and more Nigerians, and many voters and other citizens will take up violence as a means of protesting perceived abuses of the electoral process. Who would believe that it will be all tranquility and peace if the elections of 2015 do not radically improve on 2011, and do so in a manner ordinary voters will recognise and accept? There is a basic issue about the 2011 elections which represents a serious problem. The presidency and INEC, and a substantial percentage of Nigerian citizenry says the elections were generally good, and represent a new benchmark for credible elections in Nigeria. Another significant proportion of the citizenry says they were substantially rigged, and do not reflect the popular will. Civil society is overwhelmingly critical of the elections, although it says they were better than previous ones. The international community, which has since become a major player in our electoral process, says it was acceptable, and certainly more acceptable than prolonged strife over results. Now, if you do not accept that the 2011 elections were substantially flawed, why should you go out of your way to fix them? Because Buhari says you must do it, or else blood will flow? And, conversely, why should the electoral process be so comprehensively condemned (and by implication, thoroughly reformed), because politicians who serially lose elections say they are rigged? What, or who will motivate a genuine review of the 2011 elections, and an informed and dispassionate improvement on its manifest weaknesses? INEC will say it has a routinised review mechanism, and will study all the elements of the 2011 elections, plug loopholes, and address weaknesses subject to financial and other support from government. Will that satisfy General Buhari and his supporters and the opposition? The administration will say what INEC and the democratic process need is constructive and genuine critique of our elections, and not wholesale condemnations by politicians who lose elections. It will say it is ready to work with INEC, civil society and the international community to improve upon the 2011 elections, which were, in any case, good. Will this satisfy Buhari and his supports and the opposition? Quality of politicians and electoral process The most worrying dimension of these quarrels is that they expose the links between the quality of our politicians and of our electoral process. If elections are only free and fair when we win them, and winners will emerge irrespective of the quality of the elections, and then defend the elections they may have rigged as free and fair, then we will never conduct credible and acceptable elections in Nigeria. Ordinary voters who are far from the intricate but damaging manipulations of the electoral process take their cues from the reactions of politicians who win or lose elections. On the one hand, in situations where stakes are raised to extremely high levels by politicians and supporters, suggestions of rigged elections resonate with profound consequences. On the other hand, such is the manner politicians manipulate divisive and parochial values among Nigerian voters, that few voters will question results if they satisfy narrow political goals. The way things stand now, if General Buhari changes his mind and decides to re-contest as a candidate in the 2015 presidential elections, either on his party\u2019s platform or as a coalition candidate, it is very likely that President Jonathan\u2019s yet-to-be-declared but active interest in running again win be given substance by an alliance between the south south and the south east. As if the dangerous slide we now see into parochialism is not enough, this will polarise the nation even further. To add a massive dispute over elections whose credibility is already being questioned may be too much for this nation to process. Related",

        "title": "2015: Is PDP rejoicing at the wrong time?",
        "author": "Tonnie Iredia",
        "text": "By Tonnie Iredia The Transformation Ambassadors of Nigeria (TAN) who are clamouring for a second term for President Goodluck Jonathan may have excelled in their mobilization of many Nigerians to applaud their goal. Their South-South rally in Port Harcourt the other Saturday reportedly received the blessing of over four million citizens of the zone who demand that Jonathan should contest the 2015 Presidential elections. Their earlier shows in the South-East and South-West rallies were similarly impressive. They therefore appear to have put the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in a joyous mood ahead of 2015. In fairness to the party, no one can afford to despair considering the kind of figures that are being reeled out from the TAN rallies. There is also the latest revelation that different groups supporting the President have soared from 3000 to 8000 according to Rufai Alkali Political Adviser to the President. It is probably in order that PDP members are already rejoicing over what they are seeing as the inevitable victory of President Jonathan at the coming polls. One of such optimistic members is my old classmate, Chike who tells me every other day that their party is set for victory. Every effort to draw his attention to the need for caution has been rebuffed. Interestingly, he came out the worse for it for ignoring a similar caution about being over confident concerning the recently concluded Female World Cup contest where Nigeria humiliated every opponent until the final match in which she failed to fly when it mattered most. Chike had confidently opined that Nigeria would win because her No. 4- Oshoala was unstoppable. Alas, Chike could not recover from the shock of Nigeria\u2019s defeat in the final match against Germany. Regrettably, Chike is again getting over confident about another contest- the Presidential election in Nigeria in 2015. Is his party, the PDP similarly over confident? If unfortunately she is, I just hope President Jonathan is not because there are what can be called election craters on the way to 2015 and they are many. First, to count Jonathan\u2019s support groups in thousands without a fraction is suspect. How come the groups are exactly 7000 while the number of groups awaiting recognition is also reported to be exactly 1000 or were the groups counted by the same people who always counted our people during our controversial census exercises? If so, who says the groups are not replicated and that some of the members are not also members of even opposition groups? President Goodluck Jonathan with PDP chieftains at the party\u2019s rally. Second, the members of the groups as well as some of the people in the crowds put together by TAN may have been rented- a common feature in Nigeria. At the same time, some of the crowds could just be adventurers who are ever present at every rally to see what is in there for them making it dangerous for anyone to rely on the crowds. In earnest, several segments in the crowds including the transformation ambassadors themselves might not be registered voters or may not have succeeded in passing through the needles\u2019 eye to secure the permanent voters card. Again, the typical TAN rally does not in essence add to knowledge as what we hear there is neither new nor different from the daily television slogans and jingles. The rallies would probably be better if they are less predictable. What is more, that the speakers at the rallies are mostly ministers and top government officials as well as PDP stalwarts reduces the level of credibility of the events. Indeed, the rallies look like those television documentaries which depict how great a man is by featuring his children describing him as the best dad ever- whose father? But none of the issues raised so far raised is as crucial as the fear of the referee- the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC). Recently, the commission announced thousands of additional polling stations in the country. How INEC has shared them should tell the PDP that they are probably rejoicing at the wrong time. Is the PDP familiar with \u201cgerrymandering\u201d- a term which refers to the manipulation of electoral constituencies/polling units in such a way as to influence the outcome of elections in favour of a political party? INEC says it has introduced more voting units to reduce large numbers of voters in some centres. That sounds good; but by which mathematical formula did it arrive at giving one zone in the country more additional units than six other zones put together? Is the favoured zone the place where several people are migrating to at this point in time, if not how can it deserve the chunk of additional units? Assuming INEC means well, can it guarantee what its often compromised staff will do with this new device? After all, the nation is yet to get the details of the manipulation by 2 of its suspended electoral officers in Osogbo and Obokun local government areas in the just concluded Osun governorship election. In any case, while it is wise to ensure that no voting centre has more than 500 voters, why is INEC fantasizing to be doing something new? Was the pegging of voters population at a maximum of 500 per booth not achieved as far back as 1991 by the Humphrey Nwosu led electoral body? Perhaps we need to warn that attempting to change old familiar voting centre less than 6 months before a major election is risky. It was tried during the 1999 general elections and the result gathered by this writer as an election monitor in Gombe State, was heavy fighting between 2 villages-Galumari and Rilawa. The fight was in connection with the re-location of the voting centre. Three persons who were seriously wounded during the fight were hospitalized at the Kumo General hospital. The current contentious creation of new voting units and the resultant inequitable distribution of the units should tell our political parties that while rallies to mobilize voters are expedient it is futile not to pay attention to moves that could make the election a lost battle before it begins Related",

The results are clear except in the two states of Abia and Imo whose final results remain in abeyance\u2013the election in each state was judged to be inconclusive. Though General Muhammadu Buhari (rtd) of the All Progressives Congress (APC) was declared the winner of the Presidential contests, the real hero of the March 28, 2015 election was the defeated candidate, the incumbent President, Dr. Goodluck Jonathan by his exemplary show of statesmanship. By our standard, that remains a welcome rarity. Nigeria remains united today by the grace of God and the singular act of courage by a single person who, despite electoral defeat, has shown tremendous courage to save the nation. It may be necessary, at this juncture when the election high fever is yet to come down, to attempt a simple analysis of events before the electoral saga of March 28th and April 11, 2015. Many columnists (including the respected ones), perhaps out of shock, have adopted a rather simplistic approach. Accusing fingers have been pointed at that greatly misunderstood for twice elected President of Nigeria, Chief Olusegun Obasanjo, a retired army general \u2013 without, of course, mentioning the theatrical tearing of his PDP membership card. However, in the midst of jubilation and gyration of party faithfuls in multi coloured dresses and the sorrowful stance of the election losers, one name remains golden in saving the soul of the country. President Goodluck Jonathan has turned to be a remarkable Statesman at the crucial moment. Some weeks before the election proper, Chief Olusegun Obasanjo, former military Head of State and twice elected President of Nigeria openly tore his PDP registration card to the disgust of party members. Although, the act of tearing was performed by his ward chairman, the mere act showed that the former army general was not happy with the ruling party, Peoples Democratic Party (PDP). Chief Obasanjo, during his active political days, had been able to divide the South West ethnic block voters by nurturing the Gbenga Daniels and Fayoses; and by breaking into the sacred Caliphate States of Sokoto and Kebbi; and solicited the sympathy of the Middle-Belt minorities. The party, PDP was at its nadir between 1999 and 2011. Without Chief Obasanjo\u2018s impact on PDP\u2018s electioneering campaigns in 2015, everything appeared to go into the reverse gear. It appears as if many Nigerians are yet to understand the personality of their former leader who had ruled the country three times. He was linked with the brief rule of former President, late Yar\u2018Adua and also, the emergence of Ebele Jonathan as current President. Yet, he remains totally misunderstood by the party he nourished to greater heights and also, by some politicians he had helped to prominence and financial fortunes. As late Gen Oluleye, a Yoruba noted that \u2018Obasanjo in terms of craft, he looks deceptive, but he can sketch good and bad schemes with equal celebrity. He is an expert in confrontational tactics\u201d. That is Obasanjo for you in politics. Jonathan and Buhari Those who are now blaming Obasanjo for the woes of PDP are strange fellows who are not familiar with the structure of that party and its earlier relationship with the old military junta. Now to the specific issues that appeared to have shaped the election results in many parts of the country. It is not only insecurity that has bred the Boko Haram insurgency in the North-East, but also the constant menace of armed robberies and kidnappings in the South and ritual killings all over the country. The widespread social cleavages and the rise in religious and ethnic tensions have frightened the minorities in many states and created doubts about a united country, called Nigeria. The struggle for political dominance among the major tribes (including the Ijaw) is worsening day by day and has put the security of the country in serious danger. The result of the presidential elections is clear \u2013 North West, North East and South West as one block against the South East and South South as another block. This is the dangerous position that existed before and during the civil war of 1967-1970. Perhaps those clamouring for a government of national unity have their strong political points. The idea is to prevent a divided nation. The economy It may be that the puzzling economic scenario contributed to the halt of the stormy reign of the PDP from 1999 to March 28, 2015 (the date of presidential and national assembly elections). The economic indicators were unfavourable to the ruling party. The unemployment rate of about 29 per cent was too high compared to 3 to 10 per cent in developed economies. The weakened currency \u2013 about N200 to an American dollar and unfriendly cost of funds to domestic industry did not help matters. Adherence to the policy of relying solely on oil revenue as the mainstay of the economy, and payment of subsidy on imported petroleum products told little favourable tale about wise management of the economy. Erratic power supply has brought no succor to economy growth. My thought It is now being realized, more than any time before, that the country needs unity in an atmosphere of prosperity. The eyes of Nigerians are now fixed on President Elect, Gen Mohammadu Buhari (rtd), who though not a magician, would be expected to fix the enduring political and economic problems of Nigeria and bring the desired political unity on his attainment of office on May 29, 2015. On political side, he would be expected to bring Nigerians of diverse tribes and religions together as one to move the country forward. It is a pity that after the civil war, we seem, like the French Bourbons, to have \u201clearnt nothing and forgotten nothing\u201d. Every politician sees every opportunity as a means of making good for self and advances the fortunes of his ethnic and religious associates. The consequence of that attitude is responsible for the growth of mistrusts and hatred among the people. Also, it has created economic gulf between the rich and the poor in what is now known as a DIVIDED COUNTRY. It is not too much for Nigeria to seek for unity in diversity and peace and prosperity in a viable and strong polity. Many are doubtful if heavy responsibilities of the country could be ably carried on the shoulders of a single political party, even if that party is divinely endowed. It is in the interest of this that politicians in their joy and sorrow would forget temporary political advantages and work for unity and prosperity. Related",

        "author": "Rotimi Fasan",
        "text": "By Rotimi Fasan ONE of the cherished traditions of developed democracies is the creation of fora for contestants to public office to sell their programmes to the electorate before live audiences. Contestants present their party\u2019s manifestoes and planned activities on attaining power in form of debates that are often transmitted live to audiences via the broadcast media. These events are organized and moderated by select members of the mass media and others, not party partisans. This is especially the case for contestants to high offices like that of president. Since the 1960s, no presidential election takes place in America without a presidential debate. It is just a convention of American democracy that is now widely accepted and practiced the world over. It may not be a constitutional requirement but no candidate into elective office who wishes to be taken seriously spurns it. This, however, is not the case in Nigeria where candidates standing for office brazenly refuse to show up for scheduled debates. We saw this during the last governorship election in Osun State. Where these candidates are not contesting the right of any person or group to make them debate but questioned the impartiality of the organizers. All of this because the convention of holding political debates as opposed to throwing unguided verbal abuses, insults and tantrums, is still commonly accepted in the media that should take the lead in promoting it, to say nothing of it being accepted by political parties and the general public. Once such ideas are mooted, those aware of their electoral deficits immediately start looking for means of discrediting it. Yet, debates like these are avenues through which the electorate can take direct measure of people seeking their support into elective office. It is one way of assessing the intelligence and preparedness, not necessarily the oratorical abilities, of contestants to public office. The electing public is better advised on how to use their votes through such avenues as political debates. They can easily tell who the temperamental candidates are, apart from the dissembling ones. By their responses and general comportment, the electorate is more likely to identify a potential failure in office, a common but eloquent liar as opposed to a well-informed and intelligent candidate who lacks a gift of the grab. Indeed, in a so-called presidential democracy like ours that is devoid of the vigorous debates of parliamentary democracies, occasional opportunities offered by presidential debates to scrutinize candidates at close quarters should be compulsory and ought to be embraced with both hands. This was why I asked in this column, last week, when the two main contestants for the position of president in the February 14 election would have their opportunity to sell their programmes to Nigerians. They should, in the fashion of sales persons, tell Nigerians what they have in stock for them in the more sedate atmosphere of guided debates, not the cacophony of crowded campaign venues. This is a matter that Nigerians must insist on because once the candidates transform into office holders they are hardly ever accountable to anyone. Nigerians should, therefore, have the opportunity to put them to test now and, in future, hold them to their promises in the event of non-compliance. That is one way to deepen our democracy. And in this wise, the print and broadcast media, civil society groups and NGOs, must cast aside their individual and group allegiances and take the lead on behalf of the general public in bringing these people before the public. Let is not be said that all the media is interested in is holding elaborate public events to confer titles of \u2018Man of the Year\u2019, \u2018Person of the Year\u2019 etc, on dubious public holders whose influence on Nigerians are measurable only in the negative. This is your time now, Vanguard, Thisday, The Nation, Daily Trust, Daily Sun, Daily Times, Punch, Nigerian Tribune, The Guardian, Alaroye, Radio Nigeria, NTA, AIT, Raypower, Channels, STV, CTV etc, this is your time to tell Nigerians that you are truly on their side in this business of nation building. In just about 17 days Nigerians will be electing their president for the next four years, but outside the reckless verbal missiles that are being thrown in all directions by political candidates and their hired mouthpieces, nothing substantial or practical is being said about the different manifestoes being hawked around by the different parties. This past week and the week before it was dominated with accusations and counter-accusations about the academic qualifications of General Mohammadu Buhari. When it looked like the questions being raised by the PDP was being answered the issue was again driven in an entirely different direction. Meanwhile, both presidential candidates of the APC and the PDP went apace with their campaigns even as news of increasing violence pours in. All of this in spite of the peace accord endorsed by both candidates. There ought to be opportunities to bring these candidates before panels of seasoned interviewers where they can tell Nigerians more about themselves, their parties and the manifestoes of their parties. They should be made to explain in clear terms what they have done and/or intend to do in office beyond the empty campaign rhetoric and meaningless verbiage. Goodluck Jonathan and Muhammadu Buhari should be brought face-to-face to explain to Nigerians how they have or do intend to tackle the practical issues of insurgency, steep downturn in our economic fortunes and pervasive corruption in high places in the country. Other issues that are personal in nature can be addressed in the impartial atmosphere of moderated debates without the bitter ill-will or malevolence of venal party supporters. On this issue of presidential debates, I insist the media and civil society groups have a major if not the sole responsibility of making them possible. There is nothing to suggest that either of the leading candidates will desire this. But that is not a decision for them but the Nigerian electorate to make. They can\u2019t be contestants and umpire all at once. There are burning issues of national importance that cannot and should not be allowed to go unaddressed before these February elections. These issues cannot be addressed in the staged condition of presidential chats or the acrimonious context of town hall meetings of gawking or paid admirers. We have seen the contestants. We have heard their mea culpas, and their hired \u2018loudspeakers\u2019 and thugs. Two weeks to the elections, it is time that Buhari and Jonathan took to the floor before the Nigerian electorate and debate each other man to man, candidate to candidate. Related",

        "text": "THE Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria entitles the president to run for a term of four years renewable for another four. This means, barring death or impeachment, the president of Nigeria can serve for a maximum period of eight years. Anyone who expects a sitting president of Nigeria to lose re-election and serve only one term in this day and age is fooling himself. If, as many believe, Goodluck Jonathan is going to run for re-election in 2015, then the next president of the Federal Republic of Nigeria will be Goodluck Jonathan. Foregone conclusion: It really makes no difference if my bluntness offends some people, especially those who have put their broken eggs in the APC basket. I am not a Goodluck Jonathan supporter and have never been and will never be a card-carrying member of the PDP. All I do is call it as I see it; and this is what I see quite clearly: the result of the 2015 presidential election will be declared the day Goodluck Jonathan finally declares his candidacy. That is the reality of Nigerian politics today. President Goodluck Jonathan\u2019 Once Jonathan declares his candidacy, all those currently seeing visions of an APC victory will quickly wake up from their slumber. Those currently sitting on the fence will be constrained to fall in line behind him. Many of those already signing marriage contracts with the APC will soon start filing for divorce. There will be a scramble to identify with Jonathan so as not to be without good luck come 2015, when it will be payback time. People like the Speaker Aminu Tambuwal, who have one foot in PDP and another in APC, will have hell to pay. One thing is for certain; Tambuwal will no longer be Speaker come 2015. Nigerian politicians are not suicidal. They are limited liability companies. They are only interested in \u201cnumber one.\u201d They know there are no cigars for losers. The governors that left PDP left because they had no future in the PDP. All but one of them cannot stand again for re-election. Those PDP governors standing for re-election are acutely aware that INEC has strategically scheduled the presidential election before the gubernatorial elections in 2015. That means sitting governors that don\u2019t play a prominent part in Jonathan\u2019s magical re-election can look forward to disaster in their own primaries or elections. Those who have jumped ship to the APC can expect an invitation to dinner by the EFCC sooner than later, in the tradition of Femi Fani-Kayode. We were not told Rabiu Kwankwaso was fraudulent while he was still a PDP governor. However, now that he has moved over to the opposition, the president has been quick to blow his cover concerning campaign contributions and local government funds. If you don\u2019t think that is telling, think again. Once the president finally declares his candidature, the prodigal sons of the PDP will quickly return home in repentance, their tails hanging between their legs. Harsh reality: We can be as idealistic as we want. But we need to face realities. We have not reached the age where a sitting president loses re-election in Nigeria. It has never happened before and it is not going to happen in 2015. When we finally reach the stage for that \u201cabnormal\u201d departure, the sitting president will not be dethroned by an opponent from a ragtag coalition of yesterday\u2019s men, belonging to parties with over-weight political baggage and without effective foothold in major parts of the country. Nigerian politicians know Jonathan cannot lose the next election, which is why the contention has not been about the election itself, but about the fact that Jonathan should not run for re-election. Those who have been shouting themselves hoarse that Jonathan should not run know that all hope of defeating him will be lost should he declare his candidacy. People like Junaid Mohammed and Ango Abdullahi are not putting their hopes on Jonathan\u2019s defeat at the polls. They know that is just not going to happen. They are relying on defeating him by dissuading him from running with threats and intimidation. Some, like Murtala Nyako, even go as far as declare that there will be civil war should Jonathan decide to run. That is not the position of democrats. That is the position of pretender bull-dog revolutionaries. Unfortunately for them, Jonathan has refused to be intimidated by vain threats of mayhem. Northern agenda: The Northern cabal made a song and dance about dethroning Jonathan in the PDP primaries of 2011. After so much drama, they came up with the perfect challenger: Atiku Abubakar; a former vice-president with widespread political connections and ubiquitous political machinery. However, politically-experienced Atiku lost the PDP primaries by a landslide to \u201cinexperienced\u201d Jonathan. If favourite-son Atiku could lose so woefully to Jonathan in 2011 when the president was a political neophyte, Northern strategists know they don\u2019t have any hope against Jonathan in 2015, after he would have been in power for six years. South-West battle These people know what many Nigerians don\u2019t seem to know. Elections in Nigeria are not televised. The more you see, the less you see. Nobody has been able to explain to me the basis of the miracle whereby a PDP presidential candidate gets over 2 million votes in riverine Rivers State. By all accounts, no election takes place in many places in Nigeria, nevertheless, \u201cfantabulous\u201d results are declared. Supporters of Buhari should read the tea-leaves. How long will it take before they realise a Buhari presidency is a pie-in-the-sky? With every election Buhari has run, he has lost more woefully than the last one. With every election he has lost, he has gone in protest all the way to the Supreme Court, but to no avail. There is nothing like fourth time lucky for Buhari. The \u201cluck\u201d is on the side of this man called Goodluck. That is why we have this frivolous talk about dogs and baboons soaking in blood come 2015. Bola Tinubu should watch his back. He is now an aspiring national politician, but he needs to secure his home-base. The PDP can orchestrate his dethronement in the South-West. That has happened before and it can happen again. The more resources Tinubu devotes to fighting at the centre, the less he has for fighting at home. The PDP took over in Kano. They can also take over in Lagos especially now that the popular Fashola is going to be out of the way. Check the statistics: the PDP has never for once conceded Lagos to Tinubu. They have given him a run for his money in every election. In 2007, the South-West did not vote for Tinubu\u2019s Atiku. They voted instead for PDP\u2019s Yar\u2019Adua. In 2011, they did not vote for Tinubu\u2019s Ribadu. Neither did they endorse his late-night romance with Buhari. They voted instead for PDP\u2019s Goodluck Jonathan. This should tell the political astute that, even in the best of times, Tinubu has no coat-tails in the South-West at the presidential level. Northerners are very wily and astute politicians. In spite of the noise coming from some of their ranks, they know that an election that fails yet again on the platform of \u201cpower must return to the North\u201d will be inimical to future Northern presidential ambitions. For this reason, I predict that even the North will be voting for Jonathan come 2015. Indeed, there will be no Northern opposition to Jonathan\u2019s candidature in the PDP this year. Any Northerner who dares to run against Jonathan in the PDP primaries will mortgage his foreseeable future in the party. That person will forfeit Jonathan\u2019s possible anointing as his successor in 2019. What this means is that the pivotal election in Nigeria will not be the 2015 presidential election, as many currently anticipate. The result of the 2015 election is already a foregone conclusion. The pivotal election will be the 2019 presidential election when a sitting president will be out of the way. Even then, that election will only be exciting if the APC survives defeat in 2015. All the indications suggest that the APC may end up as a one-election coalition. The APC is a collection of sworn enemies who don\u2019t see eye-to-eye but are tolerating one another in the meantime just for the sake of capturing the presidency. Fair-weather friends Recently, I saw a photograph of Tinubu making a speech, with Buhari looking at him. I felt like giving a penny for Buhari\u2019s thoughts. Does anybody really believe Buhari likes Tinubu beyond the next election? Does anybody really believe that, as a result of some overnight metamorphosis, Atiku Abubakar is now suddenly enamoured of Tinubu? Atiku was Tinubu\u2019s ACN presidential candidate in 2007, but ACN voters ditched him and supported Yar\u2019Adua. What of Tinubu, does anybody really think Tinubu likes Ribadu? Ribadu was Tinubu\u2019s ACN presidential candidate in 2011, but Tinubu ditched him at the last minute first for Buhari and then for Jonathan. What makes anybody believe Tinubu will not ditch the APC presidential candidate in 2015, if that is the price he has to pay to hold on to his base in the South-West? Let\u2019s not forget this for one single minute: these guys are politicians. Politicians are unscrupulous. They make friends of convenience today that become enemies tomorrow once the friendship becomes inconvenient. All this is without apology to those wishful-thinkers who would like the 2015 election to be decided by the voters. They would like the election to be based on the issues. They would like to think religious affiliation would not be a determinant in the election. They would not like regional or ethnic affiliation to be a factor. They would like to believe presidential incumbency will not be the deciding factor. Well, I have news for them. If wishes were horses, then beggars would ride. The 2015 presidential election in Nigeria will not be held in a foreign country. It will be held in Nigeria. Therefore, the election will go as usual according to plan. Goodluck Jonathan will not only win in 2015, he will do so by a \u201cmoonslide.\u201d Related",

        "text": "By Josef Omorotionmwan GOING by the lessons of history, it is clear that the cane reserved for Iyale (the first wife) shall someday be used on Iyawo (the new wife). At the very height of the reign of terror in the Second Republic, the Umaru Dikkos of this world employed the police and other security agencies to hound perceived political opponents. In a quick twist of fate, the same security agencies were on hand, in due season, to also pull down the maximum rulers from their exalted positions, to the extent that the hands of the same security agencies were bold enough on the wooden crate in which the same Umaru Dikko was later to be consigned as cargo from England to Nigeria. By 1581, the people of Dutch Netherlands had become totally fed up with the high-handedness of King Philip II of Spain. That was why they foreswore their allegiance to him and established the Dutch Republic. They justified their revolt on the ground that Philip had destroyed their liberties and treated them as slaves. The moral lesson here is that, the moment an administration becomes tyrannical, its subjects have a right to depose it. Indeed, nothing lasts forever, not even a jungle administration! The visible signs of the 2015 war already provide a most frightening glimpse. We must be worried that the presidency is gradually descending into despotism as it has become an army of occupation everywhere, with open assault on our freedom of expression and the press. Eight full months to the war, they have deployed their major arsenals to the various war fronts. In recent times, they have embarked on steps that are purely reminiscent of the dirty politics of yester-years. For them, Edo State must be captured by all means and at all costs! The push has started. Being deaf to history, they have retreated to their 1987 position, where their forebears, the NPN, had planned to capture the entire country. As we speak, Edo State is under siege. With the instrumentality of the so-called federal might, a microscopic minority in the House of Assembly has ousted an overwhelming majority and today, they speak with impunity about the PDP Speaker and the APC Speaker; the PDP Assembly and APC Assembly. At the weekend, the army of occupation moved into the House of Assembly premises and sacked everyone in sight \u2013 both workers of the Assembly and contractors who were engaged in some renovation work \u2013 after giving them the beating of a life time. The other day, we watched helplessly while Governors Chibuike Amaechi of Rivers State and Adams Oshiomhole of Edo State were constructively prevented from travelling to Ado-Ekiti, the Ekiti State Capital to attend a political rally organised by their party, the APC, two days to the election in the State. Amaechi\u2019s plane was allowed to land in Akure but his convoy was intercepted at the boundary between Ekiti and Ondo states by soldiers \u201cwho were acting on orders from above\u201d. His aircraft was also later prevented from flying out of Akure. Oshiomhole\u2019s chopper was prevented from flying out of Benin Airport by soldiers who claimed they were acting on instructions from above. For similar reasons, the aircraft that took the national leader of the APC, Asiwayi Tinubu, to Akure was equally grounded at the Akure airport, thus preventing him from flying back to Lagos in the aircraft. It is only a fool that would argue with a mad man with a gun. A few days to the Ekiti election, a police officer threatened to shoot Governor Kayode Fayemi. It was even worse in Benin City where we saw a rookie with his fingers on the trigger, reigning abuses on the Speaker of the Edo State House of Assembly, Uyigue Igbe, and threatening to shoot him. And this was at the premises of Edo State House of Assembly \u2013 property of Edo State Government, not the Federal Government\u2019s. A few weeks ago, the army of occupation took over the print media and armed soldiers detained delivery vehicles and confiscated bundles of newspapers across the country on the pretext of searching for bombs or materials for making bombs. Soldiers invaded the vendors\u2019 distribution centres in Abuja and stopped the circulation of newspapers in the Federal Capital Territory, in utter defiance of the constitutional guarantees for free speech, free press and free movement. Everything meets at a point: the greatest foolery comes from doing, even with the greatest dexterity, that which ought not to be done. This shows up in various aspects of our lives. Any wonder that the entire country has been totally consumed by insecurity? By the time we dispatch our police and military personnel to the Houses of Assembly, street corners of state capitals and other innocuous places where they are least required, we would have virtually nothing to send to the Sambisa forest. So, Boko Haram would continue to have a field day. Elsewhere, it is possible to strip the word despot of all ugly connotations. In the age of enlightened despotism, the true despot was the servant of his people, exercising his power solely for their good; and recognising their welfare as his own. There were two methods by which society was regenerated \u2013 one, a slow and laborious method that depended upon the gradual spread of enlightenment until it reached all classes and individuals in society. The second, promising swifter results were set in motion when a wise ruler suddenly embarked on necessary laws for social harmony. An enlightened ruler, provided his powers were adequate, could reorganise and reinvigorate the life of a nation by a few well-reasoned programmes and thus earn the gratitude of his people. The same sun beats the tortoise and its seller. If we must get to 2015, shall we not be interested in having people to rule over when we get there? It cannot be by the oppression, suppression or repression of the citizens. Force may only succeed for a while, not forever. And the tree of liberty shall be watered by the blood of tyrants! Related",

        "author": "Tonnie Iredia",
        "text": "By Tonnie Iredia A few years back, the Americans were reported to have predicted that Nigeria may not survive a likely turmoil in 2015. The date obviously gives a political undertone to the problem considering that it coincides with when our next general elections are due. The significance of the prediction does not lie in the maker as those who perceive America as omniscience would want the nation to believe. After all, France and indeed some of our own prophets/soothsayers were reported to have also seen \u2018visions\u2019 which corroborated the alarm. The truth is that anyone who has followed the history of Nigerian elections can easily have such expectations. In the last one week however, some rather soothing remarks on the subject have been credited to our President, Dr. Goodluck Jonathan and 2 former Heads of State-General Yakubu Gowon and former President Ibrahim Babangida (IBB). To the positive views of these statesmen, I would love to say a loud Amen and proceed to wish our nation well. But because wishes are hardly coterminous with reality, it appears ill-advisable to rely on wishes. Again, those who think prayers would do the magic have to bear in mind the common saying that \u2018heaven helps those who help themselves. In other words, prayers alone may not be sufficient especially if some of our compatriots as usual, choose to be reckless about how they handle our numerous centrifugal forces. For instance, we are all aware that the fabric of solidarity which binds our heterogeneous society together is not only fragile but tends to stretch to breaking point at the slightest provocation. Yet, our people, especially the political class, always put our country through constant threat of dismemberment. Although President Jonathan has said several times that it is premature and distractive to get involved in electioneering until next year, the nation is already broken into 2 irreconcilable groupings concerning his role in 2015 elections. And whereas the first group which is a large portion of the south appears ready to die if the President is not re-elected, the second group-another large portion of the North seems ready to bring the world to an end if power does not shift to the North in 2015. Unfortunately, the show down is virtually inevitable because of the lucrative nature of politics and the winner-takes-all political system that we run. For how long will our nation survive, when with little or no work, a tiny elite group appropriates so much to itself while an exceedingly large segment of the population is left prostrate? The other day, one political analyst made a rather uncharitable classification of the nation. He said everyone knows what it takes to become a judge, a medical doctor, a professor and indeed any professional practitioner. The politician on the other hand, gets to fame, according to the analysis, through several question channels such as illiteracy, fake certificates, thuggery and all forms of duplicity. The question as to which of the two groups is better recognised and remunerated in Nigeria for its contribution to national development does not arise because the politicians themselves do not quite know how much they earn. They just expropriate. Why will politics not be a do or die game and who says Nigeria cannot break on account of politics? The powerful Nigerian political class can in earnest do and undo. If the group or even just one of them organizes a function in our collectively owned Abuja these days, the only roads that would not be shut on the day by our eye-service law enforcement agents would be the few leading straight to the venue of the event. No one works or goes anywhere that day. How can the Nigerian bureaucracy be efficient or effective when the system of recruitment has been gravely corrupted? Interestingly, we hear only about the scandalous sale of job placements. The other condemnable dimension of the numerous deficient recruits that are imposed on institutions by the powerful are taken as the entitlement of the latter. Indeed, the same powerful occasionally sets up panels to probe only the jobs that are sold. No one can question the political class as public policies weaken only the powerless For instance, in order to make the apprehension of criminals easy, persons who own factory fitted \u2018tokunbo\u2019 tinted glasses are made to register their cars officially with the police supposedly at no cost. The people and the authorities are however aware that the powerless pay no less than N25, 000 per vehicle at the designated centres for the assignment. As part of transforming Nigeria, the Immigration Service now officially renews an international passport at the same cost of acquiring a new one. It is probably for the same reason that the Federal Road Safety Commission has decreed that fresh and increased expenditures have to be borne for the procurement of newly designed vehicle plate numbers. In major cities, landlords are passing to their tenants, increases occasioned by ground rent, tenement rate, facility fee and water rate to mention a few. In Abuja, parking fees by different collecting agencies are being imposed on the people although there are no parks. Based on these issues, which could obviously weaken the weak beyond weakness, it can be argued that Nigeria may not break physically but in the sub consciousness of the weak, the break happened mentally years ago. To the privileged class however, these are non-issues because they happen elsewhere and are reportedly temporary sacrifices for development. Last month, I was at a workshop where some of the speakers blamed the nation\u2019s woes on the media. According to them, journalists as patriots ought to be engaged in advocacy journalism by projecting their country only in good light. During the question and answer session, the key note speaker declined to respond to my question as to what he considered the best way for a journalist to report a public event like the process arranged by our 36 governors to elect a chairman for the Nigerian Governors Forum. He just said that was politics. I understood him to mean that whether Nigeria would survive over time depends on politics. Related",

        "author": "Uche Onyebadi",
        "text": "By Uche Onyebadi THERE is no denying the fact that 2014 was a year few Americans will be in a hurry to forget. It was a year in which the infamous Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS) raised brutality to higher pedestals with the decapitation of innocent Americans and people of other nationalities in the name of religion and other banalities the group claims to represent. Less inhuman but equally bizarre was the action of North Korea in freeing two Americans, Matthew Miller and Kenneth Bae, who were held in very confounding circumstances. It was also a year in which the world got to know the extent to which U.S. interrogators used torture as a preferred instrument to extract what was questionably called \u201cactionable intelligence\u201d from captured members of various international terrorism groups. As the year wound up, President Obama displayed unusual boldness in extending a diplomatic hand of friendship to Cuba, a long-standing enemy nation. Perhaps, three major incidents had the most profound impact on U.S. internal affairs in 2014. One incident was the killing of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri, by a somewhat trigger-happy policeman. The passions inflamed by that incident were further exacerbated when jurors found no probable cause to send the policeman to trial. Powerful catalysts for nation wide protests The same verdict was reached in the case of Eric Garner who died when arresting policemen used the chokehold method banned by their department to subdue him. Reports of such police killings are nothing new in police-public relations in the U.S. but these two incidents were powerful catalysts for nation-wide protests against excessive use of force by policemen in the course of duty. The fact that minorities are often the targets of such police action did not help matters. The second impactful incident was the mid-term election in November, 2004. Results from the polls reduced the Democrats to playing second fiddle in both Senate and House of Representatives. The new political power equation in the U.S. leaves President Obama vulnerable to all sorts of political maneuvers by the majority Republican lawmakers. For the past two years, Republicans have been licking the wounds inflicted upon them when Democrats passed the healthcare bill into law. With their new majority in Congress, Republicans are poised to chip away as many sections of the law as they can. On the other hand, the White House has already made it clear that the president will not sign any legislation that will decimate his signature achievement. The third area is the U.S. economy. According to the New York Times, the nation\u2019s economic growth rate for the third quarter of 2014 was 3.9 percent. When the Bureau of Labour Statistics released the unemployment figure for November, 2014 and it held at 5.8 percent, very few people were surprised, given the rate at which the economy was growing. Today, the price of gas remains around $2 per gallon, about half of what it cost barely a year ago. My point is that these economic giant steps are not celebrated either in the media or by the Obama White House. The impression still being created by the opposition and conservative media is that the president is not doing enough to resuscitate the U.S. economy. But the contrary is the case. The U.S. economy is enjoying what has eluded it in the past six or more years. The Gallup polls between December 29, 2014 and January 2, 2015, shows that Obama has a job approval rating of 48 percent, far more than what he had a few months ago. Yet, there is hardly any nation-wide visible ovation about how the president is doing his job. Unlike 2014, this year promises to be a year of politics. Aside from the looming battle between President Obama and Democrats on one side and Republican Congressmen and women on the other, the race for the 2016 presidential election will commence sooner than later. No candidate worthy of the race can afford to remain in the closet much longer. Hillary Clinton will have to publicly announce her rather well-known intention to run for the high office which no female has ever occupied since the U.S. became independent. The Republicans are still undecided as to who will be their front-runners. But, it is a group that will include Jeb Bush, former governor of Florida and younger brother of former President George Bush. Others in the line-up are Bobby Jindal, governor of Louisiana, Senators Marco Rubio (Florida) and Rand Paul (Kentucky), Rick Perry, governor of Texas and Mike Huckabee, former governor of Arkansas and presidential primaries contender in 2008. There is even talk that two-time presidential contender, Mitt Romney, might join the fray for the third time. It would appear that the most exciting and tough presidential fight will be between Hillary Clinton and Jeb Bush. Should both win their respective primary elections, the epic presidential battle will be a re-match of the 1992 election between Jeb\u2019s father, George H.W. Bush and Hillary\u2019s husband, Bill Clinton. Both Hillary and Jeb will come into the race with solid credentials and are likely to run issues-oriented campaigns as opposed to the ideological baggage and mudslinging other candidates will bring to the table. I will like to see Hillary and Jeb contest the 2016 U.S. presidential election; happier still if at the end of the day, Hillary becomes the first woman to sit in the Oval Office at White House as Madam President.

        "author": "Yinka Odumakin",
        "text": "By Yinka Odumakin MALLAM Audu used to have a kiosk as you crossed from Moremi Hall to Awolowo Hall in Ife in those days. We bought little items from from the wares he displayed close to the health centre. After payment was made, Audu was usually not so quick with giving out the change, so, we would yell at him in our smattering knowledge of the Hausa Language: \u201cMallam,bani Changi! For all those persuaded that all we needed to bring about CHANGE in Nigeria is one man of integrity while keeping the crooked structure that survives only on the oxygen of corruption must be screaming \u201cBani changi!\u201d after going through the 2016 budget proposals laid before the joint session of the National Assembly recently. President Buhari himself betrayed the limitations of what one man\u2019s moral can do in a totally depraved system when he revealed during his maiden media chat that he refused the sum of N400m appropriated to buy cars for him but that his officials persuaded him to accept, that cars be purchased for use of visiting heads of state and all that when the dire straits we are in compels that we rely on hired taxis to receive such people so they would know that we are not in party mood. By the time they were done, the Presidency whose head felt buying cars should not be our priority now is to spend N3.6b on Salon cars. Presidency\u2019s mockery of the times There are many other expenditure items in the presidency that are scandalous and mock the times that we are in. There is the N189.1m voted for tyres for various vehicles, including the bulletproof and plain Mercedes Benz cars being used in the Presidency. The budget for the Presidency has been raised to N39b from N24.4b in the 2015 budget with N1,415,706,197 devoted to both local and international travels as against N944m spent in 2015. We should be spending more time to find home-grown solutions to our problem given the global economic turmoil that we are witnessing. At a time when we are not sure if human beings would be able to feed, the N24m budgeted for the purchase of exotic animals in 2015 has been increased to N326m in 2016. A further breakdown of the 2016 budget for the Presidency includes other ridiculous headings such as : general renovation of the Guest House (N387m); complete furnishing of the Guest House (N45m); purchase of computers (N27.5m) and construction and provision of recreational facilities at N764m. Other insensitive expenditures on the Presidency\u2019s vehicles include N39.8m for the purchase of an unspecified number of 200 amps, 100 amps and 60 amps Mercedes Benz batteries for bulletproof vehicles while N30m is to be expended on the purchase of tool boxes, car jacks, and diagnostic machines for bulletproof cars. The purchase of C-Caution triangles, fire-extinguishers and cables is to cost N27m. The uproar generated nationally in 2015 over the N1billion budget for food in the villa did not stop the almost 100% increase on the same heading to N1.75billion in 2016 at a time \u201cfellow Nigerians\u201d are being summoned to tighten their belts! File: Buhari during the 2016 budget presentation to NASS Insensitive expenditure In the same vein, the acquisition of presidential canteen materials and kitchen equipment increased from N83.1m in 2015 to N89m in 2016. Where are those purchased last year? We have not been told yet that the last occupiers of Aso Rock went away with kitchen equipment and as such it is sheer waste to make such an item a recurrent expenditure. A whopping sum N114.4m is to be expended on the upgrade of internet infrastructure in the State House with another N22.5 to be spent on purchasing internet servers. In what appears as cooking up items to justify frittering of resource, a nebulous \u201cActive Devices for State House Network\u201d is to cost N100m and N35m is to be expended on the purchase of security appliances and licences, including computer anti-virus software. God have mercy! The binge continues, the Office of the National Security Adviser where out of the N90.3 billion budget for 2016, N8.7 billion is to be expended to develop the ONSA\u2019s \u201cAll-Eye\u201d surveillance project and N9 billion to construct a salacious b \u201cStravinsky Project\u201d. Securing the nation The ONSA\u2019s security vote, including funds for operations, is put at N576m. The Department of State Security Service (DSS) has N2.2 billion for its 2016 security vote. The Presidential Air Fleet is to spend N262.4m on Air Navigation equipment. Other wasteful items under the Presidency\u2019s 2016 budget include: N55,670,000 for installation or budget planning software; N272,646,891 for Upgrading of mechanical and electrical power line (underground) supplies to the State House; N322,421,971 for linking of cable to drivers\u2019 rest room at Villa Admin and N213,873,953 for linking of cable from House No 9 Generator House to the gate. The craze continues with N618,604,265 for installation of electrical lightings and fittings; N191,592,132 for electrical installation of distribution boards and other cables; N22,861,449 for provision of stage curtains and electrical drive; N10,416,146 for installations of electrical materials and luminaries. There have been a lot of rhetorics about \u201cdiversification \u201d of the economy to the point that people were expecting that the 2016 budget would pay serious attention to non-oil sources especially the solid mineral sector. Alas, only a paltry N9b was voted for solid mineral, just a quarter of the N40b that has been earmarked to search for oil in the Lake chad at a time when IMF has projected that oil may fall to $20 a barrel as against our $38 projection. Peradventure oil is found in the North East, who is going to invest in the place given the security situation in that area? This is at best a sentimental voyage! The President was right when he said that there is the need to secure Nigeria and then manage it. But we also need to manage what resources we devote to securing the country. We have N294.5 billion budgeted for the Ministry of Defence,the Ministry of Interior has a budget of N145.2b, Nigerian Police Formation and Command has N283.09 billion. There is another N10b voted for Operation Lafiya Dole. If the four items are added with the N57.7 billion voted for the office of the National Security Adviser we have N799.04 billion devoted to security out of a N6.08 trillion! Neglect of Agriculture There is no rationale for the N39 billion voted for the Ministry of Information in the 2016 budget as against the N9 billion allocated to the same Ministry in 2015. Are we to consume more propaganda in this appropriation year? It boggles the mind further when it is realised that the N39.1billion allocated to the Information is more than the combined budgets of Ministry of Transportation N13.7 billion, Ministry of Water Resources N7.2 billion and the Ministry of Industry, Trade and Investment N10.5 billion. The Information Ministry also has a higher vote than the Ministry of Agriculture N29 billion and Solid Mineral N9 billion. Yet, these are two key ministries crucial to diversification of our economy to meet the challenges of our reality. It is doubtful if our policy makers came across Rick Rowden\u2019s article titled \u201cAfrica\u2019s Boom Is Over\u201d where he opined as follows: Today, I\u2019m sorry to say, it looks like the skeptics were right. Oil and commodity prices are plunging, China\u2019s purchases are slowing, and GDP growth rates across the continent are in steep decline. Reflecting these trends, the IMF has cut its 2015 projection for growth in sub-Saharan Africa from 4.5 to 3.75 percent, concluding that the decade-long commodity cycle that had raised African export revenues \u201cseems to have come to an end.\u201d With a population boom on the horizon, experts now worry about how the continent will produce enough jobs for its people. Africa and arrested development Africa\u2019s plight is reflected by developments in its two leading economies, Nigeria and South Africa, which together account for 55 percent of the 48 sub-Saharan African nations\u2019 GDP, and which have both been particularly hard hit by falling mineral and oil prices. Nigeria\u2019s growth rate has slumped to 2.4 percent in the second quarter, the slowest pace in at least five years, while South Africa\u2019s economy contracted by an annualised 1.3 percent as power shortages curbed output. The fall in commodities prices has hit other oil producers, too, such as Angola and Ghana, while Zambia, the continent\u2019s second-biggest copper producer, has suffered as copper prices have plunged to a six-year low.\u201d Nigeria has to smell the coffee. We must come to terms with the fact that the 2016 budget proposals is a great goof that betrays lack of appreciation of the need to CHANGE our ways. A return to the drawing board is necessary. We must urgently disperse powers to the federating units so they can start in earnest the exploration of non-oil minerals under their soil and create new corridors of prosperity. There is too much resources in Abuja with little responsibility which is the reason scandalous spendings would continue to be its lot. To continue to do what brought us to where we are and call it CHANGE is sheer deception. Give us the real change now! Related",

        "author": "Muhammed Adamu",
        "text": "By Muhammed Adamu Biafra and the secessionist right of a minority revisited AND although the American Constitution, as Abraham Lincoln posited \u201ccontained no prohibition of secession or enforcement language to preserve the Union\u201d, it did \u2013like all other democratic constitutions- specify an oath of office mandating the President \u201cto preserve, protect and defend the Constitution\u201d. And if so, what can be more deserving of the President\u2019s \u2018preservation\u2019, \u2018protection\u2019 and \u2018defense\u2019 -in a constitutional democracy- than the territorial integrity of the State? And thus said experts that in the true interpretation of \u2018sovereign power\u2019, \u201csince the people had not vested the President with the authority to fix the terms of separation\u201d, Lincoln was right to make \u201cwar the inevitable consequence of secession\u201d and to declare himself \u201cconstitutionally unable to stop it\u201d. And as Lincoln himself eloquently said, whereas the secessionists had \u201cno oath registered in heaven to destroy\u201d the union, he as President had \u201cthe most solemn one to \u2018preserve\u2019, \u2018protect\u2019 and \u2018defend it\u2019.\u201d Lincoln said whenever \u201cthe people grow weary of the existing government, they can exercise their constitutional right of amending it or their revolutionary right to dismember or overthrow it.\u201d The phrase \u2018the people\u2019 without doubt refers to the \u2018majority\u2019 not a \u2018minority\u2019 of it. A minority can only hope to court the cooperation of the \u2018majority\u2019 peacefully to secede. Hypothetical scenario But since according to Lincoln, \u201cUnanimity\u201d on the one hand \u201cis impossible\u201d and \u201cthe rule of a minority\u201d \u201cis wholly inadmissible\u201d, anarchy or despotism \u2013he warned- would be \u201call that is left\u201d if the rule of a \u2018democratic majority\u2019 was rejected. Said he, even in the hypothetical scenario that the U.S. were \u2018not a government proper\u2019 but merely an association of states in the nature of \u2018contract\u2019, that contract could not be \u201cpeaceably unmade by less than all the parties who made it\u201d; because, whereas \u201cOne party to a contract may violate (or)\u2026 break it, does it not require\u201d he asked \u201call, to lawfully rescind it?\u201d The right of the Igbo \u2018minority\u2019 or any other \u2018minority\u2019 for that matter, to secede from a constitutionally governed Nigeria must be located in the complex hyacinth of these jurisprudential argument. And in all honesty it is a right concurrent with \u2013if not inferior to- the right of the democratic \u2018majority\u2019 to deny. Still on Buhari\u2019s appointments: Those who once strained logic to disprove the \u2018good\u2019 inherent in the equitable principle of zoning\u2019, were the same \u2018pious priests\u2019 of \u2018geo-ethnic balance\u2019 who vilified Buhari for not applying \u2018federal character\u2019 even in the appointment of his \u2018personal\u2019 presidential aides. But you dared not to remind them that Jonathan had in fact only one northerner of note \u2013namely his Principal Secretary- on the entire team of his own \u2018presidential aides\u2019. You are the ethnic bigot who dares to bring this up and not \u2018they\u2019 who choose selectively to moralise about it. Jonathan\u2019s team of presidential aides was virtually an \u2018all-South-South\u2019 list mostly of his Ijaw kinsmen with some gratuitous sprinkling perhaps of a few south easterners many of whom now feel obligated to play the vengeful mourners-in-chief of his lost bid for a second term. The justice we must seek should be the \u2018equitable\u2019 distribution of national resources and not necessarily the \u2018equal\u2019 appointment of those who distribute the resources. By the way what does it matter if ethnic groups are \u2018equally\u2019 represented in appointments but do not get an \u2018equitable\u2019 share of the common resource? Or what does it matter if they are \u2018un-equally\u2019 represented but are \u2018equitably\u2019 provided for from the common resource? In any case, if we are to distribute appointments \u2018equally\u2019 instead of sharing resources \u2018equitably\u2019, how do we go about it? By regions? Why not by zones? -to achieve balance. By states? Why not by LGs? -to achieve spread. By ethnic groups? Why not by tribes? -to create a sense of belonging! Why don\u2019t we do it by household? -to achieve the utopia of \u2018EQUALITY\u2019 we always wanted! The Trump-Hillary Conundrum: For the Americans, there is not the luxury even of settling for that proverbial \u2018lesser evil\u2019 -because in reality each of the two \u2018evils\u2019 is equally as fiendish. In fact, there is no better example of the universal un-redeeming power of \u2018democracy\u2019 than the \u2018no-choice\u2019\u2026between Trump and Hillary what we have competing for votes are NOT the personifications of \u2018republican\u2019 or \u2018democratic\u2019 ideals. Nor are Americans having to choose between \u2018good\u2019 and \u2018bad\u2019 candidate, because no matter how the world is divided over Trump and Hillary, we are unanimous on one thing, namely that both of them are debouched \u2013morally and otherwise\u2026. And between the \u2018Trump-said\u2019 or \u2018Hillary-said\u2019, the one thing that is left un-said is that both of them cannot wait to get their hands on America\u2019s instruments of offense -to harm the world\u2026 Notwithstanding who wins between Trump and Hillary, the \u2018right\u2019 of \u2018might\u2019 in international politics will continue to take precedence over both \u2018legal\u2019 and \u2018moral\u2019 imperatives. America will continue to keep no \u2018permanent friends\u2019 or \u2018permanent enemies\u2019; but she will be more determined even to assert the \u2018permanence\u2019 only of her \u2018interests\u2019. Whoever emerges U.S. President, will continue to ride roughshod over both the written and the unwritten rules of international law. June 12\u2019s Enemy Judges: Justice Mustapha, like the late Justice Bassey Ikpeme \u2013who granted the dead-at-night judgment leading to the annulment of June 12- was one of those hand-in-glove with the Abacha junta in its desperate efforts to bury the ghost of June 12 by keeping its acclaimed winner under judicial lock and key\u2026 not a few unconscionable politicians, lawyers and judges were prostrate at the foothill of Abacha jackboots offering advice on how to tame the genie of June 12 to create an imperial presidency for Abacha. Inglorious politician In retrospect IBB, to secure the trust of Nigerians in his rather unending Transition Programme had promulgated a Decree ousting the jurisdiction of courts in any suit seeking to stop the 1993 presidential election. In fact his second in Command the late Admiral Aikhomu made a habit of bragging about the regime\u2019s fidelity to its Transition promise and citing this decree as proof thereof. But behind the scenes the government was working with an inglorious politician, Arthur Nzeribe under the dubious \u2018Association for Better Nigeria\u2019 first to de-campaign the election and eventually to use the courts to abort the process. Justice Mustapha must have been carefully selected too as the first trial judge who in the course of a long, tortuous trial neither hid his aversion for June 12 nor his readiness to compromise the judicial process in the service of the military junta in power\u2026. Justice Ikpeme granted an order, in disregard of an outer decree \u2013 which she should not have- stopping the conduct of the June 12 election; the electoral Chief Humphrey Nwosu rightly disregarded that order and conducted the election; Justice Saleh granted an order \u2013which like Ikpeme\u2019s, was in breach of the ouster decree- stopping further announcement of the election results; the same Saleh followed with another order declaring the election \u2018null and void\u2019 \u2013in disregard of the Electoral Commission\u2019s pending appeal against Justice Ikpeme\u2019s first injunction. And then Babangida, relying on Justice Saleh\u2019s last declaration, announced that the election stood annulled! Troubled economies Even the world\u2019s acclaimed quintessence of the \u2018free market\u2019, -the American \u2018economy\u2019-, is not entirely immune to the vagaries of the voodoos of capitalism. And so it has always been for every capitalist economy; so much that it can safely be said that \u2018periodic slump\u2019 is the veritable hallmark of any \u2018free market\u2019 economy. Economists often warn that whenever an \u2018economy\u2019 beats all odds to \u2018bubble and bubble\u2019, watch out soon for the \u2018burst\u2019! Meaning that no matter how well run, capitalist economies essentially are prone to \u2018boom and bloom\u2019 even as they are inexplicably susceptible to sudden \u2018doom and gloom\u2019\u2026 Even with the cleanest \u2018bill of health\u2019, any capitalist economy can sooner be in Intensive Care, than a man with a \u2018heart attack\u2019\u2026. Man has deliberately created a Frankenstein system of capitalistic economy and to whose unpredictable monstrosity even he, has become a perpetual victim. But this \u2018unpredictable monstrosity\u2019 he calls \u2018market forces\u2019 rather that what it truly is, \u2018forcing the market\u2019. \u2018Market forces\u2019 are the soulless factors that reward \u2018opportunism\u2019 and often punish \u2018industry\u2019. Yet, they are celebrated today as the defining criteria for \u2018free trade\u2019. \u2018Free trade\u2019 is NOT \u2018free\u2019. The irony is redolent with the tease of William Keagan, in \u2018The Specter of Capitalism\u2019 where even as he insists \u201cCommunism has failed\u201d, he also admits that \u201ccapitalism has not succeeded.\u201d Paddings, proposals and approvals: A budget is not padded merely because the legislature, following due legislative process, and for reasons mutually appreciated by parliament and the executive, has moved monies from one subhead to another; nor is a budget padded merely because parliament -following due legislative process- and for reasons of even-spread (duly communicated to the executive), has moved proposed projects from one location to another. A budget is not padded where parliament, for good reasons (mutually appreciated by it and the executive), steps down projects from the budget. In fact, a budget is not padded merely because one member of parliament out-lobbies other members to attract \u2013within the bounds of legislative norms- more projects to his constituency than others to his constituency where others fail to. But a budget is padded \u2013notwithstanding due legislative process has been followed- where parliament unilaterally increases the overall budget sum as proposed by the President who alone knows the capacities and limits of the executive in raising those revenues. Thus, the saying that \u2018parliament may \u2018reduce\u2019 but cannot \u2018increase\u2019 the budget\u2019 because it is not privy to the \u2018ways and means\u2019 of the executive. A budget is padded where parliament \u2013in spite of the due legislative process- unilaterally, imports into it entirely new projects, and it is immaterial that the legislature merely substitutes proposed projects with new. A budget is padded if a member, or any group of chambers exploiting the privilege of their positions, connive(s) with any agency of the Executive to over-allocate funds to particular projects with the intention thereafter that any one or all of the conniving parties benefit from that superfluity. Tactical retreat And a budget is padded if after passage by both chambers and before or after harmonisation any member(s) import(s) into the budget new subheads or juggle(s) existing ones for the benefit of their constituencies and without the knowledge of other members. OBJ: The NASS He knows: It was the barefaced insistence \u2013for selfish motives- by both chambers of the NASS to execute capital projects side by side with the supposedly arduous task of lawmaking, that prematurely sung the Nunc Dimittis of the Chuba Okadigbo Senate Presidency. He and several other senators and members of the House were indicted by the \u2018Senator Idris Kuta Probe Report\u2019 for fraud in the execution of several NASS Complex contract projects which they had awarded to themselves. But the indication that removing Chuba was merely a tactical retreat -to assuage public opinion- and not a surrender, was that the Senate thereafter decided, at one of their usual conspiratorial executive sessions, to dump the Kuta Report by passing a mock-heroic resolution pardoning all indicted members\u2026 Thus the claim recently by the Saraki Senate that all crimes and misdemeanors of a legislative kind are essentially the internal affairs of the Senate and not subject to the investigative powers of the police or the prosecutorial rights of the AGF, is a mindset traceable to the permissive precedent already set by the Senate on the Kuta Report. \u2018NASS: THE OUTLAW AS LAWMAKER\u2019 We are stuck today with a Constitution that has not only placed \u2018unlimited power\u2019 in an arrogant and greedy legislature, but one too which has unwittingly provided ineffectual checks on such cantankerous arm of government. In 17 years, we have already grown a monstrous legislature peopled mostly by egotistic, despotic and selfish lawmakers who, contrary even to the \u2018doctrine of the rule of law\u2019 feel no qualms legislating for their own personal aggrandizement. If our legislators are not busy \u2018abrogating\u2019 electoral laws to pave a way for their political interests, they are desperately attempting to \u2018amend\u2019 the criminal code to escape justice or the Constitution, to acquire immunity against the scrutiny of the other arms of government. Our lawmakers have attempted in the past even to make laws ousting courts\u2019 jurisdiction; they have defied the orders of court; they have declared the Auditor General of the Federation incapable of looking into their accounts. And now the Saraki Assembly is telling us that the criminal conspiracy to forge the Standing Rules of the Senate is merely the \u2018internal affairs\u2019 of the Senate \u2026.Nigerians are virtually resigned to the belief that they are always stuck with assemblies that are unworthy of the moral high ground on which they place them. And now we are virtually hoisted in the petard of a constitutional conundrum. Those who should amend our defective Constitution to correct anomaly are the ones drunk with the nectar of its superfluity and are therefore unlikely to legislate to abrogate the pleasure.

        "text": "By Muhammed Adamu \u2018A Clash of three powers\u2019(09/03/16) TO suggest that the Attorney General instituting criminal proceedings against the Senate leadership bears the imprimatur of the Executive arm undermining the principles of separation of powers, or that it constitutes a coup of one arm against another, is most uncharitable, to say the least\u2026. The theoretical notion of the \u2018independence\u2019 of the arms of government is a misnomer. What exists in practice is functional \u2018inter-dependence\u2019. Thus, the idea of non-interference in the affairs of one arm by another practically is a farce. Each arm in one way or another is constitutionally obligated to interfere in the affairs of the other. Resolving crime cannot be the internal affairs of the legislature. It is the prerogative of the executive to prosecute those accused of committing crime, and it is the duty of the judiciary to determine their guilt or innocence. Legislators cannot hide under the guise of lawmaking to get away with high crimes and misdemeanors. \u2018Still on the sick economy\u2019 (05/09/16) We managed to \u2018swim\u2019 under Obasanjo. We paddled hard to stay \u2018afloat\u2019 under Yar\u2019 Adua. But under Jonathan, the ship of State had gathered so much moss it was already \u2018drowning\u2019. We had virtually slipped off the cliff already and could not have landed in one piece without a shattered carapace. And now putting our broken pieces together so we can move on cannot be without some pain! There will be pain when the doctors apply the methylated spirit; there will be more pain even when they lay their knives and pincers. Wastes and leakages Yet, growth for us is that we have not only transited from a profligate Jonathan to a prudent Buhari, we have virtually put a stop to humongous theft, mismanagement, waste and leakages in the administration of the Commonwealth. Growth to us is we are on the path of \u2018regeneration\u2019 \u2013no matter how slowly so- and no longer in the throes of rot and decay. Growth for us is that our pain comes from the healing hands of a physician we can trust and not from the cursed fangs of a rabid canine that afflicted us all! \u2018Ali: A Tribute\u2019 (09/12/16) Although Ali graduated from college at the bottom of his class and had difficulty with the \u2018printed word\u2019, he had shaped up to be a \u2018bad-ass\u2019 wordsmith in a class entirely by himself. He had spun such excellent poetic barbs in assail or rebuttal of opponents as had made poets blush. He would say: \u201cI\u2019ll beat him in EIGHT to prove that I am GREAT, and if he wants to go to HEAVEN I\u2019ll take him in SEVEN; but if he keeps talking JAAZ, I\u2019ll cut it to FIVE\u201d. Ali was such a man of oratorical sleigh of \u2018mouth\u2019 that he gave instant witty retorts even to the most spontaneous turns of event. When his managers worried about a particular \u2018ring size\u2019 not being of regulated standard, Ali retorted: \u201cI don\u2019t care how small the ring is, I\u2019ll fight that chum in a telephone booth!\u201d In the segregated childhood days of Ali, there were two Americas: white and black; but by the time the curtains dropped for this greatest of all greats, America was one sending forth this illustrious son of the world, Muhammad Ali. \u2018Ode to MKO: A Parody of Shakespeare\u2019 (06/20/16) On the 12th day of June, a mandate was given; by the \u2018many\u2019 to one worthy of the peoples\u2019 trust. He was a \u2018man of the people\u2019; he was the \u2018peoples\u2019 man\u2019 -the great MKO, my Principal\u2026. But the \u2018freest\u2019 and \u2018fairest\u2019 election, soon was cowardly annulled; and the mandate holder cruelly put to jail. And as though that was not enough , on the 8th day of July after years in their gilded gaol, the great MKO was felled at last\u2026 Soon the army of exigency became marauders of mischief; avoiding remembrance of \u2018June 12\u2019 or the 8th of July. They came up with a barren \u2018May 29\u2019 which they say is \u2018Democracy Day\u2019. Meaning that between the \u2018fig\u2019, the \u2018olive\u2019 and the tree of \u2018vine\u2019, they chose the accursed tree of Jesus that bore no fruits. And the question again is asked: What hath this day deserved? What hath it done that it, in golden letters should be set among the high tides in the calendar? If the tree may be known by the fruit, as the fruit by the tree, June 12 is our \u2018Democracy Day\u2019. \u2018Tinubu\u2019s right of first refusal\u2019 (10/05/16) On contribution to the APC, Tinubu alone stands in a class all by himself. Many were neither there during the delicate pre-natal challenges of the formation of the APC nor at the trying ante-natal stages of uncertain expectation. They were hardly there during the excruciating pangs of the labour that occasioned the birth of APC. Tinubu was not just the revolution\u2019s first rag-tag foot soldier, but the lone actor who laid both the geo-political and ideological infrastructure for the expression of the \u2018idea\u2019 that gave birth to the revolution. Whereas his 8-years as Governor provided the ideological basis for a renaissance of progressive-governance, his one-man-army\u2019s legal battle against the reactionary forces of electoral gerrymandering to re-claim the South West, provided the geo-political launch-pad required for a pan-Nigerian initiative to liberate the country\u2026. \u2018Musdapher: The Voice not heeded\u2019 (10/19/16) Although time was at a premium for his barely eleven-month tenure as CJN, Justice Musdapher was the first to embark on a holistic judicial reform programme involving \u2013for the first time- a no-holds-barred public expos\u00e9 of the rot in the Nigerian Judiciary \u2026 Moribund procedures He was the first Chief Justice not to follow the sedate, publicity-shy style of his predecessors. He was not about to keep quiet and sanctify the aura of judicial secrecy that had always shrouded the operations of the judicial system. He succeeded in getting the message across that the legal system is dogged no less by deficient laws and moribund procedures, than by corrupt judges and lawyers in the Temple of Justice. And even as he warned that the inability of the Judiciary to provide remedy to the growing menace of cut-throat politics, was becoming worrisome, Musdapher also lamented \u201cthe gradual but steady flight of decorum, ethics and rules of professional conduct\u201d from the Bench and the Bar. \u2018The Texture of Justice\u2019 (10/26/16) Such was the greatness and practical sense of juristic propriety of British judges, and such was the texture of justice, that Denning, in a feat of patriotic bravado said if \u201ca future Prime Minister should seek to pack the Bench with judges of his own extreme colour\u201d, British citizens would \u201cneed have no fear\u201d, that such judges would be tools in the hands of political authority; because the judges of England \u201chave always \u2013and always will- be vigilant in guarding our freedoms\u201d\u2026.The idea that the \u2018hands\u2019 of a judge are \u2018tied\u2019 by \u2018unjust provisions\u2019 so that he can only rule in a manner that does not achieve \u2018justice\u2019 is lame, escapist and untenable. The powers of a judge to decide what the law \u2018is\u2019 or what it ought to be, knows no bounds. If the \u2018law\u2019 contains impurities not conducive to the attainment of justice, it behooves a judge not to surrender to those impurities but to \u2018construct\u2019 the law to work justice\u2026. Thus said Denning, although a \u201cJudge must not alter the material of which (the law) is woven\u201d, yet \u201che can and should iron out the creases\u201d. \u2018NASS and the Buhari Initiative\u2019 (11/07/16) A President must take the lead role in executive-legislature relations. He must always be a notch ahead of his constitutional check-mates. How he does this is less a matter of theory than it is of expediency. And whereas a jackbooted approach would be practically unsustainable, passive non-interference \u2013which Buhari seems to favour- can be terribly self-harming! Rather than portray the President as respectful of democratic limits, it betrays a feeble presidential initiative and by implication a weak presidency. Meddlesomeness and non-interference It is in tactfully striking a delicate balance between the extremes of meddlesomeness and non-interference that \u2018strong presidents\u2019 live up to their Executive billings. The APC lost the momentum when \u2013no thanks to Mr. President\u2019s ill-advised aloofness- it failed to corral its newly elected legislators to speak with one voice and to install party-centrist leaderships in both chambers. Since then virtually every internal crises of the APC owes its origin to that presidential indiscretion. \u2018Now that Trump is president\u2019 (11/16/16) Now the fault lines in the American Presidential system of democracy are beginning to show signs of fatigue, the import of the fallacy of the \u2018electoral college\u2019 is made more poignant today than any theoretical study could expose. Truth is: even when the founding fathers were shaping the union, there was no plan that the \u2018people\u2019 should be trusted to be their own \u2018sovereigns\u2019 -their right to \u2018directly\u2019 elect their president ceded to a manipulable elite club \u2013the \u2018electoral college\u2019. Many delegates to the Conference did not believe that an \u2018ignorant\u2019 majority should be trusted with the task of directly electing the President. In fact, Virginia\u2019s delegate, George Mason said to allow that was tantamount to \u201creferring a trial of colours to a blind man\u201d. The \u2018electoral college\u2019 is not a product of superior wisdom, but a hurriedly-debated middle ground to calm feuding delegates torn between choosing \u2018Congress\u2019 or the \u2018people\u2019 as direct electors of the President. \u2018Niger: My poor Orphaned state\u2019 (11/23/16) In the 16 years that PDP despoiled my State, Niger, I have written many titles either importuning good governance, or in moments of personal outrage, reprimanding the lack of it. Once, Gov. Aliyu in his typical do-nothing \u2018stunt\u2019, arranged to be physically launched on Zuma Rock to titillate his ego and to amuse hangers-on. This non-event was basis for governance discourse with himself as star actor who had done what Napoleon could not do. Ironically right beneath the Rock was a 30-year-old uncompleted and abandoned State-owned 5-star hotel. Aliyu the star-Rock-climber took the shine off this derelict metaphor of waste and shame. But it was to the \u2018heroics\u2019 of another do-nothing Governor, Kure that removed \u2018Zuma Rock\u2019 from the 5-naira note on the grounds that the Federal government\u2019s use of it violated landmark rights. Since then apart from the historic landing of Aliyu on it, we have done nothing to exploit the tourist potentials of this Rock except lend its use to the Police on their crime patrol vehicles. \u2018Still on Obasanjo\u2019 (11/30/16) Love him or loath him, you know where Obasanjo stands; from the \u2018serious\u2019 to the \u2018ludicrous\u2019; from the \u2018sacred\u2019 to the \u2018profane\u2019. He is neither covetous of your applause nor timorous of your disapproval. His \u2018eccentricity\u2019 is neither acted to enchant his friends nor is it staged to beguile his enemies. He is indomitably expressive in a manner that titillates his friends and taunts his enemies\u2026 Obasanjo has proved a man of such consistent self-evagination that much as you can predict, he\u2019ll not disappoint the pleasant expectation of his fans, you know he\u2019ll not fail the repugnant anticipation of his enemies. Repugnant anticipation And with a bit of ironic flavor, his conduct that provokes revulsion in some, in others evokes admiration.. The Obasanjo genie, like an octopus in the deep, never ceases to unravel itself. It beguiles both the time and the surrounding. When you think he is just a \u2018smoking gun\u2019 or a gun waiting to smoke, beware, he may be the \u2018bullet in the chamber\u2019 raring to go; when you think he is the trigger to be pulled, he may be the itchy finger ready to pull. \u2018Now that everyone is a Journalist\u2019 (12/14/16) There is something wrong with the media \u2013especially in our own part of the world where the judiciary is hardly at hand, or rarely approached, to aid those whose privacy is daily invaded or whose reputations are frequently violated. And we must ask the questions; \u2018is what is wrong with the society equally what is wrong with the press? Or is what is wrong with the press equally what is wrong with the society? Does the media take its freedom as an opportunity for self discipline in the sense of \u2018voluntarily assuming responsibility\u2019, or as an opportunity to give \u201cthe public too much froth \u2013simply because- too few want substance?\u201d If too few members of the public want substance, do we have a civic duty as journalists to elevate the taste of the public away from \u2018froth\u2019 or do we have the professional liberty to exploit the public\u2019s poor taste by denying it \u2018substance\u2019? \u2018BUHARI, BIGOTS AND THE ANTI-CORRUPTION WAR\u2019 (12/21/16) The \u2018do-nothing\u2019 advocates on corruption say that unless Buhari is able to net corrupt persons all at once, he has not the moral right to net any corrupt person at all. That if he cannot catch them all, he must let all be: \u2018do not arrest anybody, unless you can arrest everybody\u2019. Or put this way: \u2018unless you can arrest everybody, you must not arrest anybody\u2019. Which is as dumb as saying: unless you can arrest all armed robbers, you must not arrest any armed robber. By the way, since they have also said that virtually \u2018everybody\u2019 except Buhari is corrupt, maybe what they are advocating is a \u2018government-by-one puritan, for all\u2019. Or if \u2013as others insist- Buhari himself is corrupt, maybe then they are advocating for an \u2018auto-piloted government\u2019! Isn\u2019t that wonderful? A nation of sinners with a hypocritical mind for the puritanical. They will neither be governed by any with a chink on his moral armor, nor by one with a blot on his moral escutcheon! Related",

        "title": "2016 Olympics: Team Nigeria, Failure Foretold",
        "author": "Dr. Ugoji Ebgujo",
        "text": "By Dr. Ugoji Ebgujo Jamaica. Bahamas. What happened to us? We became rich, and foolish? Before our athletes started running for inconsequential countries like Qatar, our teams at international meets had started having more officials than competitors. We once dominated the sprints and gunned for boxing medals. Now, we are in Brazil with one real sprinter , and only one boxer. Prayers are good. Nigeria\u2019s Rio Olympic team training at the soccer training ground of the Georgia State University in USA. But our Caribbean cousins are not prayer warriors. That which has left us with only one boxer at the 2016 games indeed calls for prayers. The idea of Konyegwachie and Izonritei cannot contemplate such wretchedness. Dick Tiger is now so mythical. But the Dream Team 6\u2019s Atlanta nightmare can explain the tragedy. Before Delta Airline produced adverts that speak of their efficiency in rescuing persons lost at the sea of planlessness, our sports minister had gone to inspect facilities in Brazil. If the idea was to see how the Olympics is organized first hand then it could yet be a prudent trip. There is no harm in thinking futuristically. But while he was inspecting facilities thousands of miles away, his athletes were loitering in disillusionment. They were trapped in an acute reality the frivolity and superficiality of a ministerial sightseeing of Brazilian facilities could not postpone. When the dream team took their dreams beyond the incompetence of the sports ministry and the NOC, the minister wringed his hands off their apparent truancy. It was enough to say, the nation was broke and all training programmes should happen locally. He had gone to check for them where they would lodge in Brazil, and they should be contented. When filth started seeping out, and ineptitude started confronting our every gaze, we were told to disregard the gossip of fools. Nigerians never lack enemies. And they see them in criticisms and failures as they see them in illnesses. It wasn\u2019t long before the stranded football team made international news headlines. And the shame splashed on everyone. The minister bolted out of his woolgathering and started oozing incoherent excuses. Few hours to our first game, it felt like a bad dream. Only dreams blend paralysis and anxious haste so well to yield such intolerable torment. And we started praying. Our team had months, but now needed a miracle to get to the pitch. We provided comic relief to a world then wracked by terrorist attacks. Delta, answered our prayers. We got the attention of pity that Europe bound refugees, rescued from hopelessness at sea, have made their own. Once the team began defying the odds, in a style typically Nigerian, government officials started sidling towards the once abandoned players with effusive praises. Their success had to be owned. The minister now became proud of them. The other athletes met the perfidy with loud murmurs. The legendary neglect of preparation and welfare of the athletes should curtail the exuberance of fist pumps. This government is not the reason we have only one boxer at the games. Our decay has been chronic and institutional. Our priorities have been our worst enemy. The Olympic village at Afuze, Edo state, has been allowed to decay. But strangely, and more tellingly, we couldn\u2019t even muster that last minute self deception in hurried late preparations. 2016 is a new low. It shouldn\u2019t be the ministry but the NOC and the federations are technically moribund. Government still funds sports. The Dream Team won gold twenty years ago. This regression in administration is scandalous. Long Jump is now as strange as Rowing. But Rowing has reiterated the lesson Judo tried to teach. A self sponsored Nigerian girl, who could as well have claimed the North Pole as her nationality, competed for Nigeria in Rowing,in Brazil. She has proved, like Chukwumerije before her, that abject planning rather than talent has consumed our medals. Rowers and swimmers and weightlifters abound in us. When some athletes took their frustration to social media and solicited for air tickets to Brazil, they were hushed. That was the culmination of the wretchedness of an Olympic preparation. Cold blanket was thrown , all was smothered. But sitting customarily beside this misery is the perennial story of the waywardness of funds released for these games. While accountability and probity can be the starting point of a revival, our sports needs brighter ideas. While we must sort out the age-cheating that hinders youngsters and makes European clubs discount our players, we must salvage our local league. And while the league needs innovation to get the crowds back, the corruption that lets referees sell matches must end. The reticence of corporate bodies can\u2019t be broken until pimps stop running games. If we immortalize sports heroes, then we can channel youthful ambitions. And reorder societal priorities away from mercantilism while building national pride. But after the shabbiness that was the official participation in Keshi\u2019s funeral, one or two athletes may again opt for Portugal. If the future is in agriculture, it is because the resources abound. Good sports development programme that starts from the schools will be as redemptive as any \u2018back to the farms\u2019 programme. But if the lawn tennis courts in our national stadia are being sustained by alms, then we must be afflicted by a terrible effort-desire mismatch. It is the denial of this stark discrepancy that always leaves us with shattered hopes. Tragically , we are getting accustomed to being mere cheerleaders for the Jamaicans. If square pegs are incessantly plugged into round holes at the very top, then our predicament truly needs the most fervent of prayers . Our sportsmen think our failures are self inflicted. The sports ministerial portfolio cannot be another token that can go to just about anybody. Because when ignorance and incompetence come together in a minister destitute of passion for sports, misery is magnified. If sports is a resource that must now be tapped, then the prioritization of expertise and passion will be a good starting point. The organized private sector\u2019s participation will be indispensable in driving a regeneration. It can\u2019t be enticed by chaos and arbitrariness. A comprehensive development plan that unites corporate world funding with grassroots participation will save our sports.2020 is at the door. Related",

        "title": "2016: Year of inconclusiveness",
        "author": "Josef Omorotionmwan",
        "text": "By Josef Omorotionmwan THE outgoing year 2016 has been unique in several ways. It was principally the year of inconclusive elections; when re-run polls brought forward from the previous year could not be concluded in single shots. The harder they tried, the more the elections became hanging. Till date, the major combatants in Rivers State are still within shooting range and some of the legislative elections are still yearning for final determination. The war is raging and souls are perishing. 2016 was also the year of monumental trials, SANs convictions. After trials come judgments. This explains our fear that all the convictions will arrive in 2017. It also goes down as the year of profound duplicity, where there was an avalanche of plurality of reports. Suddenly, there was what appeared to be the cloning of the year\u2019s budget. At a point, prayer sessions were held in churches and mosques while officials had to swear to affidavits as to which of the various versions in circulation was the one submitted by the Executive. Flowing directly from the above, the phrase, \u201cBudget padding\u201d entered into our political lexicon for the first time. We have travelled this route before. In the Second Republic, during the consideration of the Electoral Bill, 1982, Prof. Ayodele Awojobi, a Professor of Mechanical Engineering at the University of Lagos, suddenly addressed a world press conference that he had stumbled into four different versions of the Electoral Act, 1982. It was later discovered that the Draft Bill submitted to the National Assembly by the Executive was one Electoral Act; the version considered by the Senate was a second Electoral Act; the Bill as processed by the House of Representatives was his third Electoral Act; and the Bill that was reported out of the Conference Committee of both Houses, which was finally assented to by the President was the fourth version of Awojobi\u2019s Electoral Act. This past week, two separate reports emanated from the Department of State Security, DSS, during the confirmation hearing of Ibrahim Magu for the position of Chairman, Economic and Financial Crimes Commission, EFCC. Both reports were signed on the same day and by the same schedule officer. One was sent to the Acting Clerk of the Senate, Mohammed Sani-Omolori while the other was sent to the Senior Special Assistant to the President on National Assembly Matters, Senator Ita Enang. While the former was totally damaging and gave Magu no chance of being confirmed; the latter recommended him for confirmation. What an irony! In this piece, we shall attempt to examine the possible implication of the 2016 theatricals for Year 2017 and the future of this country. Without prejudice to the outcome of the ongoing Electoral Reform Committee, it is clear that the Independent National Electoral Commission, INEC, must work extra-hard to remove itself from the inconclusive elections syndrome. As 2019 is around the corner, the current INEC must work twice as hard as its predecessor to be half as good. It bears repeating here that the Professor Jega-led INEC only attained acceptability after several years of fumbling; and we are sure that Nigerians cannot afford the luxury of further apprenticeship. For them, Jega has left a standard, below which no one should go. Year 2017 promises to provide a litmus test of our serious-mindedness. It is to be seen whether we can bark and bite or whether we shall continue to be the toothless bull-dog. Whichever way it goes, there are challenges ahead. If we were really serious and equally massive convictions come in 2017, there will be disaster culminating perhaps in institutional collapses. Assume for a while that the Senate President gets thrown into prison. The Senate will automatically collapse as those Senators who migrated to the court during his trial will, on their honour, also follow him to prison. We know a particular political party that will go into liquidation if the 2016 trials result in high conviction rates. Right now, most of our courts are short of judges and many of the few remaining judges are prison-bound, particularly those involving the midnight raids and high-profile trails, thus our judiciary may also be heading for imminent extinction. On the other hand, a low conviction rate on those monumental trials of 2016 will be worse. That will raise many fundamental questions: for instance, for how long shall we remain at the infantile level of using our institutions to address personal and individual differences and for political vendetta? And how do we expect our institutions to ever grow? Barely a year ago, Ibrahim Lamorde, then Chairman of the EFCC was holding Mrs. Toyin Saraki, wife of the Senate President at the jugular over alleged stupendous wealth accumulation when her husband was the Governor of Kwara State. Senator Godswill Akpabio was also being vigorously investigated over allegation of massive corruption while he was the Governor of Akwa Ibom State. Suddenly, Lamorde was pushed out of the anti-graft agency and the cases died. Ibrahim Magu replaced him in acting capacity. Today, Magu cannot get a Senate confirmation, not because he has been found wanting on performance but because he has stepped on a few big toes in the process of performing well. Meanwhile the very corrupt in society are now the ones wheeling and dealing and trading-off their iniquities in the ensuing confusion. People must refrain from doing the same old things for which the PDP was shown the door at the last general elections. The chosen war on corruption must be firmly prosecuted, devoid of political colouration. Far into the 21st century Nigeria is still dealing at the basic primitive level of the survival of the fittest as exists in the animal kingdom, which Charles Darwin (1809-1882) dealt extensively with in his Theory of Evolution. Even in all this, the clock never stops ticking. In less than 72 hours, we shall be stepping into 2017 \u2013 the year of expected answers to numerous questions! We wish our esteemed audience the very best. Related",

        "author": "None",
        "text": "The 2018 Appropriation bill will be laid before the National Assembly by President Muhammadu Buhari on Tuesday 7th November 2017. However, the above title, which was published in December 2016, was this writers\u2019 overview of the proposed 2017 budget. Please read on. \u201cA fiscal plan is usually a clear and precise statement of what government hopes to realistically earn as income and how much it would spend within a given time frame; invariably, where projected expenditure exceeds actual income, the shortfall will invariably be funded with loans or savings. President Muhammadu Buhari (M) presents the 2017 National Budget to a joint session of the National Assembly at the National Assembly Complex in Abuja on Wednesday. Regrettably, Nigeria\u2019s fiscal plans, despite years of bountiful oil revenue, were predicated on increasing deficits, usually funded by borrowing, with inappropriately high interest rates. The 2016 budget is sadly the same, as about N2Tn (over 35%) was allocated to debt service from the projected total spending of N6.06Tn; regrettably, until lately, the Legislature had never publicly expressed concern on such oppressive debt service charges. Sadly, however, although Budget Minister, Udo Udoma, recently reported \u201ca 79% performance ratio of the pro-rated budget for January-September 2016\u201d, there is clearly, so far, no respite from the social anguish in, an economy in distress, and indications are, that it could get worse in 2017. The failure of Budget 2016 to reverse the economic downturn was probably foretold by the wide disconnect between the promises of a better life and the actual reality of dashed hopes from preceding fiscal plans, which were unfortunately also heralded as panacea to our economic downturn. Similar speculation also preceded passage of the 2016 budget; sadly, however, soon after budget enactment, the economy went instead, into a tail spin, clearly against government\u2019s earlier hype of redemption. Although, the writing was clearly on the wall, authors of budget 2016 obviously could not foresee the looming spectre of massive Naira devaluation and over 50% increase in petrol price. Unfortunately, the 2017 budget process seems destined to follow the same path that has previously yielded negative socioeconomic returns. Regrettably, 2017 budget has been placed before the National Assembly, probably less than 2 weeks, before the usually extended Year end Parliamentary recess. Consequently, if the Legislature steadfastly commits to a thorough evaluation to achieve consensus, with the Executive blueprint, enactment of the 2017 budget may probably not happen before April 2017. However, if the legislature simply flips through the budget statement, in an expression of e spirit d\u00e9 corp with Mr. President, the 2017 budget will most probably also fail to fulfill public expectation. It may be suggested, however, that legislative approval, will be timely, since the 2016-19 Medium Term Expenditure Framework (MTEF), on which the 2017 budget was predicated, was presented to NASS since 30th September 2016. Although, after the initial vociferous calls to return the document to Mr. President to provide supplementary details to the proposals, the Senate eventually soft pedalled and subsequently agreed to appraise the MTEF document. Nonetheless, Senate Leader, Ali Ndume described the document as \u201ccompletely empty\u201d and also noted that \u201cyou cannot build something on nothing\u201d. Furthermore, according to Ndume, the Budget Minister had also failed, to respond to the Senate\u2019s request for \u201ca comprehensive report on 2016 budget implementation. The Senator leader, was also concerned that relevant information have not yet been provided for the \u201cfiscal rates, taxes, charges, etc from which the projected N6.80Tn 2017 revenue was derived\u201d. Finally, debt issue, Ndume also demanded a report on the \u201cstructure of debt composition, sources of funds and how borrowed funds are to be spent, as well as a reasonable repayment plan and schedule for national debts\u201d. Similarly, while commenting on the MTEF, Senate Spokesperson, Senator Abdullahi wondered \u201cif the Federal Executive is not padded with people who want to frustrate the government\u201d. Ultimately, however, the consensus across party divide in the senate was that the critical assumptions predicating the 2016-19 MTEF \u201cwere clearly unrealistic\u201d. Senator Melaye, for example, insisted that the N290=$1 assumption adopted was not \u201cachievable and unrealistic\u201d and therefore described the MTEF as a \u201clie\u201d; while Senate President, Bukola Saraki also agreed that, in addition to exchange rate, the oil price projection of $42.5/barrel, and 3.02% projected GDP growth rate, were respectively also unrealistic. Invariably, the projected oil output of 2.2mb/day may also be unattainable if the scourge of militancy in the Niger Delta remains unresolved. Apart from the Legislators\u2019 concern on the integrity of the MTEF, one might also add that it would be a grave misadventure, if the imminent danger of inflation spiraling beyond 20% is not also recognized as a virulent spoil sport, in any attempt to reverse our dismal current economic trend, especially when further Naira devaluation could also propel petrol and energy prices. So the question is, will the 2017 Budget, like its predecessors also be the hyped stability of a Sandcastle? Indeed, despite the imminent drop in crude oil price and output due to the unfolding, clearly foreseeable trend in the crude oil market and restiveness in the Niger Delta, it was unconscionable that the N6.06Tn 2016 budget accommodated an unexpected 33% increase on the now clearly modest 2015 N4.4Tn budget. Sadly, the bloated expenditure budget for 2016 may have further fuelled inflation to make millions of lives more miserable; worse still, probably against the popular perception of President Buhari\u2019s astute frugality in financial management, recurrent expenditure was inexplicably also significantly increased, only to be partly funded with more high interest loans! Thus, despite the forlorn hope that the seemingly entrenched practice of treasury looting and several other miscellaneous financial leakages, including billions of Naira salaries to thousands of ghost workers, would be arrested, to tame recurrent expenditure, sadly, the reverse, which would further worsen our already debilitating debt burden is now the reality. Unexpectedly, increasing debt consolidation has also instead quickened and Mr. President\u2019s consideration of a fresh $29.9bn loan may ultimately spur debt burden suicidally, closer to $100bn, such that over 50% of total annual income may ultimately be required to service national debts annually. Clearly, the oppressive constraint that such a monstrous debt profile has on national development and social welfare will certainly become far reaching. Indeed, according to the Budget and Planning Minister, who spoke at a recent KPMG CFO forum \u201cgovernment had already spent about N3.577Tn out of the N6.06Tn 2016 budget by 30th September; of this sum, N1.138Tn i.e. over 35% was expended on servicing domestic and foreign debts; regrettably, since the 2016 budget, like others before it were also totally denominated in Naira, the minister did not disclose the source of dollars or what Naira exchange rates were applicable to the dollars exchanged to settle these foreign debts.

Furthermore, according to Ndume, the Budget Minister had also failed so far to respond to the Senate\u2019s request for \u201ca comprehensive report on the implementation of the 2016 budget\u201d. The Senator leader, is also concerned that relevant information have still not been provided for the \u201cfiscal rates, taxes, charges, etc from which the projected N6.80Tn 2017 revenue was derived\u201d. Finally, with regards to debt, Ndume has also demanded a report on the \u201cstructure of debt composition, sources of funds and how borrowed funds are to be spent, as well as a reasonable repayment plan and schedule for national debts\u201d. Similarly, while commenting on the same MTEF, Senate Spokesperson, Senator Abdullahi wondered \u201cif the Federal Executive is not padded with people who want to frustrate the government\u201d. Ultimately, however, the consensus across party divide in the senate was that the critical assumptions predicating the 2016-19 MTEF \u201cwere clearly unrealistic\u201d. Senator Melaye, for example, insisted that the N290=$1 assumption adopted was not \u201cachievable and unrealistic\u201d and therefore described the MTEF as a \u201clie\u201d; while Senate President, Bukola Saraki also agreed that, in addition to exchange rate, the oil price projection of $42.5/barrel, and 3.02% projected GDP growth rate, were respectively also unrealistic. Invariably, the projected oil output of 2.2mb/day may also be unattainable if the scourge of militancy in the Niger Delta remains unresolved. Apart from the Legislators\u2019 concern on the integrity of the MTEF, one might also add that it would be a grave misadventure if the imminent danger of inflation spiraling beyond 20% is not also recognized as a virulent spoil sport, in any attempt to reverse our dismal current economic trend, especially when further Naira devaluation could also propel petrol and energy prices. So the question is, will the 2017 Budget, like its predecessors also be hyped stability of a Sandcastle? Indeed, despite the imminent drop in crude oil price and output due to the unfolding clearly foreseeable trend in the crude oil market and restiveness in the Niger Delta, it was unconscionable that the N6.06Tn 2016 budget accommodated an unexpected 33% increase on the now rather modest 2015 N4.4Tn budget. Sadly, the bloated expenditure budget for 2016 may have further fuelled inflation to make millions of lives more miserable; worse still, probably against the popular perception of President Buhari\u2019s astute frugality in financial management, recurrent expenditure was inexplicably also significantly increased, only to be partly funded with more high interest loans. Thus, despite the forlorn hope that the seemingly entrenched practice of treasury looting and several other miscellaneous financial leakages, including billions of Naira salaries to thousands of ghost workers, would be arrested, to tame recurrent expenditure, sadly, the reverse that would further worsen our already debilitating debt burden is now the reality. Expectedly, increasing debt consolidation has also instead quickened and Mr. President\u2019s consideration of a fresh $29.9bn loan may ultimately spur debt burden suicidally, closer to $100bn, such that over 50% of total annual income may ultimately be required to service national debts annually. Clearly, the constraint that such a monstrous debt profile has on national development and social welfare will certainly become far reaching. Indeed, according to the Budget and Planning Minister, who spoke at a recent KPMG CFO forum \u201cgovernment had already spent about N3.577Tn out of the N6.06Tn 2016 budget by 30th September; of this sum, N1.138Tn i.e. over 35% was expended on servicing domestic and foreign debts; regrettably, since the 2016 budget, like others before it were also totally denominated in Naira, the minister did not disclose the source of dollars or what Naira exchange rates were applicable to the dollars exchanged to settle these foreign debts.

        "text": "By Mohammed Adamu NO sympathy, no antipathy: \u201cNonetheless it is both a moral and legal requirement that in the fight against corruption a political leader must proceed with the utmost detachment and un-affection. He must approach the fight as much without fear or favor as without bias or malice aforethought. He is obligated both by law and by morality to be true to \u2018friends\u2019 and to \u2018foes\u2019 alike. Only thereafter will he be justified -by law and by morality- to ride the chariot of fire and to wield the Sword of Damocles without sympathy and without antipathy.\u201d \u2013from \u2018INTEGRITY AND THE WAR ON CORRUPTION\u2019 -27/01/17 A stitch in time\u2026 \u201cCorruption has a tendency within the shortest possible time to fester from reversible benignity to incurable malignance. The same way a spoilt child grows from remediable delinquency to incorrigible deviance. Left untreated, more and more people become attracted to -or get consumed by- corruption. Either because it is so widespread that the opportunity to benefit from corruption abounds, or because it is so pervasive that the capacity even for otherwise morally-restrainable citizens to resist its influence progressively wanes.\u201d \u2013from \u2018ON DIEZANI\u2019S \u2018BAD LOOT\u2019 -2/01/17 A troika of evil \u201cWe have allowed ourselves to be hijacked by this troika of mischief makers (namely mischievous lawyers, crooked politicians and compromised journalists) who over time have come to the realization of the efficacy of their combined influence over society; and together they now constitute a gangling pack of ravenous hyenas; patient and persevering; nibbling and nagging; squealing and squeaking, they are determined always to go the distance to bring their prey down. National debate What they ignore remains rested; what they want as agenda is set! They will strain at a gnat but they will ignore a whole camel. They will magnify trivia to the height of national debate, but they will look the other way when murder and arson are committed on a scale\u201d. \u2013 from \u2018ON JUSTICE ONONGHEN\u2019 -02/09/17 Comedy of fellows \u201cNigeria has become one huge Elizabethan theatre where clowns, harlequins and pantomimes now prowl the stage in an unending melodrama that is sometimes more comic than Shakespeare\u2019s \u2018Comedy of Errors\u2018. And in this unfortunate milieu it seems we are no longer divided over issues. We are rather titillated by personalities. We are so extreme in the way we canvass opinion nowadays that there is hardly any middle ground left \u2013 neither one as giddy height for the fence sitter, nor any as sanctuary for the non-aligned. We are either protagonistic about personalities or we are antagonistic about them. And either way, we are just simply unapologetic\u201d. \u2013from \u2018METAPHORS FOR A TROUBLED NATION\u2019 \u2013 02/16/17 God and man \u201cwhether we like it or not, man will, sooner or later, \u2018multiply\u2019 to fill the earth\u2019 if not by the legitimate conjugal union of polygamists and monogamists alike, then by the illegitimate philandering of fornicators and adulterers. The earth will have to be filled \u2013 someday; whether we grow its population by geometric or arithmetic progression. It is the failure of selfish political man and not the absence of divine provision that has put the world in the condition of perpetual lack! Political man has learnt to shackle and unsettle the world through the waging of wars and rumors of war, to keep it from attaining the bliss that God has intended for it. It is neither the problem of religion nor the inadequacy of the earth to provide. It is the wickedness of man who politicizes everything including the economics of food \u2013 in a world where the have-nots starve to death and those who have in excess of what they need, often have to dump at sea. Those who continue to rob the economies of most nations are in fact not the most ardent \u2018polygamists\u2019. Many of them are monogamists with a cat or a puppy, for child. Sanusi should leave Muslim polygamists alone.\u201d \u2013from \u2018SANUSI\u2019S WEDLOCK OF THE RICH\u2019 -02/23/17 Alive and kicking \u201cLife\u201d, said \u201cStephen Vincent Benet is not lost by dying; it is lost minute by minute, day by dragging day, in all the thousand small uncaring ways\u201d And maybe it is the reason the Spanish-born U.S. philosopher and poet George Santayana once said: \u201cThe diseases which destroy a man are no less natural than the instincts which preserve him.\u201d Many will die of the most trifling of diseases if they have not the spirit to resist, even as many will survive the most malignant of diseases even without medicament. Or as Edward Bach would say \u201cDisease is in essence the result of conflict between soul and mind\u201d \u2013from \u2018ON BUHARI\u2019S \u2018HALE\u2019 AND \u2018HEARTINESS\u2019 03/01/17 Broken record \u201cPro-Jonathans still insist that although his government was filthy-corrupt, Jonathan himself was unsullied by the torrents of sordid faeces which had bathed it head and trunk, torso to limbs. They admit that although everyone else in the Jonathan Government could be guilty of one form of corruption or maladministration, Jonathan himself was not. And the man is so naively emboldened by the brazen, unscrupulous defense of this army of blind supporters, he has become himself a broken record of Shaggy\u2019s lyric of intransigent self-defense: so that to every allegation of corruption, Jonathan now sings \u2018It wasn\u2019t me\u2019.\u201d \u2013from \u2018NOW THAT JONATHAN IS ON THE MENU -03/09/17\u2019 Gangsterism and the law \u201cThey say that when he headed the Federal Roads Safety Commission FRSC, Major General Haladu Hannaniya wore the Commission\u2019s uniform. But they did not say whether Hannaniya did so in compliance with the Act establishing the Commission or that he did so merely in deference to a non-mandatory tradition. If the law is silent on whether or not non-career political appointees heading paramilitary bodies should wear uniform, why should any who chooses to wear uniform be deemed in compliance with that law or that any who chooses not to, is adjudged in breach of it? By the way if the precedent of Hannaniya wearing FRSC uniform in deference to operational tradition, is the compelling yardstick for judging Ali\u2019s obduracy in not wearing one, why should the precedent of Wole Soyinka, who pioneered the same FRSC but did not wear its uniform, not be even more compelling?\u201d \u2013from \u2018MUCH ADO ABOUT UNIFORM -03/16/17\u2019 Unavailing majority \u201cWhy would an APC-majority-Assembly be poised always to give executive requests from an APC government such hard time? Because APC\u2019s victory at the polls has not been properly managed. This often bi-partisan hostile treatment of presidential requests at the legislature, is an indication not only of the inability of the APC government to manage its legislative majority tactfully, it is also a clear indication that the President\u2019s \u2018Executive Initiative\u2019 at the legislature is not handled with the circumspection, tact and diplomacy that it requires.\u201d \u2013from \u201cBUHARI\u2019S POOR GAME\u2019 -03/23/17 Inter-dependence \u201cIn truth, theoretically or even in practice, there is no such thing as \u2018independence\u2019 of any of the arms of government. No one arm of government is \u2018independent\u2019 of the others. Practice of democracy The doctrine of separation of powers did not envisage that; nor has the practice of democracy in whatever garb made such democratic utopia possible. The three arms of government are mutually inter-dependent, with each enjoying a sphere of independence subject to the constitutionally permissible interference of the others.\u201d \u2013from \u201cWHAT TO DO WITH THE SARAKI NASS\u2019 -03/30/17\u2019 Despotism of kings \u201cThose who should be angry and tearing down fences, are the ones who are preaching law and the due process of law. Yet those who steal our patrimony have not the littlest scruple subverting the law. In truth \u2018singing\u2019 and \u2018swinging\u2019 in a democracy, are not the enemies of law or of the due process of law.

        "author": "Mohammed Adamu",
        "text": "By Mohammed Adamu Continued from last week Ignoble Laurel \u201c\u2026it was at the Prague Conference that I first heard the phrase \u2018grand corruption\u2019, symbolising perhaps a malignant stage of corruption from which it is said that a dangerous alliance can happen between humongously-corrupt politicians and organised business crime groups with the inevitable result that a nation is perpetually held to ransom -as we see in many parts of Latin America. Yet it was on this subject of \u2018grand corruption\u2019 that another moment for Nigeria came up again at the conference; this time alongside Russia. The two countries were singled out for special mention as destinations where corruption had reached \u2018grand\u2019 level and that therefore the threat \u2013in these countries- of the emergence of power groups stronger than government was not only likely, it was nigh and nigh\u201d. \u2013From \u2018GRAND CORRUPTION\u2019 04/20/17 In Defense of the Offending Party \u201cAnd as if merely being in an insensately thieving and retrogressive PDP was not ideologically de-flowering enough for a man of the caliber of Lamido, -hitherto respected as one of the \u2018last few men standing\u2019 for the NEPU/PRP legacy, my friend Sule was to become even more catholic than the Pope in his defense of the so called \u2018fortunes\u2019 of PDP -a political party whose retrogressive ways were the exact antitheses of the principles that Lamido once proudly represented, and personified.\u201d \u2013From \u2018WHAT DOES LAMIDO WANT?\u2019 04/27/17 Jonathan, Our Rasputin \u201cIn the days of his Acting Presidency up to the early period of his Presidency, Jonathan was still an innocent tail wagged by these medley of uninspiring attributes; until the hawks and the hyenas of his political party suddenly began to discover the silver lining inherent in the Jonathan style of profligate, Father-Christmas kind of attitude to governance. And when every covetous knee in PDP shamelessly began to bow before Jonathan\u2019s imprudent munificence, and when they pretentiously began to eulogise the \u2018heroics\u2019 of a grossly under-performing Jonathan, it was then that the man lost his rustic, Otuoke innocence, and suddenly gained the manipulative Rasputin image of an outwardly-benevolent \u2018divine\u2019 but who was always sneakily in pursuit of the politically devious. It was at this point that we began to see a Machiavellic Jonathan who would have no qualms projecting the desperate idea that \u2018A thing worth having is a thing worth cheating for.\u201d From \u2018THE JONATHAN WE CREATED -05/11/17\u2019 Competing for the Skies \u201cAnd sometimes that is just the problem with the weddings, especially of the \u2018insanely rich\u2019 and the \u2018superbly powerful\u2019. Like a gathering of giraffes, they tend always to attract too many tall egos that end up neck-sizing as they compete for the skies. And no matter how long-necked or short-necked they come, in events like that, every giraffe is bound to meet its match, or even its better. And so, sometimes those who can\u2019t humbly hang their low necks beneath the shadows of longer ones, simply come early, brandish their \u2018impala necks\u2019 to be sure they are not counted \u2018absent\u2019, and then run. Or as the Yorubas would say, tuule!\u201d \u2013From \u2018IBB: THE RICH ALSO WED \u2013 05/18/17\u2019 Hypocrisy \u201cSomeone posted on Face book a hypothetical scenario: he wanted to know what his Facebook friends would do if they came upon a cache of millions of dollars in some derelict graveyard, a rundown soak-away or any of the ubiquitous hide-always that have bizarrely come to symbolize the search for looted funds in Nigeria today. Would they blow the whistle and be content with a \u2018meager\u2019 five percent, or would they \u2013if they could get away with it- rather keep all? And nearly seventy percent of those who responded said \u2018to hell with 5%!\u2019 They\u2019ll rather keep every dime of it. One said -with some kind of righteous indignation- \u201cMe, blow whistle ke? I be referee?\u201d And you wonder what kind of people we are, Nigerians? We are offended by corruption but only because it is not us or our own that have the opportunity to perpetrate it. We are disgusted by obscene wealth but only because it does not belong to us or to someone that we are beneficially connected with.\u201d \u2013\u2018 HOW PATRIOTIC IS THE WHISTLE BLOWER? -05/25/17\u2019 True Recognition \u201cA day should long have been set aside to commemorate this great man; not a university\u2019s hard-earned name mangled to mock him!\u2026For a man whose martyrdom watered the tree of the democracy that we enjoy today, true recognition consist only in declaring him President-elect posthumously \u2013which will only be reaffirming that which he was, baring the annulment. And then also to substitute \u2018May 29\u2019 with \u2018June 12\u2019 \u2013which again will not be a gratuity because it will merely recognize the date for what truly it is worth. Then and only then will the anger of the democratic gods be assuaged, and the unsettled spirit of the late MKO properly reposed.\u201d \u2013\u2018 OF JUNE 12 AND MAY 29 -06/01/17\u2019 No Absolutes \u201cIn any case, it is common knowledge that most sovereign states do not recognize the right to self-determination through secession in their constitutions. In fact many constitutions expressly forbid it. By the way in liberal constitutional democracies it appears the principle of \u2018majority rule\u2019 effectively subsumes the right to secession; such that the Supreme Court of the United States held that secession could occur only \u201cthrough revolution, or through consent of the States\u201d \u2013a majority of them. And which brings us to the unpalatable conclusion that there is no absolutism in the gratuity of \u2018self-determination\u2019 by means of secession. Self-determination is a gift to the few by the many -in peace, or a costly \u2018apple of discord\u2019 to be won or lost -in pieces!\u201d \u2013\u2018 BIAFRA: IN PEACE OR IN PIECES -06/08/17\u2019 Ironing the creases \u201cThe law suffers a form of juristic injustice in the hands of conservative judges who impose on themselves \u2018incapacity\u2019 to navigate the labyrinth of the legal system in order to arrive at justice. But it can even be worse in the hands of \u2018liberal\u2019 judges who leave it prostrate at the foothill of unconscionable scavenging lawyers. Without necessarily being conservative, liberal or radical in their judicial world view, most Nigerian judges have this uncanny ability, always to arrive at \u2018unjust\u2019 decisions! (They) are either constrained by \u2018illiberal provisions\u2019 of the law to wrought injustice or they are overwhelmed equally by \u2018liberal provisions\u2019 still, to arrive at injustice. Head or tail what we get always is \u2018judgment\u2019 without \u2018justice\u2019\u2026 The idea that the \u2018hands\u2019 of a judge are \u2018tied\u2019 by \u2018unjust provisions\u2019 of \u2018law\u2019 so that he can only rule in a manner that does not achieve \u2018justice\u2019 is lame, escapist and untenable\u2026 if the \u2018law\u2019 contains impurities which do not conduce to the attainment of justice, it behooves a judge not to surrender to those impurities but to \u2018interpret\u2019, \u2018construe\u2019 or \u2018construct\u2019 the law until it works justice. Said Lord Denning, although a \u201cJudge must not alter the material of which (the law) is woven\u201d, yet \u201che can and should iron out the creases\u201d. \u2013From \u2018JUDGMENT WITHOUT JUSTICE -06/22/17\u2019 Neither here nor there \u201cHow much less of a \u2018federation\u2019 any country can allegedly be said to be merely because it exudes partial \u2018unitary\u2019 attributes or because such country is unable to transit from \u2018power and resource\u2019-sharing to the granting of \u2018substantial autonomy\u2019 to its constituent parts, is a matter more for the contemplation of political science than it is for the consideration of constitutional law. And so the term \u2018true federalism\u2019 essentially is a misnomer, whether it is applied strictly in decrying a nation that \u2018shares power and resources\u2019 rather than grant \u2018substantial autonomy\u2019, or it is applied trivially in the condemnation of a \u2018federation\u2019 that still exhibit unitary attributes. Nigeria is not any less a \u2018federal system\u2019 than any of the world renowned practitioners of it. It is fundamentally wrong to suggest that a system is not a \u2018true federation\u2019 because its two levels of governmental administration are not \u2018co-ordinate and independent\u2019 politically or economically; or that because the extent of the autonomy of the federating units over certain basic issues like resource control, tax administration, security are not profound or absolute.\u201d \u2013\u2018 MUCH ADO ABOUT \u2018TRUE FEDERALISM\u2019 -07/06/17\u2019 His wit, His wisdom \u201cMaitama Sule was not a man of idle epigrams. He weighed his every word. He spoke the English language as effortlessly as he spoke his mother tongue. And although he was not a man of clich\u00e9s or catchphrases, he spoke with aesthetic resonance and with reasoned alliteration. His usually long-drown but enchanting oratory, had always proved the masters wrong, who say that \u2018brevity is the soul of wit\u2019. Brevity was not the soul of Maitama\u2019s kind of \u2018wit. The hallmark of his usually extempore speeches was length and repetition. Yet his asset was more his \u2018wisdom\u2019 than it was his \u2018wit\u2019. For, whereas wit, as they say \u2018is quick, sharp and laughable, wisdom is \u2018calm, composed and sober\u2019. And whereas wit \u2018is the gurgling mountain stream plunging over a jagged waterfall\u2019, wisdom \u2018is the serene\u2019 sea abiding in quiet solitude. Wit is the \u2018language of the jester\u2019 where \u2018wisdom\u2019 is the language of the sage\u2019. And although Maitama was master of all, it cannot be denied that he breathed \u2018wisdom\u2019 into every sphere of our national lives.\u201d \u2013\u2018 STILL ON MAITAMA -07/20/17\u2019 Politics of Health \u201cAnd the question is asked, \u2018when exactly can the President be said to be \u2018incapable\u2019 of discharging the functions of his office? Is it when a \u2018sick\u2019 \u2013or maybe even healthy- President, for whatever reason, feels himself incapable of discharging the functions of his office; or is it when a cynical, or maybe even genuinely critical public, believes, rightly or wrongly, that the President is \u2018incapable of discharging the functions of his office? Or is it only when medical diagnosis confirms that the President is \u2018incapable of discharging the functions of his office\u2019?\u201d \u2013\u2018 ON BUHARI: \u2018SICKNESS\u2019 AS CONSTITUTIONAL OFFENCE -07/27/17\u2019 Going Ultravires \u201cWhen you cut too many corners in making a \u2018square\u2019, they say you can only end up with a \u2018circle\u2019. The NASS, although it is empowered to \u2018make\u2019, \u2018amend\u2019 or \u2018abrogate\u2019 laws, it is not so empowered, by mere quorum-regulated sittings, to legislate to \u2018annul\u2019 the Constitution or by the mere adoption of two-thirds majority, to vote to give to \u2018the people\u2019 a brand new one. It trivialises the sacredness of the whole idea of \u2018constitution-making\u2019; that a few people by the incidence merely of having been elected to parliament, routinely to make, amend or abrogate laws for the order and good governance of the nation, should now arrogate the power to transform into a \u2018constituent assembly\u2019 with a fresh mandate radically to alter the system.\u201d \u2013\u2018 A \u2018RE-MAKE\u2019, NOT AN AMENDMENT -08/03/17\u2019 The Dog wags the tail \u201cCall it dictatorship of the majority. Or the despotism of the \u2018many\u2019 over the contrived subservience of the \u2018few\u2019. It is not necessarily in the merit of its choice or in the morality of its position that the majority is entitled to ride roughshod over the minority, it is merely in the greatness of its number that a \u2018right\u2019 accrues to it legitimately to oppress the minority. But does it not make even moral sense to suggest that the \u2018many\u2019 alone should have a right to decide the fate of the \u2018few\u2019 and not the other way? To the dog is a natural right to wag its tail, and to the tail is a duty to be wagged. For, as the British philosopher A. N. Whitehead asks rhetorically \u201cWhat is morality in any given time or place? It is what the majority then and there happen to like\u201d\u2026. The minority is a \u2018tail\u2019 in the democratic enterprise. It is not equipped to wag the dog. Said Edmund Burke \u201cBecause half a dozen grasshoppers under a fern make the field ring with their importunate chink, whilst thousands of great cattle, reposed beneath the shadow of the British oak, chew the cud and are silent\u2026. do not imagine that those who make noise are the only inhabitants of the field.\u201d \u2013\u2018 IS THE MAJORITY ALWAYS RIGHT? -08/24/17\u2019 To be concluded\u2026 Related",

        "author": "Mohammed Adamu",
        "text": "By Mohammed Adamu Short Speech, Long Speech \u201cAs the speech defines the occasion, and as the occasion defines the speech, great moments of decision making (like that by Shakespeare\u2019s Hamlet when he said \u201cTo be or not to be\u201d), are not attended with the distractions of unmerited anecdotes. Buhari (after his return from London) had occasion to address matters touching on the survival of the State itself (the IPOB threat). He would have done great disservice to the occasion if he bored the nation with the details of his health condition. Such inanity, \u2013at that material time- would have availeth neither him nor the tribulated State. Nor would Buhari have made the desired impact if he had delivered his words that day by \u2018number\u2019 and not by \u2018weight\u2019 -like he did\u201d. \u2013From \u2018THE STUFF THAT SPEECHES ARE MADE 08/31/17\u2019 Osinbajo\u2019s to the rescue \u201c\u2026even as Buhari\u2019s Inaugural Address seems to be his best ever, it will not be the only great speech to come from his government\u2026 (because) Vice President Osinbajo\u2019s Eid-el-Kabir lunch speech at the Banquet Hall of the Presidential Villa, was another excellent one since that inaugural address by his principal -that is if it has not bettered Buhari\u2019s best-ever. Osinbajo\u2019s had all the qualities of a great speech: it has \u2018metre\u2019 and it has \u2018verse\u2019; it has its own unique \u2018figurativeness\u2019 and its own blend of \u2018metaphors. Plus it is rhetorical without exerting itself to be so. And with \u2018sacrifice\u2019 as one of its major themes, the VP\u2019s speech was pleasantly auspicious for the occasion: from its prophetic \u201cThis is a nation that will show forth in culture, in technology and in commerce\u201d, to its divinely-descriptive notion of Nigeria as \u201cGod\u2019s investment in the black race\u201d; and from its emphatic \u201cOur manifest destiny is to be a great nation\u201d, to its divinely predictive \u201cgreat nation that God is about to give birth to\u201d. \u2013From \u2018ON OSINBAJO\u2019S EID SPEECH -09/06/17\u2019 The Cowardly dog \u201cRevolutionaries would say \u2018give us liberty or give us death!\u2019 but Kanu would say: \u2018give me Biafra or I\u2019ll kill you all!\u2019 And you wondered, if he was this mightily strong, shouldn\u2019t he have just taken Biafra off the map instead of demanding that we give it to him? Besides, as he was this violently \u2018mutinous in peace\u2019, would you not have thought that Kanu should be mightily \u2018bold in war\u2019 too? But no; even before the beagle of war was blown, and the alarum of battle sounded, the man whose \u2018sneeze\u2019 had allegedly given \u2018cold\u2019 to the \u2018zoo\u2019 he called Nigeria, had already fled. Kanu had caught the \u2018courage\u2019 of the \u2018cowardly dog\u2019. Or as the Hausas would say: \u2018yaa ari ta kare\u2019! To prove that he is after all a coward.\u201d \u2013From \u2018KANU: A PARODY -09/21/17\u2019 Myopic \u2018CAN\u2019 \u201cThe earliest Western Church had a clear reputation for fighting \u2018usury\u2019 (interest) or \u2018riba\u2019 as it is called in Arabic. And even though the medieval Church had inadvertently mis-conducted itself to pave the way for usury to become the primum mobile of all capitalist transactions, in fairness to the Christian West it continues to remain \u2013till today- receptive to superior alternative currents of ideas including from Arabia from whence it once benefited. But by a curious \u2013nonetheless ridiculous- twist of irony, the Christian Association of Nigeria, CAN, strains secular logic in defense of \u2018usury\u2019. And which makes CAN laughably less catholic than the Pope -hating everything \u2018Islamic\u2019, so much that it is prepared to embrace everything anti-Christic! In truth non-interest banking is as biblical as it is Islamic. Just as \u2018head-covering\u2019 (or hijab) for the female also is.\u201d \u2013From \u2018RE-VISITING \u2018CAN\u2019S DESCENT TO THE MEDIEVAL\u2019 -10/05/17\u2019 The Three \u2018R\u2019s \u201cThere is urgent need for the reconciliation, rehabilitation, and reconstruction of the Igbo nation, starting from the convening of a \u2018National Truth and Reconciliation Commission\u2019, where these questions would be answered to the satisfaction of all Nigerians. With full immunity from prosecution, all the actors, past and present, their heirs or assigns, can come and tell their own side of the story, by way of accepting responsibility for their actions or inactions, and seeking forgiveness. This has worked well in many countries of the world and is ideal for beginning the process to preserve Nigeria\u2019s unity; not by sweeping it all under the carpet and pretending it never happened, or by stopping the study of history in schools, and definitely not by the brutal suppression of agitators. This is where Mohammed Adamu\u2019s considerable writing and opinion making skills are needed\u201d. \u2013From \u2018STILL ON \u2018KANU: A PARODY\u2019 -10/11/17 (RIGHT OF REPLY BY Emeka Ukpabi)\u2019 Mad Man or Visionary? \u201cGaddafi was a man of dual racial origin, -an Arab and an African; a bona fide member of two continental bodies: the Arab League and the African Union. He was author of \u2018The Green Book\u2019 \u2013a mystery book containing an ingenious Afro-Arab philosophy offering the world a \u2018Third Universal Theory\u2019 or a practical alternative to Western capitalist-democracy and Eastern European communism\u2026 Said one oriental writer: \u201cWhereas Plato\u2019s \u2018The Republic\u2019 still remains the blueprint of a utopian society waiting to be experimented, Gaddafi\u2019s \u2018Green Book\u2019 is itself the product of a practical revolution which has radically transformed Libya\u201d. The American media especially had persistently played up Gaddafi\u2019s often nationalistic, afro-Arab ideology to propagate hostile information designed to portray him as \u2018mad\u2019 and to divert the attention especially of the Arab world and Africa from his message.\u201d \u2013From \u2018GADDAFI: TRIBUTE TO A REVOLUTIONARY -10/18/17\u2019 Profit And Profiteers \u201cWailers are either unrepentant pro-Jonathans or they are unapologetic anti-Buharis. Or both. They are generally pro-looting \u2013some unabashedly so; others in a dissembling, hypocritical manner. Or they are pro those who are known to have looted \u2013either for beneficial, geo-political or ethno-religious reasons. And these are \u2018Wailers by choice\u2019 only. There are also \u2018Wailers of necessity\u2019: the looters themselves; or those who fear they may be accused of looting. \u2018Wailers of necessity\u2019 have to either wail by themselves or spend humongous amount to promote wailing. It is the only way they hope to distract the \u2018eagle\u2019 from swooping; or to keep the hangman\u2019s noose away from their fattened necks\u2026 But there are also \u2018Wailers by circumstances\u2019. And these are partisan, dye-in-the-wool PDP apologists. They may not have ever looted. They may not have ever benefitted from looting. But like the restless hyenas that they are, they are driven by an avidly-jumpy gene that gives them hope they just might be tomorrow\u2019s lucky looters.\u201d \u2013From \u2018WAILERS\u2019 VERSUS \u2018HAILERS\u2019 -10/26/17\u2019 The limit of prejudice \u201cAll the theories around Buhari\u2019s alleged cronyism and nepotism especially concerning appointments and the claim of \u2018excessive\u2019 indulgence of favoured appointees, centre around ethnicity, religion and geo-polity. They allege that the President favours only the Hausa-Fulanis, Muslims and especially core Northerners \u2013provided they are Muslims. And from this premise Babachir then becomes a perfect anti-theory for the reason that he is neither a Muslim, nor Hausa, nor Fulani, nor Hausa-Fulani. And yes, Babachir may pass for a \u2018core Northerner\u2019 \u2013coming from the far North- but he does so with qualification: he is a core \u2018Northern Christian\u2019, one of a Northern minority groups that anti-Buharists allege he (Buhari) hates, -and maybe who equally hate Buhari.\u201d \u2013From \u2018BABACHIR, \u2018CABAL\u2019 AS ANTI-THEORY -11/02/17\u2019 One bad apple \u201cEl-Rufai\u2019s \u2018teachers\u2019 should confound both popular wisdom and the sayings even of the masters. If, as the saying goes, \u2018one bad apple spoils the bunch\u2019, well then what\u2019ll twenty one thousand bad ones do -to the bunch, and to innocent fingerlings that should feed from the bunch? Or if, as Robert Green Ingersoll wrote that \u201cOne good schoolmaster is worth a thousand priests\u201d, what then will twenty one thousand \u2018bad\u2019 schoolmasters be worth? Said Ralph Waldo Emerson, \u201cThe man who can make hard things easy is the educator\u201d \u2013namely the teacher. But then what do we make of El-Rufai\u2019s 21,000 \u2018educators\u2019 to whom evidently even the easiest things appear to be the hardest? Who\u2019ll teach who, between the teacher and the pupil?\u201d \u2013\u2018TEACHERS OR CHEATERS? -11/16/17\u2019 See no evil, Hear no evil \u201cAs he turns sixty, -and even as he watches the sordid entrails of his six-year misadventure in governance daily exposed- former President Goodluck Jonathan, still rides on his high political horse, claiming as always that while he was in office, he saw no evil, he heard no evil and that he did no evil. And you wonder who is deceiving who \u2013between the false priest himself and the gullible congregation that lives in denial or that truly cannot tell the \u2018dubious\u2019 from the \u2018divine\u2019 in the political life of Jonathan. What is ridiculous however is not that they call him a \u2018hero of democracy\u2019; but that Jonathan too carries on as though he is the \u2018Ataturk\u2019 of a disputed \u2018modern\u2019 Nigeria. And you do not know whether to be amazed or to be amused by this comic display of inanity.\u201d \u2013\u2018 JONATHAN @60: LEST WE FORGET -11/23/17\u2019 \u2018Cowardice\u2019 is a choice \u201cWhen a trembling, dagger-wielding Macbeth, in Shakespeare\u2019s tragic play \u2018Macbeth\u2019, says to his avidly ruthless wife \u201cIf we should fail\u201d, the villain of implacable ambition, namely Lady Macbeth, only charges: \u201cscrew your courage to the sticking place and we\u2019ll not fail!\u201d. Screwing his \u2018courage to the sticking place\u2019 is what Atiku has consistently been doing. It is a mettle which even Macbeth has to be nudged by a woman to cultivate. But it has always come in handy with an Atiku; -the courage to mount his gilded horse of ambition, and to soldier on; never cowardly asking, like Macbeth, \u201cIf we should fail\u201d; because he knows always that as much as a chivalry charge can fail, it can also succeed.\u201d \u2013From \u2018ON ATIKU\u2019S AMBITION -11/30/17\u2019 The charity of his \u2018Silence\u2019 \u201cOver the years Obasanjo has managed to shape up to be a portent augury for or against those who aspire to be presidents of Nigeria. If you cannot get his open endorsement\u2026 at the very least you should endeavour to negotiate the charity of his silence -so that a divining Obasanjo does not pronounce his potent augury against your candidature. The charity of Obasanjo\u2019s silence alone on the candidature of any politician is electorally mojo enough in itself to take to electoral battle. You cannot aspire to be Nigeria\u2019s President and afford the ruthlessness of Obasanjo\u2019s open denunciation. What Jonathan and the rest of them should do (rather than hope that Obasanjo will ever forgive Atiku) is to prepare Atiku to de-mythify this myth about Obasanjo and not waste their time angling to profit from it. By Obasanjo\u2019s rules of war, Atiku is not entitled to his forgiveness. Let alone his open endorsement. Hell, Atiku may not even be entitled to the charity of Obasanjo\u2019s silence.\u201d \u2013From \u2018STILL \u2018ON ATIKU\u2019S AMBITION\u2019 -12/07/17\u2019 Who\u2019s Jerusalem? -12/14/17 \u201c\u2026identifying \u2018Palestine\u2019 today as a post-Abrahamic, post-Israelite or post-Judean creation, is both anachronistic and historically fallacious because the \u2018Palestinians\u2019\u2026 had been there at Canaan as people of the \u2018Jordan River\u2019 long before Abraham arrived from what the Bible says was Ur of the Chaldea (Iraq), some 1500 years before Christ was born. When he arrived Canaan Abraham had met these people\u2026 and had to settle down amongst them to father Isaac who the Bible tells us sired Jacob, who would be called \u2018Israel\u2019 and who was therefore to begin the lineage of a God\u2019s own people, namely the Israelites. And down the line to the birth of Judah, who would be the progenitor of the Jewish tribe, the precursor of the Jewish religion, and the father of the Judean nation. Meaning that the people of the \u2018Jordan river\u2019 (or the Canaanites who would be Arabized as the future Palestinians), and the cities and towns of that community of the \u2018Jordan river\u2019 had all existed long before the birth of Israel, Israelites, Jews, Judaism, or Judea.

        "author": "Ugoji Egbujo",
        "text": "By Ugoji Egbujo A new year has come. It has come with old and fresh hopes. It will encounter reality and hopes that aren\u2019t well founded, will crumble quickly. Then the year willpeter out, like the one that preceded it. And a load of failed expectations will be optimistically deferred, hurled, to the subsequent one. 2016 had come with many hopes. Naira was still 198 to a dollar \u2013 officially- then. The disparity between that rate and the black market\u2019s (N260 per dollar) was considered frightening.That crazy black market exchange rate was the handiwork of unscrupulous speculators, we were told. Those were the good old days, it now seems. Then, they bothered to give excuses. The naira is now prostrate at N500 per dollar, and they aren\u2019t saying anything. The gulf between the ratesis now large enough to swallow the Atlantic, but the government is no longer rattled by it. When 2016 came we were told the bleeding vessels of the economy would be tied up. The government, they said, was in full deliberate control. We believed because they never seemed to be in any panic,they spoke with knowing ease. Then we, cheerfully , slipped into a deep recession. They won\u2019t take any responsibility for the decline. They kept cheerful and knowing faces. You don\u2019t know if they understand pain because not even their tone has changed. You read their messages of hope twice and you can\u2019t but hiss. Where is the substance? Where is a clear plan? Don\u2019t look for it, thou man of little faith. Their inexplicable assuredness rebukes doubt and scrutiny. Naira is dying from the \u2018issue of blood\u2019 and they are still smiling the smiles of messiahs. We thought they had something up their sleeves in 2016: A miracle worker/magician could have been strolling down from somewhere, wanting things to get thoroughly messed up before he arrived , so that the redemption is breathtaking. They made us dream dreams. You can\u2019t stillmake out if it\u2019s lack of empathy or too much of it. This seeming nonchalance. A patient on life support cannot trust thefaces her doctors put forward to reveal any direness. But she can always gleam turmoil from their occasional franticness. With these ones in Abuja, it\u2019s baffling imperturbability. The budget of 2016, we were told, would do economic wonders. It failed miserably. But no one has come clear. We had no money to fund that budget. We may not have any money to fund this new one. There is nothing in the 2017 budget indicative of repentance. Kitchen utensils and other sinful items have made a noisy comeback. Soon \u2018paddings\u2019 will reappear. And they will bicker and bicker, and pass the budget when it has lost allmeaning. The Avengers and their political sponsors haven\u2019t disappeared yet. And we are helpless against them. Yet we can, insouciantly, announce- we will come out of recession soon. When a man finds himself in a suffocating predicament, he can embrace denial for temporary relief. But you would think that the affairs of a nation should be handled more truthfully , more soberly. So that,if padlocking naira at 315 per dollar makes CBN and government officials emergency billionaires, then a policy change would be effected in a hurry. But they will do nothing but say- \u201cwe are on top of it!\u201d Yes, they are on top of it. Violent herdsmen are still on the loose, everywhere. Whole villages were ruined in 2016, and not a flicker of real deterrence has been seen anywhere. There is no urgency, none that is reassuring, none that makes a distinction between cattle and human life. We arebeing conditioned to take the massacres as inevitable.Like trees, shedding their leaves, occasionally, seasonally. We are now accustomed to gory spectacles, intestines and all. Everyone seems to know the source of the impunity of the herdsmen, except the federal government. The federal government is shackled byparochial cattle- rearing sentiments. We can leave it at that. The Army , even the army, is now talking cattle ranches and cattle rearing. It\u2019s 2017, but the violent herdsmen wont just disappear. It will be a great year, that\u2019s what they have said. But the two political parties have their fingers firmly on self -destruct buttons. The ruling party has shed its sanctimoniousness. It has admitted too many leprous elements. But hasn\u2019t it always had an abundance of those? The real tragedy is that it now has a torn soul. And since it has learnt not to tackle anything headlong, it won\u2019t stitch. So itsdecay will continue and its collapse may be sudden. Tinubu and Oyegun\u2019s public spat has left the party permanently diminished and potentially moribund. How can the party of \u2018change\u2019 keep a national chairman whom its national leader has publicly branded a fraudster, an impostor? What lofty ideals can such a party still pretend to? Not righteousness, not fairness, and definitely, not unity.Tinubu and Oyegun are now mutually incompatible. But they look at us with smiling faces and say \u2013 \u201call is well, politics is about conflicts\u201d The opposition party is in rags. All it does is \u2013 howl and howl. If it stares hard into 2017, it must see abject bleakness. The imminent disintegration of the PDP is a major set back for our political growth. PDP was many ugly things, but it was inclusiveness and consensus. Another party may rise from its ashes, but can any be as unifying as the PDP. The problems of the PDP are complicated by the fact that it is the party vociferously making excuses for corruption. Buying of votes aside, no opposition party can appeal to the poor with such a message. Workers have become bleating mules. Their salaries are tethered, andrampant winds of inflation have left it threadbare. But they won\u2019t even get those frayed notes without tears. And no one will tell them anything besides sophistry: \u201cThe economic diversification policy of this and that government is on course,blablabla\u2026\u2026\u2026..\u201d Wouldn\u2019t you think that peoplewillfool themselves up to an extent, up to the brink, and then pull back from destruction? What has changed in the states where governors with itchy fingers, who know nothing besides the rigging of elections and self aggrandizement, preside? What will change in 2017? The purchasing power of workers will remain wretched, and their families will continue bleating in 2017. That is the truth. The truth is that despite Buhari\u2019s anti corruption stance, policemen will continue to extort motorists in 2017 in plain public view. The government is utterly helpless. The Customs officials at Semeborder will continuewith their customary brazenness. The government will tell you some vacuous stuff:\u2018change starts with you\u2019. Lecturers will sell marks for sex and cash, everywhere. Yes, because thousands of them who sold marks last year are better off than those of them who held back and didn\u2019t sell. No one was prosecuted. Soldiers of God had their way in 2016. They killed Patience Agbahime in broad daylight and got away. Why wouldn\u2019t they soothe their bloodthirstiness again? It\u2019s not easy for any government to contend with so much confusion. But the confidence of the people is not retained by empty consolations and wishfulness alone. Lack of responsiveness and absence of visible plans , in theface of worsening social circumstances, create gloom and hopelessness. When you get to the local wing of the Port Harcourt airport don\u2019t walk pass without a thought. Spare a thought for Jonathan, Wike and Amaechi. Imagine the contribution of the region to the national economy. Ask anyone near you: \u201cwhat is really happening?\u201dWhile he fumbles for an answer, throw a cathartic, tufiakwa!at those makeshift tents. Related",

        "text": "By Henry Boyo THE National Bureau of Statistics (NBS), reported in March this year, that Nigeria\u2019s annual Gross Domestic output had grown by 0.82% by December 2017; this marginal growth rate has nonetheless, been commended generally, as a welcome reversal from the negative -1.58% contraction recorded in domestic output by December 2016. Notably, however, the related euphoria from the marginal annual growth rate, is probably lost on millions of our countrymen, who still endure severe economic and social deprivations, without any hope of respite. Consequently, the relevant question, therefore, is whether the collective pangs of hunger and deepening mass poverty, which are largely driven by double digit inflation and unemployment rate above 20%, can be ameliorated by the positive growth rate, recorded by NBS. This question and related issues will be examined, hereafter, in the following interrogative prose. Please read on: Does the reported annual GDP growth of 0.82% for 2017 suggest that Nigeria\u2019s economy has turned the corner, after the contraction recorded in output of goods and services between 2016-2017? Can we begin to expect improvement in social welfare, poverty reduction and employment opportunities? The present modest rise in GDP is primarily instigated, as in the past, by the spike in oil price, from near $30/barrel to a steady $60-70/barrel in recent times. Consequently, if crude prices further rise or remain stable above $60/barrel, the related statistical rise in GDP rate may infact exceed 10% as recorded in 2003 and 2004 when oil price bounced to $42.9 and $56.7/barrel respectively. However, if as usual, such higher growth rates, remain primarily pumped up by higher crude oil price and revenue, then, the higher growth rates recorded may, regrettably actually fail to drive inclusive growth or improve social welfare in Nigeria. So, if per-chance oil price further rises and instigates double digit growth rates in output, shouldn\u2019t we then expect that, employment opportunities will increase and that life will be \u2018more abundant\u2019 and equitable in Nigeria? Well, it depends, on what happens to inflation; this is not the first time that oil price has been very favourable. In fact, oil price was exceptionally high at $140/barrel in 2008, and, yet the GDP grew by just about 10%. Unfortunately, however, inflation also ran into double digits at 11.6% during the same period. Instructively, an inflation rate of 10% will, invariably, wipe off 50% purchasing power of all income earners every five years, and impoverish everyone with static incomes; thus, pensioners particularly, and millions of other Nigerians, whose incomes are predicated on the legislated minimum wage will become very very vulnerable. Consequently the current inflation rate of about 15% will inevitably also increase social deprivation and inequality. So, do you mean that higher crude oil prices and revenue can actually make us poorer? The answer is self evident, from a historical perspective, as explained above. Oil price may never again approach $140/barrel, but at least, we know that when, such exceptionally high price prevailed, the related bountiful dollar revenue did not, ironically, induce any significant improvement in mass social welfare and national economic development. Unfortunately, the relatively high rates of inflation, which also evolved, not only severely contracted consumer demand but also instigated higher cost of borrowing to make productive investment very expensive and risky. Arguably, Nigeria also fell into the ball pack of the world\u2019s poorest nations, even when oil prices shot up from below $10/barrel in 1999 and rose to $140/barrel in 2008. Furthermore, the Naira exchange rate has also inexplicably collapsed from less than N80=$1 with barely $4bn reserves between 1995-8 to N305-360/$1 with over $40bn reserves and still rising in 2018. So are you saying that increasing oil price and dollar reserves, may not necessarily facilitate, the provision of, better education and health facilities, improved transportation, power supply and social welfare benefits with rapidly increasing job opportunities and credible national security? Yes, you are right, the above realities are well amplified in our recent economic history. So, why are we unable to translate increasing export revenue and dollar reserves to the creation of a much \u2018better life\u2019 with less inequality for our people? Obviously, the process adopted for the infusion of our oil export revenue into the economy is responsible for the unexpected distortion to our reasonable expectations for a \u2018better life\u2019. The present payment model, invariably suggests, that increasing income from crude export may actually instigate GDP growth, in statistical terms, but the \u201cwrongheaded\u201d payments system adopted for infusion of dollar revenue has unfortunately, continued to challenge the attainment of truly inclusive growth. Invariably, the product of this aberration, in the forex infusion process, is vividly reflected in the oppressive eternal presence of bloated Naira surpluses which continuously feed and sustain higher rates of inflation, every time, dollar allocations become substituted with Naira vouchers by CBN. So the reality seems to be that higher dollar earnings unwittingly increase the threat of spiraling inflation and therefore reduces the purchasing power of all incomes to deepen mass poverty! So, is there a way out of this double-digit inflation rate? How can we make life better for more Nigerians? The simple answer is to bring down inflation to international best practice rates below 3%, so that income values will also be protected, across board to sustain a level of consumer demand that will spur productive investment and create more jobs. Infact best practice management of inflation is the first battlefront of any responsible Administration. It is for this reason that the CBN is constitutionally empowered to manage price stability, so that the living standards of every wage earner will be protected. Unfortunately CBN\u2019s attraction to a subordinate role as a monopolist supplier of forex, has possibly dimmed the vision of the Apex bank from the prime object of its existence. So, if inflation comes down to best practice rate below 3%, will the level of poverty diminish? Incidentally, with inflation below 3%, CBN\u2019s monetary policy rate, which determines the cost of borrowing, will also plummet to make the abiding dream of manufacturers for 5% interest rate on loans possible. Invariably, with increased production and other economic activities, more job opportunities will also be created while government will similarly expand its revenue base from additional personal and corporate taxes. Final question, how do you bring down inflation to best practice below 3%? CBN should stop compounding the unforced error of persistent Naira surplus whenever it creates more Naira as payment for dollar denominated allocations to the 3 tiers of government. This simple reform will gradually quell the threat of persistent Naira liquidity which drives inflation and pulverizes the Naira exchange rate beyond the public\u2019s comfort zone.

        "text": "By Ugoji Egbujo 2017, you started in a hurry. You had barely arrived when you forced a medical leave on our president. We won\u2019t forget you in a hurry. You misled prophets. They looked at the falling naira and prophesied that it was headed for the abyss. They read economic forecasts and said, God said. Irreverent 2017, you exposed their charlatanism. Naira rose from its drunken stupor at 520 per dollar and has since sat clear-eyed at 360 per dollar. Hopefully, pastors and soothsayers would learn to talk about only floods, scientific discoveries and other mundanities. But 2017, you played too many games with pastors. You arranged one garrulous Daddy Freeze to irritate a multitude of Daddy GOs. You need deliverance, 2017. You made the theology of tithing the talk of beer parlors and strip bars. Many who had not read the Bible in ages, looked up Malachi. Someone lamented that you caused tithes to slump in many churches. You said you only wanted to clear up doctrinal confusion. But some said that you made the men of the underworld happy. You made them learn Malachi chapter 3, and realize many of the dignitaries that litter our society could perhaps be robbers. Malachi says tithe defaulters are all robbers. 2017, you didn\u2019t just fool prophets, you turned many mortals into prophets of death. One governor was sure Buhari had died. The other had pictures of his lifeless body in a London morgue. Bigotry beat drums in Port Harcourt and political opponents and their hirelings danced to Buhari\u2019s death on the streets. The North was perpetually meeting with the military those days. You turned grown men into rumor mills. You raised devilish hopes and crashed them like the devil. When Buhari returned a few thought it was his double from Sudan. They refused to stop believing that Buhari was dead. That former Aviation minister is not a mad man. But his theory of \u2018corpsocracy\u2019 was one only lunacy nor severe drunkenness could saddle on any adult mind. 2017, you made \u2018hale and hearty\u2019 lose its meaning. 2017, you how did you arrange so many fights but didn\u2019t book a ring for any. The DSS versus the EFCC loomed for so long. Ringside tickets were already being printed in Oluwole street. The president\u2019s ambivalence guaranteed its rating as the \u2018fight of the year.\u2019 But after the promotional show at the Senate chambers and the other one at a street in Mataima, you disappointed many fans seeking amusement in a beleaguered economy. Other tantalizing offers like the Head of Service versus the Chief of Staff, the Kogi governor versus Senator Melaye, and a mouth-watering Kachikwu versus Baru, all didn\u2019t hold. 2017, you toyed and teased. The IPOB was the gate of their heaven. Nnamdi Kanu left the prison and became an emperor in one week. Many, including senior politicians, had started bowing publicly before him. 2017, you were such a hopeless tease. You bared unclothed fame at him and his group. They stood imperiously erect. Then you brought in pythons for a dance. What followed was equally cataclysmic. Nobody knows exactly what the python swallowed and what has since squirreled into a deep wintry hole. November 18 came and went. There was no referendum but there were elections. You burst the IPOB hot air balloon. 2017, you were a little harsh on Spanish separatists too. You showed early signs of ruthlessness. You took ECOWAS soldiers to the Gambia and put out the nuisance, Yahya Jammeh. When you turned on Pa Mugabe, we thought it was a joke. But you saw it through. That was a crafty maneuver. You have left Kenya in limbo. You know the consequences are incubating. You know Raila Odinga didn\u2019t boycottt the elections to retire and die in an old people\u2019s home. We all thought you would relieve South Africa of Zuma. We held our breaths and waited for you to hang him dry with an impeachment. You let him off and gave him a statue in Owerri. How then did you pick your victims? You crashed MMM but you let Bitcoin soar. You let Arewa loquacious Youths slip off. You let Maina slip in and slip out. You let a bumbling Malami hang in there with moonlight tales. Yet you let Babachir fall because he cut grasses. And you allowed pythons swallow a motormouthed Director born of the tribe of Judah. We wanted Alex Ekwueme to linger with us, but you broke our hearts. You talked too much 2017. You allowed Mrs Aisha Buhari announce the banishment of hyenas and jackals. We made our \u2018asoebis\u2019 and brought out drums. But the Hyenas and Jackals have remained unperturbed, seated in very high places. You said the heads of those who smuggled Abdulrasheed Maina back into the civil service would roll. But the president has tucked away the Maina report under his pillow, and he sleeps more soundly on it. You talked too much 2017. You fooled us with that two month whistleblowing frenzy. We thought you would help us whistle corruption to death. But after that Kaduna bungalow and the Ikoyi flat, you allowed whistleblowing to go out of fashion 2017, you could\u2019t keep secrets. Everyone now knows that George H.W Bush pinched the buttocks of women while taking photographs. Children now know that Harvey Weinstein begged to have it for just one minute. You allowed the excavation of buried matters. You made decent men lose their hard-won reputation and become mere he-goats. Thank God you didn\u2019t let Nigerian women join the #MeToo train. God could have simply brought forward the Apocalypse. It\u2019s okay that you stopped at Senator Abba Ibrahim and his threesome crew. But you weren\u2019t all mischief. You took Atiku Abubakar back to the PDP. The party was in literal tatters. The commonsense Senator now dreams a president Atiku. That is heart warming. The nation needs an opposition that does more than frothing divisiveness and raving like a rabid dog. I must thank you for arranging the capture of Evans, the kidnapper, after 5 years of elusiveness. You took away the menace of VIO\u2019s from Lagos roads and you exposed the madness of SARS. We are grateful. But you must think of what to do with the APAPA traffic. And of course the fuel scarcity. Please suggest to 2018 the need to remove petrol subsidy and deregulate the market. The job reports are not good. 2018 must do something radical. I have a personal request, 2017. I know you don\u2019t really have any time left. But please before you leave. Can you help me dismantle the cabal? Related",

        "author": "Dr. Ugoji Egbujo",
        "text": "By Dr. Ugoji Egbujo The nation is in darkness. It needs stable Power. Mambila Hydro Plant is a major plank in our power plans. Our contribution is 15% of the total cost. That contribution is 312 billion naira. We budgeted 18 billion naira for it in 2007. In 2018, we have proposed 9.8 billion naira. Rome was not built in a day. But at this rate, Mambilla Hydro may never be built. The second Niger Bridge was promised in 2011. It didn\u2019t make the budget till 2015. The project has a cost of about 117 billion naira. When we released 2 billion naira a few months ago for the project we blew trumpets. In the 2018 budget proposal we allocated to the project only 10 billion naira. Evidently the second Niger bridge is a long way away. Four budgets have met local wing of the Port Harcourt airport. They have all left it in its tattered state. The Enugu-Onitsha road has remained impassable after 5 annual budgets. It\u2019s unlikely 2018 would look its way with any real intent. It\u2019s even worse. Only a fraction of these paltry sums allocated to these important projects will be eventually released before we go into another ritual. So barely 4 months after he signed the 2017 budget, the president was in the National Assembly. He delivered a speech that lasted over an hour. That was remarkable. That must have felt like a marathon for him. It was 2018 budget proposals. He came with the usual overflowing entourage. He was there in December 2016 to present the 2017 budget of recovery and growth. That budget got lost a few times. By the time it was born, it had spent half its life in the womb. It came with maggots too. It\u2019s one month to its expiration now. The capital projections in that budget have been left largely unattended to. President Buhari agrees that budget has literally not been implemented, fundamentally. Only a paltry 20% of capital votes has been released. That budget had been praised for its 30% capital vote. President Buhari calmed frayed legislative nerves. He promised he would do some magic in what is left of the year. He would get 50% of budgeted capital votes released in the next one month. The 2016 budget before it suffered a similar fate. By the December of 2016 only 18% of capital votes had been released. The budget was rolled over. It\u2019s life was extended to march 2017. That extension allowed the budget set a record. It managed to achieve 75% capital projection compliance. The excuse for non compliance has been the same. Expected revenues could not be realized. Projected loans could not be sourced. So why the fuss about another budget presentation? All the budgets have looked alike, watery. The 2018 budget of 8.6 trillion naira looks large. But it\u2019s essentially hollow. Its recurrent expenditure estimates stand at a head spinning 3.4 trillion naira. It has a provision of a whooping 2 trillion naira for servicing existing debts. With nothing left for infrastructural development , It had to have a deficit of 2 trillion which will be financed by borrowing, largely. No one is certain loans would be found. The finance minister hasn\u2019t found loans to service the 2017 capital budget yet. A close look at that budget shows that it plans to walk on a tight rope. 2017 was a little fortunate, stable. Oil is projected to remain at about 45 dollars a barrel. That\u2019s optimistic. 2018 oil production is projected at 2.3million barrels a day. That could be optimistic too. There are already rumbles in the Niger Delta. And there is no visible urgency on the part of the Federal Government to check the situation. The budget leaves no margins for disruptions. Yet 2018 is election eve. There has been no real attempt to reform the public service. The president announced the recurrent expenditure projections of 3.5 trillion with discomfort. He told the legislators that he has placed an embargo on employments into the ministries and agencies. But it was the same president who last week announced he would appoint more ministers to placate his party men. He had said that the nation now had the funds to pay more ministers. The size of our recurrent expenditure leaves the nation perpetually malnourished and leaves little hope for meaningful development. It is true we have saved billions by weeding out ghosts. The independent Payroll and Personnel information System has been useful. But the public service needs a radical surgery. Exorcising ghosts is good , but pruning indolence, thousands of workers, is unavoidable. Our systems have to be digitalized Nigeria seeks to realize over 4 trillion from non oil receipts. That again is optimistic. Independent revenues and recoveries have fallen short in 2017 as they did in 2016. When they fall short, capital projects bear the brunt. So if these proposals are founded on so much optimism why are we excited again? I watched the finance minister promote the 2017 budget. I saw the conviction on her face. Then I saw her lament it\u2019s failed implementation a few weeks ago. She simply said, they couldn\u2019t find the money to finance it. And that was that. So why all the fanfare again? I heard the legislators shelved a protest against non implementation of the 2017 budget. They believe approved budgets are laws that must be obeyed. That\u2019s too idealistic. A budget that relies on exaggerated ability to mop up revenues and on the benevolence of potential creditors cannot be such a binding law. That misunderstanding must be why they trample on themselves to infiltrate budgets with dubious items in the name of constituency projects. Our budgets would be laws the day we earn more than what we plan to spend. Rather than these wasteful ceremonies , the executive and the legislators should sit-down and reconstruct the recurrent expenditure. We have to be clear eyed. These rigmaroles help no one. We should only borrow to fund infrastructural projects that have beneficial multiplier effects on the economy. We are already drowning in wasteful debts. We can\u2019t live prodigally, borrowing to pay salaries. Let them sit down and make sure there are no maggots in this budget. We can\u2019t afford to dedicate hundreds of millions of naira to the Aso Rock kitchen every year and hope to become another Singapore. Let them sit down and block the leakages in revenue collection. JAMB remitted 7.8 billion naira recently but it had remitted only 3 million in a whole decade, previously. The government once talked about selling assets. Now it\u2019s just idling while social infrastructure rots. Related",

        "author": "Henry Boyo",
        "text": "By Henry Boyo The Deputy Speaker of the House of Representatives, Yusuff Lasun disclosed, last week, that the National Assembly, would interrupt its annual recess and reconvene, sometime, this week, to consider an expenditure proposal for N242bn for conducting 2019 General Elections. It is unclear, why President Mohammed Buhari omitted this item in the appropriation bill, presented to the National Assembly in November 2017. Buhari presenting 2018 budget to joint NASS session Although, NASS, also, unexpectedly ignored this glaring omission, curiously, nonetheless, the Legislators, clearly, remembered to allocate N578bn for \u201cconstituency projects, for themselves without prior agreement with the Budget office. Incidentally, the N9.1Tn 2018 budget, which is, nominally, Nigeria\u2019s largest annual fiscal plan ever, was presented to the NASS by President Buhari in November 2017; regrettably, Legislators\u2019 approval was delayed till May 2018, while Buhari also belatedly assented the bill on June 20th, 2018 i.e. 6 months into the budget year. Invariably, the extended delay may have severely doused any hope of successfully implementing this year\u2019s budget. It seems however that, no lesson was learnt from the unresolved challenges that, ultimately, resulted in the expenditure of ONLY N1.49Tn out of the N2.029Tn actually allocated for Capital projects in 2017; similarly, the chances are slim that the total Capital budget of N2.8Tn for 2018 will also be fully applied. However, Mr President\u2019s, belated request, in July i.e. less than a month after his assent to the 2018 budget, for permission from the National Assembly to alter the expenditure pattern of the already enacted 2018 fiscal plan, so that the N242bn, required for 2019 elections can be deducted, from the sum of N578bn, already appropriated, by NASS, for its members\u2019 constituency projects in 2018. The begging question here, of course, is why Buhari endorsed the Appropriation Act in June, only to turn round, barely 3 weeks after, to contradict his endorsement, with a request for virement. Invariably, with the apparent, incessant discord between the Presidency and a National Assembly, ultimately, a probable compromise, would be for Buhari to submit a fresh supplementary Appropriation bill, separately, for the 2019 elections, rather than insist on a virement for N242bn. Nonetheless such supplementary appropriation, plus the already appropriated N348bn for fuel subsidy this year, would, invariably increase the initial projected 2018 deficit beyond N1.9Tn to almost N2.5Tn, to definitely compound an oppressive debt service burden, which already gulps over 40% of aggregate revenue, annually. Furthermore, INEC\u2019s seemingly bloated bill of N242bn, is also rather worrisome, as it is clearly the largest nominal election budget ever, especially when, population may have only increased marginally, since barely N93bn was the total election expenditure in 2015. Clearly, population increase alone, may not explain the huge spike in the 2019 election budget; furthermore the procurement of multiple-use basic hardware, for technology driven elections, with individual data capture, card readers and other modern electronic facilitators, were apparently fairly adequately provided for the 2015 elections. Besides, there is still also, no available public disclosure of details of the disbursement of the N2.029Tn capital allocation for 2017; although, Finance Minister, Kemi Adeosun, reported that only N1.49Tn has so far, been spent, from last year\u2019s capital budget, there is no official confirmation as to what happened to the balance of N538bn! Furthermore, there is also no official confirmation that the \u2018unspent\u2019 budget was carried over to supplement the 2018 budget; so where is the balance? It would be expected that, rather than compounding the subsisting N1.9Tn budget deficit, with additional loans, in order to presently fund the 2019 elections, surely, the unutilized balance of N538bn from 2017 Capital budget, could still be captured and appropriated as supplementary to the 2018 budget, without the need for more borrowing. Besides, with barely 4 months to December 31st 2018, it is highly unlikely that the 2018 N2.87Tn allocation for Capital expenditure will be totally utilized; as usual, the unspent allocations, will be carried forward without due diligence, only to probably disappear, once a fresh Capital vote is approved for the incoming year. Instructively, despite the reality that the present fiscal process, clearly challenges full implementation of Capital budgets, the funding of infrastructure however, with expensive government loans is clearly disturbing. Regrettably, this macabre budgeting process has so inebriated our fiscal plans, such that, very little can be identified, on ground, as product of the Trillions of Naira, allocated to elevate social infrastructure in recent years. This regrettable self-serving pattern of funding infrastructure with, inappropriately high cost government borrowing, even when free funds could be garnered for the same purpose, is equally worrisome. Expectedly, adroit financial management would rustle feathers amongst the freeloaders, primarily, in the Banking sector, the National Assembly, the Federal Executive and possibly most MDAs, where the return of unspent budget is possibly a rarity. Nonetheless, this underlying reality of a loose fiscal process, is probably best captured in the application of the so called Government\u2019s Excess Crude Account. The noticeable practice is that the budget price benchmark for crude export, is always deliberately well underestimated. Consequently, the surplus revenue, from sales above the budget price, is often conscripted into a contraption called an \u201cExcess Crude Account (ECA)\u201d. Best practice financial management recommends, that fortuitous surplus revenue above budget benchmark should be applied to fund or reduce any deficit earlier projected in each year\u2019s fiscal plan. Regrettably, this is never the case, as government invariably, still proceeds, to borrow, regardless of the attendant, inappropriately high interest rates, in order to fund any budget deficit, earlier deliberately predicated on very conservative oil price benchmark. Consequently, significantly higher actual crude price and related revenue have, never stopped, Nigeria\u2019s Debt Management Office, from religiously borrowing, to fund annual deficits, even when the surplus\u2019 funds garnered from fortuitously higher crude price and output would have reduced or eliminated such borrowing. Inexplicably, nonetheless, even after loans have been taken to fund these deliberately projected deficits, the \u2018surplus\u2019 funds consolidated from higher than budget benchmark oil price, is often shared amongst the tiers government, without any overt approval by the National Assembly as constitutionally required. Ultimately, CBN would also proceed to substitute the higher foreign revenue, with Naira allocations, at a pre-determined rate before allocation to government and its agencies. There is no gain saying that if revenue above budget expectation was used to fund these deficits earlier projected, obviously Nigeria\u2019s loan burden would recede; unfortunately, this has never been the case; sadly, nothing has changed in Budget 2018, as loans will still be consciously accumulated by government to fund the budget, even when oil prices, presently hover nearer $70/barrel, to provide surplus revenue above budget projections, in place of the projected shortfall related to the adoption of $45/barrel budget price for crude oil.

        "author": "None",
        "text": "NIGERIANS habitually look forward to the budget process with much expectation that \u2018things\u2019 will become \u201cbetter\u201d, once the annual budget is passed and duly implemented. Regrettably, however, Nigeria\u2019s fiscal plans, do not become law until, well into each accounting year; consequently, comprehensive implementation of capital projects, within the budget year, becomes a serious challenge; ultimately, projects may be abandoned, while funds allocated also become difficult to account for. Hereafter, some salient aspects of the 2018 Appropriation bill will be addressed in the following interview format: Buhari presenting 2018 budget to joint NASS session In what way is the 2018 budget different from earlier fiscal plans that failed to stimulate inclusive growth? The 2018 Appropriation bill is nominally, Nigeria\u2019s highest ever annual fiscal plan; in real value terms, however the N8.66Tn budget may not be worth more than the 2011 budget of N4.48Tn when Naira was N150=$1. Nonetheless, apart from size, the 2018 budget structure is actually, the standard template adopted for decades; for example, despite reports of copious house cleaning and the benefit of over N20bn monthly savings from deletion of ghost salaries and other allegedly, plugged revenue leakages, and reported refunds and seizures of stolen public funds, etc, recurrent consumption still accounts for about 70% of total annual expenditure. Furthermore, the 2018 budget, is, similarly, also predicated on deficit financing; thus, in the absence of savings, government will continue to borrow, so that it can spend more than its actual earnings; the current Appropriation bill is inexplicably also, similarly silent, on the often unbudgeted and unauthorized allocations to subsidize present petrol price of N142/litre. Although the 2018 budget was laid marginally earlier this year, it will nonetheless still fail, to align and synchronize capital budget implementation with the institutionalized January-December calendar year. Sadly, with up to 4 months unforced delay in budget passage, capital budget implementation will once again, become hurriedly compressed into less than 9 months, to invariably, jeopardize accountability in the ultimate use of funds, and in project quality. Shouldn\u2019t the highest ever budget of N8.66Tn for 2018 inspire hope that the economy will be well funded and social welfare should improve? Unfortunately, there is the popular misconception that bigger budgets should translate into better chances of poverty reductions. But in reality, this has not been so; clearly, the incremental budget process has steadily bloated annual budgets, from less than 2Tn in 2008 to N7.28Tn in 2017, with no meaningful positive social impact. Besides, in real terms the 2011 budget of N4.48Tn (when Naira was N150 =$1) is probably more in real value than the much higher N8.66Tn in 2018, when Naira exchange for above N305-60 =$1. So, we must not be fooled by quantum leaps in budget spending, as this is inevitable, if inflation remains in higher single digits, and if CBN continues to bet against its own currency, with its regular auctions of dollars against Naira. In view of the much reduced export income from crude oil, isn\u2019t it expedient that government should borrow heavily to fund the budget deficit? Yes, you borrow, if you can, when it is expedient, but you must sensibly hesitate to increase your indebtedness, if you already require up to 50% of your total actual income to service existing debts. Any advice to step up borrowing in such circumstances, should be seen as enemy action, particularly when, there is barely any tangible impact from the application of earlier loans. Expectedly, the N1.699Tn projected 2018 deficit, will propel an already oppressive national debt, beyond $70bn to further compel larger allocations of scarce revenue for debt service in latter years; ultimately, Nigeria will be unsustainably locked into more borrowing, to service increasing debt obligations every year hereafter. The non availability of cheaper funds locally seems to have encouraged Mr. President\u2019s preference for a 60% shift to foreign loans. However, in addition to the current bid to borrow $3bn externally, will Government borrow more externally to fund the 2018 budget? The Finance Minster has also clearly expressed preference for foreign loans, because she believes they cost lower with rates around 7%. However, it would probably be more responsible for the Minister to carefully interrogate, why cost of funds remain in higher double digits in her own country, so as to also bring Nigeria\u2019s borrowings in line with best practice rates, where sensible governments generally pay well below 2% on their loans. Ironically, the Minister has suggested that we could even save up to (N91.65bn) from the present loan request for $3bn before parliament! In reality, foreign loans, over which government has no control, can ultimately expose us to forcible manipulation by economic imperialists, who will, as usually, demand their pound of flesh. Besides, Nigerians should also demand a sensible explanation why government borrows dollars externally at 7%, when our own CBN sits comfortably on billions of dollars, which it sells to banks and liberally allocates to BDCs, while it also compulsively borrows to mop and sterilise excess Naira liquidity from the market with inappropriately interest rates, when the productive private sector is clearly denied access to cheaper funds. Nigerians, should be concerned that if Naira rate tumbled from below N100 to N305 since 1998, a Naira rate beyond N1000/$1 is clearly also feasible, if the perennial, systemic challenge of surplus Naira liquidity continues to be compounded with CBN\u2019s dollar auctions. How do you rate some of the sectoral allocations? It seems Power, Works and Housing, have the largest share of N555.88bn I have long given up using the size of sectoral allocations as an index of development expectations. It doesn\u2019t work like that, because when hundreds of billions are reported to be allocated annually to various MDAs, you still never see the difference, that the bigger allocations make! However, the sum of N555.88bn ($1.5bn) for Housing, Works and Power is clearly inadequate for these three critical sectors; for example, power alone, according to sectoral experts, requires over $100bn to stabilize supply. The reality of course, is that it is not often recognized that government capital spending will always remain marginal, in value, in relation to the expanded funding requirements in major sectors like Aviation, Shipping, Railways, and Refineries etc. The truth is that it is private sector activities, that actually drive successful economies; for this reason, availability of funds for private sector investments is invariably infinitely elastic, if the right government policies prevail. Consequently, it is rather inexplicable that government does not appear fully committed to concession as a way of remediating our infrastructural deficit, nor is there any commitment to UNESCO\u2019s recommendation for Education to be allocated over 25% of total expenditure.

        "text": "By Henry Boyo THE National Assembly on May 16, enacted a federal budget of N9.12tn. The increase by N508bn on the N8.612tn budget, earlier presented to the legislature in November 2017, by President Mohammadu Buhari, was reportedly agreed with the Federal Executive, after crude oil benchmark was reviewed from $45 to $51/barrel, as export price steadily rose above $75/barrel. Buhari presenting 2018 budget to joint NASS session Consequently, the Federal government will now spend N2.2tn for servicing its debts, while recurrent and capital expenditure will receive N3.515tn and N2.869Tn respectively in 2018. Incidentally, if the controversial expenditure of $496m (N151bn) for US Tucano Jets and annual fuel subsidy payments, often in excess of N1tn, were also captured, the actual deficit may well exceed N3tn($9bn) i.e. over a third of total expenditure! Ironically, the N2.2tn plus deficit will invariably still compel additional borrowing, which will compound Nigeria\u2019s already unsustainable debt burden. Regrettably, however, additional revenue from higher than crude price benchmark, may not as usual, be applied to reducing the deficit. Instructively, our inexplicable compulsion to borrow despite the oppressive rates, to fund \u201cmischievously\u201d projected annual deficits, has never been restrained even when rising crude prices, unexpectedly consolidate revenue windfalls, which could significantly reduce projected deficits and the need for additional borrowing. The above title was first published in November 2017. Hereafter, some salient aspects of President Buhari\u2019s initial 2018 Appropriation bill will be addressed in the following interrogative prose. Notably, the N508bn increase in the fiscal plan does not significantly affect the observations in that article as the earlier projected deficit of N2.005tn will be reduced by just N50bn. Please read on. In what way is the 2018 budget different from earlier fiscal plans that failed to stimulate inclusive growth? Notably, apart from size, the 2018 budget structure is actually, the standard template adopted for decades; for example, despite reports of copious house cleaning and the additional benefit of over N20bn monthly savings from deletion of ghost workers\u2019 salaries and the reported, plugging of revenue leakages, with several refunds and seizures of stolen public funds, etc, regrettably, recurrent consumption still accounts for over 70% of 2018 budget.

        "text": "By Owei Lakemfa TENS of millions of Nigerians are in dire need. They do not know where the next meal will come from. They are not lazy, but there are no jobs. So when two industrial giants in a largely deindustrialised country take on each other in a fratricidal war, the death knell is sounded for thousands of jobs and their linkages. This unfolding tragedy is just a few days to the end of the year. This will doubtlessly be followed by hunger for the victims and their dependents. BUA International Limited is a producer of foods including sugar, rice, pasta, flour and edible oils. Its tentacles extend to steel, real estate, ports, terminals and cement. Some years ago, it acquired the Sokoto and Edo Cement companies. In the case of the latter, BUA injected US$500 million for a 2.5 million new production line which will bring its production to 2.9 million metric tons. But its production is being halted in a bruising fight with another cement giant, Dangote Cement which has three plants in the country and is expanding into thirteen other African countries. Dangote accused BUA of illegal mining. It claimed to have an April 27, 2016 injunction seeking to restrain BUA from further mining in the area. It claims ownership of the sites in Obu, Okpella. Its ownership rights, it claims, are based on its acquisition of its predecessor company, Ado Ibrahim and Company, AICO. Dangote claims that the lease granted BUA by the Edo State Governor is null and void as only the Federal Government can grant such licence. On its part, BUA claims that Dangote is a predatory company which like the vulture, is feeding on carcasses and engaging in underhand dealings. It said that the recent claims against it: \u201c \u2026by Dangote Group stinks of desperation in its continued attempt to disregard the judicial process and scheme a viable competitor out of business as has been their legendary antecedent.\u201d BUA claims that it has been operating the mines since 1976 when it was known as the Bendel Cement Company. It claims to have its own court ruling which directed that the status quo ante (which recognises its operations) should be maintained. However, Edo State Governor Obaseki announced that the Federal Ministry has asked that the disputed mines be shut-down. So he directed security agents to ensure the closure in order to maintain security. In the midst of all these, walked in a delegation of the host community with the wisdom of Solomon. The people are beneficiaries of the mining and are aware that poverty will increase with the closure. They know that when two elephants fight, it is primarily they, the grass, that will suffer. They proposed that rather than stop work, both BUA and Dangote can mine in the area. They told Governor Obaseki a truth; that the court process he wants to resolve the dispute can take eternity, and in any case, it would only produce a winner and a loser. They want an Alternative Dispute Resolution mechanism that will not only save jobs but increase them, and ensure a win-win outcome for all. This is wisdom springing from a community, and hopefully, the federal and state governments will soak themselves in it. However, as things stand, the mine is being closed, jobs are slipping away and many of the workers and ancillary beneficiaries in the EDO BUA may enter 2018 without an income. That is how tough it has become to be a Nigerian; the struggle for survival is intense. The Year 2018 is so near, yet so far. There are likely to be Nigerians who would be kidnapped from their homes for ransom. When I was young, in almost all cases, those kidnapped were children who can be enticed with sweets and free food. Now the targets are adults who can pay or whose families can pay ransom. Sometimes, even when ransom is paid, the victim is murdered. Nigerians are kidnapped anywhere; on the road, at work, in farms, leisure spots and in their homes. Also, the preferred currency of ransom for the major players in the kidnap industry, is the dollar. With the rise of such crimes as kidnapping, trafficking in drugs and human beings, armed robbery is no longer an issue. Unless it is on a big scale like holding up a number of banks, it goes virtually unreported. I recall the first time I came across a thief; the man rifled past me as if the devil was on his heels, shortly after, a policeman followed and all around me concluded that luck had ran out for the thief. Once the police was on his trail, he had no chance of escape. In those days, thieves operate mainly in the dead of the night and any alarm raised, led to their scampering away. But we are now in the nuclear age where robbers can write letters to whole streets or a neigbourhood giving notice that they would be the victims of their operation on a particular day. The challenges we face as Nigerians include a brutal terror war unleashed by the Boko Haram who hardly take prisoners. There are the quite bloody \u2018Herdsmen-Farmers\u2019 clashes across the country in which sometimes, whole villages are sacked. Despite the massacres, I do not know of people undergoing trial for these grisly crimes against humanity. As the Christmas and New Year holidays set in, we are not sure of power supply. The electricity companies are gods that demand excessive payments through crazy bills, refuse to supply meters, especially pre-paid ones, and to which over N1.3 trillion public funds have been paid as sacrifice. Yet, they are insatiable. Now we face new challenges; unending fuel shortages that has made travelling during this festive period, a nightmare. If we have a fundamental right to movement, and there is no fuel in our vehicles, how do we exercise such a right? During the three-year Civil War (1967-70), life was so brutish and short that people behind rebel lines learnt to live one day at a time. Death stalked the land, kwashiorkor reigned just as bombs did. There was so much uncertainty that people greeted themselves \u201cHappy survival.\u201d When 2018 comes, let us thank God we survived. I wish you happy survival. Related",

        "title": "2018: The year politicians killed Nigerian democracy",
        "author": "Kabiru Muhammad Gwangwazo",
        "text": "By Kabiru Muhammad Gwangwazo Forty years after moves towards the first decisive return to civilian governance began, we are again working to another epochal phase for Nigerian democracy this Gregorian Year, 2018. President Buhari presenting the Party Flag to Osun APC Gubernatorial Candidate Gboyega Oyetola accompanied by other party leaders during the Grand Finale of APC Gubernatorial Campaign Rally in Osun State on 18th Sep 2018 It is obvious we are again at a make-or-break event for civilian democracy ahead of the 2019 election and handover to the next set of rulers. Yes, Rulers, certainly not Leaders. Late Danmasanin Kano, Yusuf Maitama Sule had always prayed that we be blessed with Leaders, not Rulers and I add not Looters, throughout his life as a frontline politician. That political parties including General Buhari\u2019s APC have posted tens of millions of naira as fees for tickets confirms this. That other parties also took their cue from the ruling APC is a disaster for civilian democracy. That signals democracy has finally been deliberately killed by our reigning politicians and political parties. In 1978 when Nigeria was on its way to the Second Republic and political parties surfaced after 16 years of military rule, in every state there were two prominent parties, the dominant state party and the opposition. There were five political parties registered by the Obasanjo/Yar\u2019adua government. They were NPN, PRP, NPP, UPN, GNPP and later NAP in 1983. All of these political parties were fully funded by members and supporters who believed in the cause of the parties, with reasonable support of the federal election agency, FEDECO. Awolowo\u2019s UPN was a natural continuation of the Action Group (AG) of the First Republic with its roots in Egbe Omo-Oduduwa, the Yoruba socio cultural group that Awo led to promote and protect the interests of Yorubas from colonial times. Dr. Azikiwe\u2019s NPP was an offshoot of NCNC and a mixture of minority groups of the same First Republic, including BYM (Borno Youth Movement) that was brought into the mix by Waziri Ibrahim, a multimillionaire and friend of the Nigerian military establishment. After disagreements with Zik and his team in NPP, Waziri broke away to revive his group and lead it to victory as GNPP getting to form the governments of the defunct states of Borno and Gongola. PRP too was born as a result of irreconcilable differences that Malam Aminu Kano had with the core group with which he had earlier led the formation of the NPN from the National Movement that was set up at the end of the Constitutional Conferences of the Obasanjo/Yaradua regime. The NPN, being a natural continuation of Sardauna Ahmadu Bello\u2019s rightist NPC (Northern Peoples Congress) had no place for Malam Aminu Kano who was the major thorn in the flesh of the Northern establishment and its colonial patrons before we got our flag independence in 1960. Malam Aminu Kano was the leader of radical NEPU and went on to become a Federal minister under General Gowon as Head of State. In those days of the First and Second Republics, the conservative and radical progressives all worked with a mission and agenda. None of the parties on whatever side of the spectrum was in politics simply to take over power for personal self aggrandisement of the political players. They ran what amounts to textbook politics in terms of cleanliness, especially compared to the atrocious pillage witnessed in the latest turn of political events in Nigeria. Politics, before the military decided to join and use it to perpetuate themselves in power was simply about service. Money in political parties and campaigns was not the most important of assets. It was a necessary adjunct, yes. But it was not the thing. From the days of self styled (Military) President Ibrahim Babangida (IBB) with his convoluted transition to civil rule, everything changed. Even with his halfhearted attempt at support for NRC and SDP, the two left and right of centre creations he foisted on hapless Nigerians, the insertion of his boys and encouragement of so-called \u201cnew breed\u201d was a disaster that literally destroyed the purpose of civilian democracy. It was in IBB\u2019s transition to nowhere that such larger-than-life moneybag \u201cpoliticians\u201d as Late General Shehu Musa Yar\u2019adua came onto the scene. So too, IBB\u2019s bosom pal, billionaire MKO Abiola who became the last straw that forced his friend, IBB to \u201cstep aside\u201d to his Minna Hilltop Palace. With General Abacha\u2019s transition planned to make him life President, of CNC, DPN, GDM, NCPN and UNCP the final nail appeared to have been punched onto the coffin of civilian democracy. Then God intervened in 1998. Abacha died. Another General, Abdulsalami Abubakar took over. Military rule had by then become universally unfashionable. Thus, General Obasanjo caught in a coup attempt against fellow General, Sani Abacha and jailed for his crime was sprung from jail by his military boys and forced on Nigerians as appeasement for the June 12 MKO SDP and Tofa NRC elections they cancelled. We then suffered eight years of a contrived civil rule under Obasanjo and went on to suffer General Shehu Yar\u2019Adua\u2019s younger brother, terminally sick Umaru Yar\u2019adua who expectedly died in office. And then the bumbling incompetence of another military propped President, Jonathan of fresh air, all under PDP. As we mark 20 years since the first set of elections in 1999, we are still under the thumb of the military with General Muhammadu Buhari (GMB), another former militay head of state as President. He was brought in as a credible alternative to Obasanjo\u2019s high-handedness and Jonathan\u2019s bumbling times. The key selling point of General Buhari is his integrity, in particular his impeccable credentials over his years of service as a military officer and military politician. Cumulatively Nigerian democracy has been rubbished by militarisation of the polity, the forced migration to a centralised pseudo-federal presidential System; a system that is more unitary than federal in all respects in tune with the military\u2019s tradition of centralised command. The system has consistently favoured money and moneybags. With the election of GMB as President the many assumptions of Change have remained largely unfulfilled. The excuse given by many of us, traditional GMB supporters have to do with the fact of his health challenges for most of the first term. Yet, with the upcoming 2019 elections in view and preparations in top gear within political parties, it is apparent that though thankfully heathy, GMB has not measured up to his rating. He has sadly allowed those who never had any integrity to lose in the first place to toy with his choice asset, and allowed them free rein on decisions that impact on his political future and his place in Nigeria\u2019s history. Though acting appropriately even if late on some of these infractions, the GMB Government allowed the DSS run on the National Assembly, the fake (NYSC) certificate of Kemi Adeosun, his finance minister, the alleged fake certificate of his legal assistant; the open and warm reception and embrace of Senator Akpabio, ex-PDP to the General\u2019s APC and many of his type all over the land. As if that is not enough, the President\u2019s party, APC led the 91 registered political parties in posting the most outrageous fees ever for aspirants wanting to contest elections. Our President \u201cbought\u201d his forms for N45 million, paid for by some supporters. Scandalously. This so soon ignores that in 2014, the General had to seek a bank loan to pay N27 million we all found unfair and outrageous. Yet, as chief stakeholder, guardian and guide of the nation our GMB meekly accepted the supporters\u2019 gift of a N45 million ticket he could have outrightly rejected and thus forced the parties and politicians back to the path of rectitude. Failing that, now all parties took their cue appropriately. All charge huge sums. All expect aspirants to become candidates and win elections and genuinely serve the people. How can that happen, ever? Related",

        "title": "2019 already in play in APC",
        "author": "Ochereome Nnanna",
        "text": "By Ochereome Nnanna While the various political elements that formed the victorious coalition, the All Progressives Congress, APC, gathered against the former ruling Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, pundits had believed it was only a matter of time before the gang-up would come unstuck. However, the various constituents surprised everyone, sank their differences and worked together to ensure the ouster of ex-President Goodluck Jonathan, with Muhammadu Buhari as the arrowhead of the grand coalition of the old North and the ruling political mainstream of South West. They were not expected to push through the threshold of beating a ruling behemoth like the PDP, but luck was on their side because Jonathan proved incapable of holding his party and government together to achieve a successful re-election. But now that the APC is sitting pretty in the saddle, it is obvious that the litmus test for it as a ruling party is still in play. Two things will further challenge its viability as a ruling coalition that can stand the test of time. Number one is power sharing among the various political interest groups. Number two is the hot-button games towards 2019. Let us pause and ruminate over a few issues. People always say it is ideal to allow members of the National Assembly to choose their own leaders rather than allow \u201cexternal influences\u201d to \u201cimpose\u201d leaders on the Distinguished Senators and Honourable Members. Before 2011 when the Seventh National Assembly was empanelled to work alongside the Jonathan presidency, the \u201cexternal influence\u201d that was obvious to all was the Presidency. During the eight years of Olusegun Obasanjo in the Presidency, he brazenly sought to dictate who emerged as the President of the Senate and Speaker of the House of Representatives. He used every \u201cstick-and-carrot\u201d trick in the book to get his preferred candidates in, and when they outlived their usefulness, get them bundled out. In one of the scandalous sessions, the Ghana-Must-Go bagfuls of raw cash he allegedly sent to bribe members of the House of Representatives to remove Hon Umar Ghali Na\u2019Abba were displayed on the floor of the Green Chamber. But in 2011, Jonathan tried to do what the APC just attempted and met a disastrous defeat. He wanted to put Hon Mulikat Akande in office as the Speaker of the House to complete the zoning formula of his Party and give every geopolitical zone a share of the spoils of PDP\u2019s victory at the polls. But a new \u201cexternal influence\u201d popped up from an unusual quarter and made total nonsense of the PDP zoning formula. Asiwaju Ahmed Bola Tinubu was in ascendancy as a powerful opposition leader. He went into the throng of PDP members-elect and sponsored Hon Aminu Waziri Tambuwal (who brought in Hon Emeka Ihedioha as his Deputy) to beat Akande to implant a rebel leadership in the House of Reps. Tambuwal eventually led the revolt against the PDP from inside the House. It was a masterstroke that helped Tinubu to midwife a successful takeover of power at the centre later on. Surprisingly, on June 9, 2015, Tinubu and the APC fell into the same trap that he had set for Jonathan and the PDP in 2011. The number of \u201cexternal influences\u201d increased. While the President, Muhammadu Buhari, appeared to have learnt from the humiliation of Jonathan in 2011 and announced early enough that he would not interfere in the choice of the Senate and House leadership, Tinubu staged a Tony Anenih-like internal primary election that worked towards a predetermined result in an attempt to impose his chosen candidates: Ahmed Lawan for the Senate President and Femi Gbajabiamila for Speaker of the House of Representatives. If he had been allowed to successfully close that deal, he would have entrenched himself in the National Assembly. By so doing, he would have further edged out other stakeholders in the ruling coalition, including elements of the All Nigerian Peoples Party, ANPP, Rochas Okorocha\u2019s interests and most importantly, the \u201cnew\u201d PDP faction. In fact, the interests of Buhari\u2019s old Congress for Progressive Change, CPC, would have been subsumed under an accreting Tinubu\u2019s Action Congress of Nigeria, ACN, faction. This was what prompted the vehemence with which the nPDP faction fought back and defeated Tinubu. We now saw former Vice President Atiku Abubakar, Governor Tambuwal of Sokoto State, Governor Okorocha of Imo State and others closing ranks with Senator Rabiu Kwankwaso, Aliyu Wamakko and the rest of them. They went as far as colluding with the opposition PDP, to which they conceded the Deputy Senate President in efforts to put in their colleagues, former Governor Bukola Saraki, as the new Senate President, and Hon Yakubu Dogara as the Speaker, House of Reps. The stage is set for a season of heated struggle for the control of the APC. It is no longer going to be an all-Tinubu affair. He alone is no longer going to be \u201cthe Party\u201d. If he and his lackeys in charge of the machinery of the Party push to make good their threat of sanctioning the \u201csaboteurs\u201d who committed the \u201ctreachery\u201d against \u201cthe Party\u201d, they will have a humongous fight in their hands. Tinubu will be ranged against the PDP faction composed of tested Northern political hotheads who see him as nothing but a mere upstart local champion (refer to how Saraki referred to Vice President Yemi Osinbajo as a \u201cmere commissioner\u201d). Unless the fallouts of the National Assembly polls are wisely managed and the interests of all the coalition partners subsequently factored into all the power sharing activities of the party, we may eventually witness any of several interesting scenarios. One may be that Tinubu, with the support of Buhari, could eventually triumph over the nPDP and other rebels and push them to either return to PDP for 2019, or form another, third political party to challenge for power. The second could be that Tinubu may be defeated by a realigned coalition of the North with South East and South-South, along with their PDP stalwarts from the South West. In that case, Tinubu might be forced to go solo again with his ACN faction. The truth is that the power play towards 2019 is in full swing. The virility of the APC coalition, as currently constituted, will be sorely tested in a series of face-offs and standoffs for control. The North is going to be very assertive. They are now in power, with 17 compared to Tinubu\u2019s five states. In fact, Tinubu has very little control over Edo State APC and its local leader, Governor Adams Oshiomhole. When it comes to the crunch Oshiomhole can pick and choose where he wants to pitch his interest, bearing in mind that so far, Tinubu\u2019s power sharing efforts has not factored him in. Tinubu\u2019s staying power in the Party will hang, in the main, on his continued good relationship with President Buhari. And to remain in the President\u2019s good books and be welcome among the Northern hawks around him, Tinubu will have to increasingly and openly concede the fact that, though the APC has \u201cmany leaders\u201d as Alhaji Lai Mohammed naively put it, PMB is the supreme leader of the Party. It is from PMB\u2019s continued gracious approval that Tinubu will sustain his position as the National Leader of the APC. Related",

        "author": "Mazi Sam-Ohuabunwa",
        "text": "By Mazi Sam-Ohuabunwa LAST week, President Muhammadu Buhari, PMB, began the last lap in the four year term given to him by the people of Nigeria to lead the nation. Though PMB has expressed a wish to have his mandate renewed, no one can be sure if this request will be granted, until after the presidential elections in February or March next year (depending on which schedule will rule \u2013 INEC or NASS) and hoping that all things remain equal. You may ask me what I mean by \u201call things remain equal.\u201d I have read resolutions by some ethnic nationality groups insisting that Nigeria must be restructured or there may be no elections. In view of the fact that no one knows if the restructuring will take place on one hand and the fact that nobody knows whether the ethnic nationalities can carry out their threat on the other hand, that\u2019s what I mean by \u201call things being equal.\u201d Nevertheless, the chances of granting PMB\u2019s request will certainly depend on what he does or what he does not do in this last lap. Watching recent heightened level of activities within the polity, I get the sense that PMB and his team have realized that if the elections were held this moment, his chances are not as bright as they were in 2015. Never mind the huge political crowds in Kano or Yobe. Every Nigerian knows that political crowd is commodity in Nigeria, in addition to the fact that it will require votes from both the North and South, East and West for the mandate to be renewed. And it does not matter if one region gives 97 per cent, we will still need the five per cent to make up 100 per cent (a la PMB\u2019s arithmetical formula) In the last few weeks, Lai Mohammed, Babatunde Raji Fashola, Chibuike Rotimi Amaechi and some of the other ministers in PMB\u2019s cabinet have been crisscrossing the nation inspecting road and rail projects and drawing attention to the infrastructural exploits of this administration. P ress conferences were being held in Abuja and in Lagos and on the democracy day, May 29, PMB took time to list the achievements of his administration in the last three years and was kind of beating his chest and expecting the applause of Nigerians. Of course, some members of APC who have benefitted from the administration applauded, while some other segments like the nPDP were busy complaining that they have not received any \u201creturn\u201d on their \u201chuge investments\u201d in the party and PMB\u2019s victory in 2015. Many other Nigerians comprising the growing army of the unemployed, the bereaved from the unmitigated onslaught from the militant Fulani herdsmen and sundry marauders, the traumatized and dispossessed farmers, internal refugees in the IDP camps and many hungry could not applaud. PMB has asked Nigerians to judge him on three issues: the economy, security and anti-corruption. Certainly on the three key issues, we are not where we should be, based on the promises made to the people of Nigeria. Though the economy is in the recovery mode (1.9 per cent GDP growth in QI), it is still performing below the May 29, 2015 levels in all ramifications. What is most frightening is that Unemployment has doubled over the period from about nine per cent to 18% as at end of Q1 2018. And we are not talking of making the Nigerian Naira equal to one US dollar. I have long convinced my wife not to hold this against PMB, which is one of the promises she has eagerly awaited its fulfillment. Nigeria today is the 6th most economically miserable country in the World. On security, the success achieved against Bokoharam insurgency in the North East has been fully eroded by the Militant herdsmen onslaught mostly in the Middle Belt. Nigeria is currently rated one of the most unsafe places on the planet Earth . On anti-corruption, PMB seems frustrated that despite all the noise, dance and drama, Nigeria\u2019 position on the transparency International Corruption Perception Index (CPI ) has worsened in the latest ranking. What is worse, not much convictions have been obtained on those charged to court regarding PDP\u2019s 2015 campaign funding. It, therefore, looks to me that PMB has mounted a renewed offensive in this area putting pressure on both EFCC and the Judiciary. The decision of Justice Abang to go ahead with the case against Olisa Metuh, whether he is alive or dead sign posts the present desperation to get convictions by all means. In one week alone, several former office holders who belong to the PDP were arraigned in courts in what looked like a major joint campaign by the EFCC and the judiciary. Former Governor of Kano State and former Minister of Education, Ibrahim Shekarau, Ambassador Aminu Wali and the campaign director of former President Goodluck Jonathan, Mansur Ahmad, former deputy governor of Sokoto State and Minister of Water Resources, Mukhtari Shagari, Ibrahim Gidado, a former commissioner, PDP State chairman, Ibrahim Milgoma, PDP Treasurer, Nasiru Dalhatu as well as the State PDP governorship candidate in the state in the 2015 election, Abdallah Wali were all charged to court in an unprecedented blitz of arraignments. Others were former governorship candidate in Edo State, Pastor Osagie Ize- Iyamu, state party chairman, Chief Dan Orbih; former deputy governor, Lucky Imaseun, a member representing Esan South East and Esan North East in the House of Representatives, Tony Azegbemi, and Mr Efe Anthony. Meanwhile, former Governor of Plateau State and a serving Senator, Jonah Jang was recently arraigned in Jos and former governor of Kaduna State-Mukhtar Ramalan Yero is set to be arraigned soon on corruption charges. One would have applauded this renewed onslaught if not that it is patently one sided and absolutely partisan. No member of APC is on the list including members of the nPDP or politicians who have decamped from PDP to APC. Therefore, many people including international observers see this as essentially a political strategy to discomfiture the opposition, to keep them distracted and occupied with defending themselves in court and thereby whittling down their energy and resources to oppose APC in the forthcoming elections. I am personally saddened by this apparent clampdown and harassment of the opposition which actually makes a mockery of the anticorruption fight. Whether this strategy will work in improving Nigeria\u2019s ranking on the CPI is yet to be seen and whether it will help to make Nigeria less corrupt may be determined perhaps after PMB\u2019s tenure or when another Party comes to power and follows in this footstep of covering own sins and exposing the opposition\u2019s sins. Whatever may be the case, it is clear that what actions PMB takes in this last lap will either make or mar his chances in 2019. It is essentially up to him. Related",

        "author": "Rose Moses",
        "text": "By Rose Moses Going by the popular quote attributed to French philosopher, Joseph de Maistre: \u2018Toute nation a le gouvernement qu\u2019elle m\u00e9rite,\u2019 but translated in English in several variables, including \u201cEvery country has the government it deserves\u201d and \u201cIn a democracy, people get the leaders they deserve,\u201d politicians alone should not be blamed for present day Nigeria\u2019s woes. Obasanjo If a\u201dnation\u201d is to be understood as \u201cthe people,\u201d it would therefore mean that people choose governments in democracies. Like his first coming in 1984, though under the military via a coup, President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s emergence in 2015 as an elected president was welcomed with unprecedented enthusiasm by the people. Many accepted his government and saw in him the expected messiah after what they termed 16 years of wasteful leadership by the PDP. They had looked forward to progressive changes for the better. But students of history never forget. They saw through the thick and over-size credibility garb Buhari was adorned in while his candidacy was being sold. The saying that a leopard can never change its spot, therefore, resonated in many places and actually earned for those playing the tune names such as \u2018Wailing Wailers,\u2019 \u2018Haters,\u2019 among others by government officials. But that did not deter students of history from maintaining that real reason for the very slow pace of governance in 1984, as also announced by the military boys that plotted the coup that ousted the Buhari administration on August 27, 1985, was mostly due to lack of unanimity of purpose among the then ruling Supreme Military Council (SMC). The concept of collective leadership was said to have been substituted by stubborn and ill-advised unilateral actions that destroyed the principles upon which the government came to power. That government was also accused of directing all its energies at opposition, real or imagined, to the detriment of effective leadership. The result was bad economy, daily increase in inflation, government\u2019s continued distancing of itself from the people, whose yearnings and aspirations were ignored. Uncertainty and stagnation in government became the order of the day, a route that many were unwilling to travel in 2015, the sermon of born-again democrat being preached then, notwithstanding. But alas! those for Buhari had their way, and their way was collectively binding on all. Two years after, going to three, most of the things the Buhari military government was accused of in 1985 as reason for its sacking seem to be staring us on the face. The issue of gross misuse of power has led to the government being viewed in many circles as the biggest disaster in the history of governance in Nigeria. Despite the tendency to heap all blames of its inefficiency on past government, most of Buhari\u2019s initial supporters appear to be seeing differently now. We are not just seeing yellow card, but a red one issued to a government by those that actually installed it. It seems they can no longer remain passive and watch a small group of individuals, known as cabal, misuse power to the detriment of national aspirations and interests. And so, we have a \u2018Third Force,\u2019 a group the Nigeria Intervention Movement (NIM) secretariat in Abuja described as \u201ca pro-democracy movement and pressure group of like-minded Nigerians committed to changing the political order it claims has failed to fashion a Nigeria that works for all. However, almost all members of the group have been part of the system that must have brought us to where we are today. With former President Olusegun Obasanjo now joining the growing number of \u2018wailers\u2019 in the country, the Buhari government obviously, must have frittered away the goodwill it hitherto enjoyed, despite all odds. Which brings to mind another quote by same Joseph de Maistre: \u2018man may well have covered over and, so to speak, encrusted the truth with the errors he has loaded onto it, but these errors are local, and universal truth will always show itself.\u2019 Moving away from mistakes already made and what were said of them, the question now is: How good is a Buhari, with his age, health and style of leadership; perhaps now clearer to all, for Nigeria in 2019? In a strongly worded 13-page statement garnished with allegories, Obasanjo, during the week, declared that Buhari is not the answer in 2019. Although he acknowledges supporting him in the 2015 election, Obasanjo feels differently and disappointed now. In his statement, where he slammed Buhari for turning a blind eye to corruption within his government, his harshest words were actually reserved for what he described as the President\u2019s clannishness, lack of understanding of the dynamics of politics, and his tendencies to pass the buck of his government\u2019s inadequacies to the immediate past administration. In the special press statement he entitled, \u201cThe Way Out: A Clarion Call for Coalition for Nigeria Movement,\u201d Obasanjo is asking Buhari not to re-contest, but instead honourably \u201cdismount from the horse\u201d to join the league of the country\u2019s former leaders, whose \u201cexperience, influence, wisdom and outreach can be deployed on the side line for the good of the country.\u201d Considering that man, as Joseph de Maistre would again say, is insatiable for power; infantile in his desires and, always discontented with what he has, loves only what he has not and therefore despotic in nature, will Buhari heed this counsel?

        "author": "Muyiwa Adetiba",
        "text": "By Muyiwa Adetiba In just about six months, most of the election noises would have quietened. And the country through INEC alone, would be about 150 billion Naira poorer. The noises would shift to the courts where another undisclosed amount would be expended. APC & PDP Senior lawyers and many of the Tribunal Judges are expected to smile all the way to the bank. So would some retired judges and all those who serve as brokers to our skewed justice system. In all, not less than about 250 Billion Naira of Nigeria\u2019s resources\u2014hard earned or not\u2014would have gone for this election. I am including of course, cash for votes and other \u2018financial logistics.\u2019 In the end, nothing fundamental would have changed because nothing fundamental has been rigorously addressed. Barring an upset, General Muhammadu Buhari would be returned. So would over 70% of the incumbents. Very few of them have earned a return because very few of them have positively affected the lives of those under their charge. But then, what are the criteria for a return? There is no standard, no red line, no irreducible minimum below which, an incumbent should be denied. The only standard seems to be the availability of money, however acquired. And the ability to speak with both sides of the mouth. At the end of the exercise, the rich political class\u2014and its fat-cat lawyers\u2014 would have become richer while the rest of us would have become poorer. The infrastructures would remain weak and critical sectors would remain underfunded. We would be overly optimistic if not stupid to expect things to change for the better going forward just because we have gone through another electoral cycle while the system remains as it is. Or to think there is no tipping point to this thoughtless way of running a country. I had hoped\u2014it seems such a waste of emotions now\u2014that a third force would emerge that would throw up some uncomfortable questions about governance in the country. A force that would challenge the status quo not seek to accommodate it. Yes, a third force did come up and some of the names appeared credible. But it compromised itself by aligning with tainted politicians. It wanted power on existing terms, with the existing system. Alas, the third force has not proved to be a force for any fundamental change. It is just, for the members, another route to political power. The \u2018Not too young to run\u2019 group is another sad tale. Having secured the passage of a bill that lowered eligible ages for those aspiring to political positions, it now wanted some tokenism from existing political parties. The problem, dear \u2018Not too young to run\u2019 is in the parties themselves and the systems they operate. And asking for guarantied slots is already a compromise against merit and competence. Macron, Kurz and Trudeau or even Obama and Clinton didn\u2019t just happen. These guys prepared themselves for political leadership over a considerable length of time. And they worked within a system that gave opportunities to ideas, to merit. They were/are at the helm of affairs in their respective countries not because but in spite of age. It is also disconcerting to see how many political neophytes think it is easier to vie for the presidency than to vie for the Senate or House of Rep. It is like hoping to be the CEO of a multinational company without serving some apprenticeship. It is bewildering to see them talk of a preferred destination without considering the vehicle that will take them here. I think the whole attitude belittles the seriousness of the occasion if not the institution of the presidency itself. The issue as I see it is that we are a poor country, our oil resources notwithstanding. It is an issue both the leaders and the led are in denial about but the earlier we faced that fact, the better for us. We are also a nation that has badly managed its resources. I expect new parties or new thinking to address the issue of the economy and how it can work better for all of us. This new thinking should query why we spend colossal sums every four years on election materials. Is it not possible to leverage on available new technology to effect a cheaper and yet more reliable polling system? The present system is archaic and wasteful. It only serves the interest of the current rigging class. I also believe it will be cheaper and less acrimonious to have a fixed term of six years because we will then be having two elections in 12 years instead of three. The reality of our economic situation where we barely have money for capital projects dictates that we cannot afford a bicameral National Assembly. We should choose one. We also cannot afford full time Assembly members at the rate it is causing the nation to sustain them. The amount that goes to the Executive especially Aso Rock is atrocious in the circumstances. The place is unwieldly and unproductive. It is a drain on our purse. The buzz word in town is restructuring. Yet very few of its proponents have come up with specifics so we are left to individual interpretations of the word. It is however clear that a country that spends 90% of its resources to feed 1% of its populace needs to be restructured. A budget where over 70% goes to recurrent expenditure needs to be restructured. A country where the states rely on the centre for sustenance needs to be restructured. A country where state governors have to look to the centre to combat crimes has to be restructured. An economy that does not reward productivity, where consumption tax is distributed from the centre, where those who spend are not those who earn, needs to be restructured. To me, the issue with our country is the economy and our management of it. It is why Nigerians are falling into poverty every day. It is why we have one of the highest infant mortality rates in the world. It is why we have one of the highest out of school children in the world. It is why we have instability in the north-eastern part of the country. It is why youth unemployment rate is this high. The devil is in the system we operate. It is why the political class is the richest class. Anybody aspiring for public office must first acknowledge that we are poor. He must then tell us in graphic details how the economy should be restructured and revamped starting with the political ruling class\u2014after all, charity should start from home. No leader has done that in the 20 years of our most recent democracy. And none during this campaign has promised that. Yet, the real issue is how to free our economy from rampaging vultures. Some of them are on the soap box as we speak. Related",

        "text": "This week I will continue my examination of the reported attempts by the Houses of Assembly of Benue and Imo States to impeach the Governors of the respective states. It is settled principle of law that the Constitution is the supreme law of the land and the failure to follow any of its provisions renders any steps taken unconstitutional, null and void. In HOPE DEMOCRATIC PARTY (HDP) V. MR. PETER OBI & 5 ORS (2011) 12 SC (PT. II) 162, the Supreme Court stated that: \u2018\u2019The Constitution is the supreme law of the land; therefore the provisions are superior to every provision embodied in any Act or law and are binding on all persons and authorities in Nigeria. The failure to follow any of the provisions renders the steps taken unconstitutional, null and void. Such Act must be set aside by the Court.\u201d Supremacy of the legislature The Courts have also held that supremacy of the legislature is subject to the overall supremacy of the Constitution and the legislature must exercise its powers within the limits of the provisions of the CFRN. Please see the case of INDEPENDENT NATIONAL ELECTORAL COMMISSION & ANOR V. BALARABE MUSA & ORS (2003) 1 SCM 62, where it was held that: \u2018\u2019The supremacy of the National Assembly is subject to the overall supremacy of the Constitution. Accordingly, the National Assembly in which the Constitution vest powers cannot go outside or beyond the Constitution. Where a situation arises, the Court will, in an action by the aggrieved party, pronounce the act unconstitutional, null and void.\u201d Placing reliance on the above-cited decisions of the Supreme Court, it is indisputable that the House of Assembly of a State must strictly comply with all listed procedure in Sections 188(1) \u2013 188(9) of the CFRN before it can lawfully and constitutionally remove a person from the office of Governor or Deputy Governor. InINAKOJU & 17 ORS V. ADELEKE & 3 ORS (2007) 1 SC (PT. I) 1 @ PG. 135, LINE 5, it was stated that: \u2018\u2019The provisions of Section 188(1) to (9) must be strictly complied with before a Governor or Deputy Governor can be constitutionally removed from office.\u201d Please also hear his Lordship Ogbuagu, JSC at PG. 222-223 @ LINES 40-15, where his Lordship held that: Seriousness or magnitude of the removal \u2018\u2019It can be seen that the draftsmen, were alert in respect of the seriousness or magnitude of the removal of a Governor or his Deputy. They chose their words and every word in this section or provision, is weighty and material. Therefore, in the removal of such officers, the procedure clearly specified, must be followed and strictly complied with before such removal becomes valid and constitutional. Any breach of any of the said provisions surely and certainly, renders such removal ineffective, null and void and of no effect. It is now settled firstly, that where a statute or Constitution, prescribes a procedure for seeking a remedy or the doing of anything or act and the language used, is clear and unambiguous, (as in the above section) that is the only procedure open to the parties concerned and any departure therefrom, will be an exercise in futility.\u201d It is thus clear that not all the conditions in Section 188(1) \u2013 188(9) of the CFRN have to be breached before the impeachment can be declared unlawful and unconstitutional. A breach of any one of the conditions in Section 188(1) \u2013 188(9) of the CFRN by the House of Assembly of a State is enough to render an impeachment unlawful and unconstitutional. Please see the case of INAKOJU & 17 ORS V. ADELEKE & 3 ORS (SUPRA) @ PG. 83 LINES 1 \u2013 5, where it was held that: Breach of one condition \u2018\u2019I should briefly take the above, not before I make an important point that all the above conditions need not be breached before a Court of law can hold that the procedure is unconstitutional. Breach of one condition is enough.\u2019\u2019 Having shown that the House of Assembly of a State must strictly comply with all the above-listed procedure in Sections 188(1) \u2013 188(9) of the CFRN before it can lawfully and constitutionally remove a person from the office of Governor or Deputy Governor. The pertinent question to ask at this stage is whether or not the actions of the Benue State House of Assembly and Imo State House of Assembly are in strict compliance with Section 188(1) \u2013 188(9) of the CFRN. Whether or not the Benue and Imo State Houses of Assembly followed the proper procedure for impeachment? For the sake of convenience I propose to analyze the respective actions of the Benue and Imo State House of Assembly individually in order to ascertain whether or not the respective State Houses of Assembly followed the procedure under Section 188(1) \u2013 188(9) of the CFRN. BENUE STATE I will refrain from commenting on the legality and civility of the alleged storming of the legislative house with heavily armed policemen and operatives of the Department of State Security (DSS) and just focus on the constitutionality of the notice of allegation executed by the 8 legislators. There are 30 legislators that make up the Benue State House of Assembly. A reading of the above-quoted section of the CFRN makes it clear that the notice of allegation must be signed by not less than one-third of the Benue State House of Assembly. One-third of the members of the Benue State of House of Assembly is 10. Hence by virtue of Section188(2) of the CFRN any notice of allegation must be signed by not less than 10 members of the Benue State House of Assembly. The notice of allegation signed by less than one-third of the members of the Benue State House of Assembly is a gross violation of the provisions of Section188(2) of the CFRN and any lawful/constitutional impeachment cannot be founded on the said notice of allegation. It is settled law that where the law has prescribed a particular method of carrying out a duty only that method must be adopted. Please see the case of C.C.B. (NIG) PLC V. A-G., ANAMBRA STATE (1992) 8 NWLR (PT. 261) 528 @ PG. 556 (PARA G \u2013 H) where the Supreme Court, Per Nmaemeka \u2013 Agu, JSC held that: \u2018\u2019Now, it is the law that where a statue provides for a particular method of performing a duty regulated by statue, that method, and no other, must have to be adopted\u2026\u201d In the case of PHARMA \u2013 DEKO PLC V. F.D.C. LTD. (2015) 10 NWLR (PT. 1467) 225 @ PG. 249 (PARA A), the Court of Appeal held that: \u2018\u2019\u2026For example, once a law has prescribed a particular method of exercising a statutory power any other method of exercise of it is excluded.\u201d Unlawful and unconstitutional procedure The procedure adopted by the 8 legislators in this case is not supported by the provisions of the CFRN. The impeachment proceedings have been kicked off on a totally unlawful and unconstitutional procedure. It is submitted that no subsequent action can cure this fundamental defect. It is settled law that one cannot put something on nothing and expect it to stand. Please see the case of AJI V. CHAD BASIN DEV. AUTHOURITY & ANOR (2015) 3-4 SC (PT. III) 1; HAMZAT V. SANNI (2015) 5 NWLR (PT. 1453) 486; MACFOY V. U.A.C. (1962) AC 158. It is also settled law that where the pre-condition for carrying out an act has not been properly complied with any act subsequent thereto would be invalid, null and void. Please see the case of BEN OBI NWABUEZE V. JUSTICE OBI OKOYE (1988) 10-11 SC 79, where it was held that: \u2018\u2019Where the law prescribes the doing of a thing as a condition for the performance of another, the non-doing of such thing renders the subsequent act void.\u201d Dead on arrival It is my opinion that the notice of allegation signed by less than one-third of the members of the Benue State House of Assembly is unconstitutional. Hence the impeachment proceedings commenced by the said 8 members of the Benue State House of Assembly having been commenced on a procedure other than as stated in the CFRN is dead on arrival. In the case of EKPENYONG V. UMANA (2010) ALL FWLR (PT. 520) 1387 @ PG. 1397, PARAS F-G, Per Ngwuta, JCA (as he then was), his Lordship held that: \u2018\u2019I accept the argument and the authorities to the effect that for the purpose of the issues of jurisdiction, Section 188(1) \u2013 (9) must be read together before it can be determined whether the ouster clause in subsection (10) bars the Court from intervention. For instance, suppose that contrary to Section 188(1), the notice of allegation is supported by 1/5 of the members of the House, this would be a violation of the Constitution itself and the Court would intervene.\u201d The notice of allegation signed by 8 out of the 30 members of the Benue State House of Assembly is unconstitutional. Any impeachment proceedings instituted, continued or concluded on the basis of the said notice of allegation would be unconstitutional, null and void. To be continued. Related",

        "text": "By Yinka Odumakin \u201cHe (Jonathan) rang me and said \u2018Your Excellency,\u2019 and l said, \u2018Your Excellency sir.\u2019 He said \u2018l ring to congratulate you.\u2019 I will not forget the time. He said \u2018l ring to congratulate you that l have conceded defeat, congratulations.\u2019 He said \u2018did you hear me?\u2019 I said \u2018yes sir. Thank you very much for your statesmanship\u2019 because after being a deputy governor, governor, vice president and president for six years, for him to take that decision\u2026 because he could have caused some problems having stayed long enough in his capacity.\u2019-President Muhammadu Buhari,19th January, 2018. THE reticent General Overseer of Redeemed Christian Church of God, RCCG, Pastor Enoch Adeboye delivered some stern warnings at the April edition of the Holy Ghost service last Friday. With the Vice-President Prof. Yemi Osinbajo among his congregation, the man of God called on President Buhari to stop the killings going on across the country as the continuation may imperil 2019 elections and throw the country under the bus. In his words: \u201cI am going to ask you to join me in prayer, because unless these killings stop, and stop immediately, even Nigeria may not live. I am not talking about individuals now, I am talking about Nigeria itself\u2026a bishop asked me not too long ago, \u2018Daddy, has God told you who will win the next election?\u2019 \u201cI said, Sir, I am not even sure yet there will be an election. Because unless these killings stop there may be no elections next year. \u2018Are you prophesying , Daddy?\u2019 No, no! I am not prophesying. I am just reasoning. Because nobody will want to go out to vote if they are not sure they will be able to return home safely,\u201d he explained. A religious war According to him, he has seen war at close quarters and knows that there is nothing good about war, \u201cit\u2019s a terrible thing. A nation may survive a civil war, but no nation can survive a religious war and remain the same. That Nigeria may live, these killings must stop. So all of you who love Nigeria, I want you to rise on your feet, and cry to God with all your heart, and say: Father, let the killings stop\u201d. Pastor Adeboye\u2019s fears are real. Not many countries that are officially at war record the number of deaths we now daily record in our country. And the greatest tragedy unfolding is that the Nigerian authority is yet to show the willingness to put an end to the wanton killings in the country. And to show that expecting the Federal Government to end these killings is like waiting for a marble statue to shed tears, Mr. President during his recent visit to the US told President Trump that the Fulani herdsmen who have been terrorising most sections of the country with AK 47 only carry sticks and machetes. Standing up to truth One of the governors whose state has been at the receiving end of these murderous activities Mr. Darius Ishaku of Taraba has swiftly countered the false narrative when he said \u201cIt\u2019s absolutely wrong for the President to say herdsmen don\u2019t move around with guns. I mean, who then kills who? It couldn\u2019t have been imaginary that people have been killed with AK-47 in the farmers-herdsmen clashes. We simply have to stand up to the truth and do something to stop the killings.\u201d If these killings were to stop by some divine intervention and the 2019 elections takes place, there are other clear and present danger in the land which should worry genuine patriots on our capacity to have a free, fair and peaceful elections. The biggest of our electoral headaches is the temperament of the ruling party the All Progressive Congress, APC, whose government will supervise the elections. If what happened during its ward congresses last Saturday are anything to go by, this country needs all the prayers to survive the 2019 elections as no man can give what he does not have. When the President made the statement I quoted at the opening of this piece in April this year,I remember my brother Eni B pointing out that the faux pas was a warning of what we may face in future elections. Truly,the last sentence in that quote could mean that this those who are in same position presently would not give in so cheaply in similar circumstance. In many parts of the country, last Saturday,the President\u2019s men showed us the \u201cproblems\u201d they are capable of causing having \u201cstayed long \u201d in their \u201ccapacities\u201d. In Rivers State where the Director General of the President\u2019s campaign and Transport Minister,Mr. Rotimi Ameachi comes from recorded death and burning of the party secretariat. A congress of violence In Ondo State, the congress was marred by violence and other irregularities as many members of the party were allegedly prevented from participating in the exercise. The Secretary to the State Government, Mr. Sunday Abegunde, and the Chairman of the National Union of Road Transport Workers, Mr. Jacob Adebo, were fingered in the alleged irregularities. Abegunde and Adebo allegedly led members of the NURTW, to some centres in various wards in Akure South Local Government Area of the state, to chase out some delegates who were not loyal to him. The exercise was postponed in Oyo State after thugs disrupted the congress at the party secretariat in Oke-Ado area of Ibadan, with people sustaining injuries. Trouble started shortly before the exercise began as chairs were thrown at members in the hall during a stakeholders meeting while stones were also thrown into the venue by suspected thugs. The Chairman of the party\u2019s Local Government and Ward Congress Committee, Musa Halilu-Ahmed, said two members of the committee sustained injuries. In Delta State, a Chairmanship aspirant of the Party in Ughelli, Delta State was stabbed to death. The deceased, Mr. Jeremiah Oghoveta, who was from Jeremi Ward 10 (III), Ughelli South Local Government Area of the state, was said to have been killed by a younger brother of one the leaders of the party. Oghoveta, in his late 30s, was stabbed on the neck ahead of the nationwide ward congress of the APC which held near God\u2019s Grace Ministry at Okwagbe. It was a tale of sorrow, tears and blood in many states across the country over mere ward congresses with the icing on the disaster in Ekiti where governorship primary which held the same day ended in a fiasco. Thugs stormed the Olukayode Stadium in Ado Ekiti where the primary was conducted and brought the entire exercise to a halt. The exercise was suspended indefinitely after some supporters of some aspirants disrupted the voting process accusing accusing a governorship aspirant, of compromising the process. A meeting of the aspirants held with the Organising Committee led by Nasarawa State Governor, Tanko Al-Makura, resolved to suspend the election indefinitely amidst continued agitations by supporters of the other 32 aspirants. The crisis began when some agents raised observations and protested that officials of the State Security Service, SSS, were dictating to delegates who they should vote for. One of the supporters attacked voting area and a commotion ensued, disrupting the entire process. Police and other security agencies shot sporadically into the air to scare the supporters from further doing damage. Many of the delegates scampered for safety outside the venue of the election and did not return. And of course, the combatants have been throwing brickbats ever since. We ordinarily would not be worried much about these internal affairs of the APC if they were not the ruling party. That they run the government that would run the 2019 elections create serious scare in the land.Those who cannot play by rules of decency and fairness within are not likely to deploy such without. The fellows who are drawing guns over ward congresses would deploy ballistic missiles when they they have to face general elections with other parties. If others have to prepare themselves to be able to engage them,it will be a house of war. Feedback \u2026Mercy killing for Dino? A DAY after I wrote about Senator Dino Melaye here last week, he was charged to court in Abuja on different charges. One of them was attempted suicide.That suggests that the Nigerian state was alive to its responsibility of ensuring that no citizen is allowed to take his or her own life. But the applause for that was yet to die down when Dino was wheeled to Lokoja on a stretcher the following day and arraigned before some magistrate court on some conspiracy charge.It was a gory sight reminiscent of when we paid some mercenaries to put Umaru Dikko in a coffin and bring him to Nigeria. The Magistrate would not grant a dying man bail but remanded him in custody till 11th June, 2018. A day more would have been June 12! A man was charged for surviving a suicide bid but now the state wants to administer mercy killing? Related",

        "text": "By Obi Nwakanma Mr. Muhammadu Buhari, incumbent president of the federation of Nigeria has officially been nominated, and handed the ticket of his party \u2013 the All Peoples Congress \u2013 as its candidate for the presidential elections in 2019. That election is just around the corner. The canvasing is afoot. The horse-trading too. The alignment and realignment of forces. INEC The midnight walks that yield surprises \u2013 all leading to what is shaping to be a most contentious polls in 2019. President Buhari was elected in a surprise turn of events in 2015. This was the fourth of his attempts, and he threw in everything, including threats of a bloodtide if he did not win \u2013 his now famous \u201cmonkey and baboon\u201d quip that will haunt his legacy down the ages. Many analysts in fact now say it was the very fear of that promised bloodtide from \u201cthe North,\u201d that convinced the former President Dr. Goodluck Jonathan to concede the elections, and accept defeat. Jonathan had always said that the loss of a single Nigerian life was not worth his ambition. He stood true to his convictions, and like a true democrat, invited Buhari to lead, when the polls closed, and it seemed clear that Buhari was in the lead by some means. Jonathan did not contend, and indeed quickly shut down a move, led by Godwin Orubebe, to question the veracity of the results and the conduct therefore of the elections, and presumably initiate a move towards its cancellation. Jonathan did not wish to blow up the country. He seemed also in unseemly awe of the \u201cinternational community\u201d \u2013 mostly an alliance of the United States, France and the UK governments \u2013 who had unambiguously backed Buhari and his new partners of the then new coalition called the \u201cAPC.\u201d Perhaps nothing would have happened had Jonathan stubbornly summoned Nigeria\u2019s sovereign will, and challenged the results that came. Afterall, there were very clearly recorded images of underage children voting in great numbers places like Kano which gave Buhari massive numbers. Had he wished to play the long game, Jonathan could have, given the enormous power he had, used the power of state and of his incumbency to suppress the votes of Nigerians North, South and Central. He could very easily have deployed troops on the streets to quell any ensuing riots especially in restive areas of the North and could have called it, \u201cOperation Crocodile Dance,\u201d claiming residual emergency power already granted him by the 7th Assembly. He could in fact have read the tea leaves, and could have used the excuse of the Boko Haram insurgency which he had very successfully contained in spite of the subversions of folk, including the current president, and declared the North in a permanent state of crisis and a thus a national security risk, and postponed the general elections as a result of the insurgency. Under guise of a national emergency, he could have governed with the let of the then National Assembly of which his party had a majority, which could review his emergency tenure every six months, until he declares normalcy. But thankfully Jonathan was not tempted by overreach. He ran a broad-based government. He reached out to all parts of Nigeria in an effort to balance power and achieve national representation; he tried to bring all sections of the nation to the table. The problem was, he was listening mostly to elite interests, and not the interest of a wider category of the Nigerian middle class from which he emerged \u2013 the professionals, the workers, the town unions, the intellectuals \u2013 all of whom formed his natural power base, but who felt betrayed by Jonathan\u2019s economic and domestic policies, and his consorting with the same old elite national and international interests that have always overdetermined Nigeria\u2019s political outcomes. The problem was that Jonathan came to power without a rolodex of his own. He was only slowly growing into his own man, and forming his own networks, except that he was often blindsided by his inexperience. I remember my early conversations with my friend, the late Oronto Douglas, whom Jonathan had appointed Director of Strategies on how to protect Dr. Jonathan. But it was clear that by his own unique individual weaknesses and his unique disabilities as an outsider to the traditional equation of power, both Oronto Douglas and his man Jonathan, not always as \u201cswift\u201d and witty, felt the need to look over their shoulders for some lurking myth of \u201cpower\u201d outside of themselves, that they had sometimes to make fatal compromises. Jonathan was called \u201cweak\u201d by his severest critics because he would not use brutal and illegal means to oppress Nigerians, hunt down his opponents, or violate the rule of law. But under him, Nigerians felt the highest sense of freedom and liberty. There was a great sense of prosperity; Nigeria seemed again to matter in the world; she began to regain her place both economically and socially; there was increasing reverse migration, as those in the \u201cdiaspora\u201d began a steady move back home. Now, almost four years after he was voted out, it seems appropriate to say all this, and put in perspective, the humongous changes that have happened under the current president, Muhammadu Buhari, who was elected on a momentum of \u201cchange.\u201d Now, change to what? That was the question critical Nigerians asked in 2015, and nobody seemed to have answers. Jonathan was not voted out for mismanaging the economy. Indeed, even at that time, his opponents agreed that there was real economic growth, there were more people with jobs, there was more money circulating, but Jonathan was voted out on two main issues raised by his opponents: he was a \u201cweak\u201d president, because he compromised too much; and because he compromised too much, he could not deal seriously with the Boko Haram insurgents who had grown bold, and among other things, kidnapped over two hundred Nigerian girls in a very swift operation in Chibok; and because he could not account for the Chibok girls and deal with Boko Haram, he was put on the marked list by key players in the \u201cinternational community,\u201d some of whom also had some very strategic issues with Jonathan in terms of his domestic and foreign policies which directly affected the long and short term interests of these foreign players in Nigerian affairs. In response to Boko Haram, Jonathan established a special task force to deal with the issue in the presidency and placed the operational power under the charge of his National Security Adviser. He had secured a special $1 billion supplementary budget from the National Assembly. In the course of this operation, and because his administration had to buy military equipment in the black market (his opponents had successfully campaigned against the sale of arms to his government), a campaign of calumny was launched against his administration by his political opponents. His government was repeatedly called \u201ccorrupt\u201d until it stuck among the Plebeians who often do not have the time or even the luxury, or intellect to discern the deeper issues of statecraft but are perfect ventriloquists for catchphrases and polispeak. In this age of the social media, just craft a word, gin it up a bit, and it begins to ride the crest of popular assertion. Riding on these waves, Buhari and the APC came to power. Now, Nigerians have since seen Buhari\u2019s efforts. It is appropriate, going towards this elections, to x-ray Buhari in his first term. It is prudent of course to use the balance of his performance to weigh his next moves. All the issues which APC campaigned against in 2015 have multiplied under this government: the Boko Haram insurgency which had very nearly been wiped out by the end of Jonathan\u2019s time in office, has grown fiercer under Buhari. Boko Haram not only continues to fight, it has also kidnapped over 200 girls, this time in Dapchi under Buhari\u2019s watch. Among its victims is a young Christian girl, Leah Sharibu, whose voice continues to haunt this nation and this administration. Leah has become \u201cSaint Leah of Dapchi,\u201d patron saint of all kidnapped women. Under this presidency, Nigerians seem even more divided: the neo-Biafra movement has grown under this administration with IPOB asserting its right to self-determination. The president\u2019s ethnocentrism and narrow, identity politics has created a sense of deep division among Nigerians, so much that schismatic movements are growing; the Cattle Fulani \u2013 the so-called Herdsmen are in rampage; any modicum of faith in Nigeria as a \u201csingle organic nation\u201d of equal opportunities have faded under this administration, and more than anything else, this feeling that not all Nigerians share the same sense of national belonging according to the president\u2019s critics, creates the highest national security risk for corporate Nigeria. There is very little pubic buy-in to government policies and operations, and this has led to closure of businesses; serious port congestion, the hoarding of capital; greater unemployment cycles, and a generally very bleak economic outlook for a market the size of Nigeria\u2019s. The Federal Office of Statistics have rolled out data that suggests that unemployment grew by double digits since Buhari came to power. To be continued\u2026 Related",

        "author": "Obi Nwakanma",
        "text": "By Obi Nwakanma President Buhari spent the better part of his tenure making excuses for his inability to effect the \u201cchange\u201d in the situation of Nigeria on which he campaigned and for which he was elected. Within the first six months of his administration, Nigeria went into massive recession; the economic gains recorded under Jonathan, arguable as they might be, disappeared. With it disappeared the growing confidence of Nigeria. Buhari promised to quickly reverse the energy crisis in Nigeria \u2013 particularly in the areas of electricity generation and distribution. He appointed the former governor of Lagos Mr. Raji Fashola as the Minister of Energy (Power) and Works: two powerful ministries which are frankly too strategic to be bundled under the same portfolio. A ministry of Works and Infrastructure development would have been a more apt portfolio. In any case, Mr. Fashola as governor of Lagos had critiqued the PDP government for its inability to solve the power problem, and indeed boasted that it would take only six months to solve Nigeria\u2019s electricity problem under a different order. I still think he is right. But so far, he has not proved his own point. Nigeria is still mired in an energy crisis of such proportions that merely complaining about it is no more worthwhile. Fact is: the policies over the years of privatization have only created ineffective monopolies, and the Buhari government which has continued this policy of privatization has showed very clearly that it has no original ideas of its own. The changes in the energy policies carried out under Obasanjo and pushed further still by Jonathan as a PDP program is shortsighted, very clearly, and has been disastrous, chiefly because no sovereign nation cedes its most important, most strategic public utilities to private monopolies, foreclosing public investment that should drive a development agenda. The situation, created just for instance, by the monopoly, the Enugu Power Company, bought and controlled by Mr. Emeka Ofo, for instance, is creating a problem that affects expanding and servicing the Eastern energy market, going by the face-off between Enugu DISCO and the Geometric Energy Company, founded by Dr. Bath Nnaji. This is just one example of the consequences of the energy policies established by the PDP, which campaigned on privatization of public corporations in Electricity, Communications, steel, roads, etc, \u2013 a policy which has failed Nigerians, because frankly privatization and the corrupt sell-off of Nigeria\u2019s public investments in circumstances that are still foggy, has not solved Nigeria\u2019s problem, but has exacerbated it. Yet, the APC under Buhari continues to follow the same programs which were the very sources of corruption in the system. In many cases, because the APC lacks the organizational capacity to organize an effective government, it has worsened the legacy it inherited of public corruption. Nigerians still do not have any idea how much oil Nigeria sells or batters. How much is stolen. How much is given as gift or bribe. How much revenue comes with oil and how much of it is truly accounted? The operations of this crucial arm of state, the Petroleum industry is still opaque, and still is controlled directly by the president. There are a number of factors that might account for the failure, going towards the election year, of the APC administration to rise to the expectations of Nigeria: one, they probably did not comprehend the enormity of the task of running the nation in a democratic system. Buhari came into power claiming to be a \u201creformed democrat,\u201d but he was in truth, still unaware of the demands of a constitutional government, which is what we call a democracy. He did not have any idea about such a pesky thing called the \u201crule of law.\u201d He still had the illusion that he could govern by fiat, and by extreme executive authority just as he did as the Commander-In-Chief of the Armed Forces under a military regime, in which parliamentary, and sometimes judicial authority converged under the executive power of the Military Head of state who could hire and fire anyone, enact laws by fiat, and push any policy, and enter into any treaty with a foreign government or institution without recourse to the Legislature and the Judiciary. It still does not occur to him that he cannot enter into a treaty or an agreement with the IMF or World Bank today, or enter into any treaty with China, without the enabling votes of the National Assembly, and that any such treaties entered on behalf of Nigeria primarily on his initiative without legislative authority is a nonbinding agreement. In the past all it would take him was a memo from his Chief Secretary, and a discussion of it as an agenda in the Supreme Military Council, and bingo, Nigeria takes a loan, or sets up a Tribunal to try Ambrose Alli or Mbakwe or Onabanjo, or Vatsa, or whomever the Head of State declares an \u201cenemy of the state,\u201d and it took the same Council to order their execution, whether or not the Supreme Court agrees. Under this system, \u201cNational Security\u201d entirely meant the \u201csecurity of the government in power\u201d and the protection with all kinds of perversity of the Head of that government. But that is no longer the case. For as long as Nigeria has a National Assembly, which shares equal, and sometimes greater power than the president, the source of laws and the making of the laws to which even the President is circumscribed is the Legislature. Willful breaking of the laws of Nigeria or disregard of the acts enacted by the National Assembly by any president is regarded as a high crime for which such a president could be investigated, impeached, and tried by a tribunal mandated by the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court. And this change in the status of the Head of state or President under a democracy governed by laws means that the president must develop the skills for negotiations if his/her agenda is to be supported and passed in the National Assembly. The president must be transparent or he would face scrutiny and inquiries that might lead to a constitutional clash, and often, no president wins a war with a properly established legislature. Obasanjo, leading the PDP government, was allowed to run rough-shod over the National Assembly without much consequence, and break the laws of Nigeria, because Nigeria was just coming out of a traumatic era of military dictatorship, and not many wanted to rock the apple cart, or challenge him too much. But this situation is changing rapidly as citizens investment in nation-building grows. This 8th Assembly under the leadership of Saraki and Yakubu Dogara, more than any since the second transition to democracy, has asserted legislative independence, and confronted the presidency on key legislative and policy issues. It could of course do more. At the beginning of the legislative cycle, the APC had clearly won a majority, and seemed all set to run the government with but slight opposition. That is, they controlled the senate, the House of Representatives- with comfortable majorities, and they had the Presidency. They could pass any legislation, push through the president\u2019s agenda, both his domestic agenda and his foreign policy, and they could effect \u201cchange.\u201d But it quickly became evident that one, the party that won the elections had no program of action. It took this president about eighth months to establish a functioning government. In the period, between the President\u2019s listless and confused dawdling, and the internal rifts that quickly emerged in his party\u2019s Legislative leadership, Nigeria slid into serious economic crisis. Investor confidence declined. Consumer capacity became limited given the low circulation of money. Job losses quickly followed with these congeries of factors. To further this growing crisis, President Buhari\u2019s appointments and early policy thrust quickly alienated a critical population of Nigerians, especially the Igbo, catalysts of Nigeria\u2019s economic life, many who began to hoard capital in fear of what they felt were Buhari\u2019s adversarial policies, and close shops, and in some cases move their businesses abroad. The hoary effect of the Buhari years has been economic uncertainty, division, and the uncertainty of National security and public safety. It is difficult to point to any real achievements in the last four years of this presidency. Corruption is still very high, and would remain so for as long as the public bureaucracy remains in its current composition and structure. Nigeria remains unsafe from Boko Haram and the so-called Fulani militia are on the prowl. Poverty is rife. The populace is vastly alienated from public leadership. Buhari, and his party\u2019s recourse has been to continue to blame Jonathan almost four years to the day. The excuse that Jonathan had more revenue and left too many problems inherited by this administration has also been shot down by Buhari\u2019s critics who point out that he has enjoyed equally high oil revenue compared to the first six years of the Obasanjo administration, which still managed, whether one likes Obasanjo or not, to effect significant economic turn-around with far less than Buhari has received. These are the issues that confront Buhari as he seeks re-election. Related",

        "author": "Aare Afe Babalola",
        "text": "By Aare Afe Babalola \u201cThe Arab spring which some years ago swept away many leaders across the Arab world was motivated largely by the high rate of unemployment and poverty. Before then and hundreds of years earlier, the French revolution occurred when the poor could no longer afford the price of a loaf of bread\u201d. Last week, I identified education as one of those matters which require urgent attention in the run up to the 2019 general elections. I stated how the fortunes of the country\u2019s educational institutions had declined steadily leading to a situation in which graduates of Nigerian Universities find it difficult to secure jobs even from Nigerian business concerns. This development without doubt has brought about a high unemployment rate, poverty and slowed the pace of the country\u2019s economic development. This surely cannot aide or foster national unity. Post Independence Nigeria Prior to independence, unemployment and poverty were not the problems that they now pose to the country. Jobs were available for the few educated Nigerians. Even those who were not deemed educated by western standards did not suffer a shortage of jobs. This was perhaps due to the low population of the country. In 1955, the population of Lagos numbered at 312,000. By 1980, due to rural urban migration, it has risen to about 3000000 (three million). In the immediate period after independence, unemployment was still not a problem. Most graduates already had job offers even before leaving school. This was partly due to the fact that the country was structured along the regional basis allowing for growth of the regions on the basis of resources available to it. As I have stated earlier, whilst the Western Region was noted for cocoa production, the Eastern and Northern Regions had palm oil and groundnut respectively. With prudent management, the resources which accrued from agriculture were utilized in several sectors of the economy leading to a creation of jobs for the population. However, with the coming of the military and the discovery of oil in commercial quantity, things took a turn. Agriculture which hitherto had been the mainstay of the economy was abandoned as Nigerians reveled in the sudden abundance of wealth provided by oil exploration. Successive government paid little attention to economic and infrastructural development. Critical sectors such as power without which there can hardly be industrial development were totally ignored. Consequent upon this, many manufacturing concerns went under and even small businesses were unable to stay afloat. Yet at this most critical point, Nigeria was still producing graduates from the numerous universities across the country. Furthermore, to add to the problem, the universities were themselves grappling with numerous crises such as strikes, dilapidated infrastructure, brain drain, etc. which were not totally unrelated to the poor state of the economy. Therefore, Nigeria was suddenly faced with a situation in which the economy could not absorb graduates being produced by the universities while at the same time; the universities were themselves producing unemployable graduates. Ills of unemployment Unemployment anywhere in the world is a major problem which cannot be ignored. It is linked to several societal ills such as crime, drug abuse, societal decadence, etc. In Nigeria unemployment rate is reported by the National Bureau of Statistics. From 2006 to 2011, the unemployment rate averaged 14.6%. It recorded a record low percent of 5.6 in December 2006. In 2011, it recorded an all-time high of 23.9%. At a time, figures released from the National Bureau of Statistics stated that 5.3 million youths are jobless in Nigeria while 1.8 million graduates enter the labour market every year. The problem has been on for some time due to the inability of authorities to track the numbers of persons entering the labour market every year. As at the 3rd quarter of 2017, the unemployment rate in Nigeria , according to africacheck.org stood at 18.8% while the total percentage of unemployed and underemployed stood at 40%. The body stated as follows: \u201cNigeria\u2019s latest unemployment data is for July to September 2017. A total of 51.1 million people was estimated to be in full-time employment during this period, or working at least 40 hours a week.The country\u2019s unemployment rate stood at 18.8%, as Spectator Index had tweeted. It was the twelfth consecutive rise since the last quarter of 2014. (Note: Nigeria experienced a slowdown in economic growth from 2014 and entered into a recession in 2016, only exiting it in the second quarter of 2017.)In absolute numbers, the number of people who were unemployed had increased to an estimated 15.9 million, while the underemployed were at about 18 million (21.2%).Combined, 40% of the country\u2019s labour force were therefore either underemployed or had no job.\u201d Highest levels of unemployment Jigawa, Rivers, Kaduna, Yobe and Akwa Ibom states had the highest levels with 62.4%, 61.4%, 58.6%, 58.1% and 54.8% respectively. Ondo which had the lowest rate recorded 34.5% Where there is unemployment there is bound to be poverty. If young Nigerians after acquiring educational or vocational training are unable to find jobs, there is bound to be an effect on the rate of poverty in the country. Ours is a society which places emphasis on the nuclear structure of the family with the effect that a salary earner in most cases is responsible for the upkeep not only of his immediate family comprising of his spouse and children but comprising also of a retinue of relatives. Thus the unemployment of one individual in our society is bound to affect the abilities of several others to maintain a meaningful or reasonable level of economic existence. Unemployment and poverty are not a good mix to have in any political structure particularly where that structure such as is the case in Nigeria suffers from other deficiencies such as a lack of unity amongst its various ethnic identities. Whatever may be the motivation of terrorists who have again stepped up their campaign of calumny in some parts of Borno State, it cannot be denied that poverty and unemployment provide fertile ground for breeding destructive ideas. A person who is poor and perhaps without any hope of gainful employment will be an easy target for criminal element intent on persuading him to join their ranks. Way out It is therefore necessary for governments at the federal, state and local government levels to urgently address issues of unemployment and poverty. A situation in which the Federal Government takes the largest chunk of revenue accruing to the country is one that should be urgently addressed and reversed. At the moment, the local governments which are designed to be the closest to the people and therefore positioned to best affect their lives positively are starved of the funds needed to carry out their duty. To make matters worse, a large percentage of revenue which does come in is used to service political structures. Salaries and emoluments of local government chairmen and political appointees account for a large percentage of the expenditure of most local governments. This situation is replicated across the state and federal levels where the salaries and emoluments of commissioners, special assistants, senior special assistants and others take up a huge percentage of revenue. When this is added to the cost of running a bicameral legislature at the federal level and the houses of assembly of each state, it is not difficult to see why meaningful policies to address unemployment and poverty are seemingly not of primary importance or concern. The time to act As politicians criss-cross Nigeria and the globe to secure their political futures and fortunes, they should factor in matters which are of uppermost interest and concern to those they seek to serve. They should realise that the ever widening gap between the rich and poor and increasing poverty levels have never served any society well. If left unchecked, these are developments that will forever ensure that true unity is elusive in Nigeria. The Arab spring which some years ago swept away many leaders across the Arab world was motivated largely by the high rate of unemployment and poverty. Before then and hundreds of years earlier, the French revolution occurred when the poor could no longer afford the price of a loaf of bread. It is said in some quarters, that unless something urgently is done to address poverty, that the poor will have nothing left to eat but the rich. To be continued\u2026 Related",

        "author": "Aare Afe Babalola",
        "text": "By Aare Afe Babalola Last week, whilst discussing the effect of poverty and unemployment on the issue of national unity in the run up to the general elections of 2019, I called on politicians to factor into their political calculations, matters which are of uppermost interest and concern to those they seek to serve. However, it is important to note that such issues can only naturally be of concern to politicians and candidates of political parties who are credible in themselves. This is why it is important to highlight the correlation between our current constitutional make-up and the substance or credibility of a vast majority of candidates who eventually emerge to seek political office in Nigeria. Nigeria as a Nation has for several decades been engaged in a constant struggle for the evolution of the perfect electoral system. It is the dream of many Nigerians that the country should have an electoral system in which transparency is made the watch word from voter registration to actual voting, collation of votes, announcement of votes and declaration of results. To achieve this, the lawmakers have on several occasions tinkered with the country\u2019s electoral laws. Since the advent of civilian administration in 1999, three Electoral Laws have been passed by the National Assembly i.e Electoral Act, 2002, Electoral Act, 2006 and Electoral Act, 2010 (As Amended). As noble and commendable as the efforts of the legislature has been, recent events in the run-up to the 2019 general elections reveal that something fundamental is still amiss. It appears that much more needs to be done rather than minor amendments to the Electoral Law to correct minor blips noticed in the implementation of the previous law. The current rash of defections across parties lends credence to this view. It is in the light of this that some have constantly advocated that much attention should be paid to the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, 1999. These demands as we shall subsequently discuss are not entirely without basis. Independence Constitution making In the march towards independence, the leaders of Nigeria at that time were unified in their common purpose of convincing the British to give up their political and administrative hold on Nigeria and grant her independence. This unity of purpose underlined negotiations leading up to the eventual decision on independence and more importantly on the make-up and future of post independence Nigeria. Therefore, the talks which held at Lancaster house in London at which the founding fathers of Nigeria such as the late Sardauna of Sokoto, Sir Ahmadu Bello, the first President of Nigeria, Dr. Nnamdi Azikwe, the first Prime Minister, Alhaji Abubakar Tafawa Balewa and Chief Obafemi Awolowo were present was characterised by insightful debates and concessions in order to arrive at a balanced federation. Therefore, in arriving at the independence Constitution, the founding fathers of the nation had due regard to the diverse nature of the sections which make up modern day Nigeria. Nigeria is a vast country with diverse ethnicities, each with their different languages, culture, tradition, religion and attitude to work etc. This far-sightedness ensured that even after Nigeria became a republic in 1963, the constituent regions of Nigeria were able to move and develop in an atmosphere of healthy competition. Whilst the Western Region was able to record significant progress with its cocoa plantations, the North and the East recorded an equally successful rate of development with the groundnut pyramids in Kano and palm oil in the East. Nigeria at that time could also boast of good roads, excellent health care services, sound educational institutions and infrastructure and an evolving electoral system which ensured active participation and representation across all political and geographical spheres. Revenue of the government was shared amongst the centre and the constituent regions in such a way that the states were strong enough to embark on agricultural and the industrial development. Each party knew its legislative limit. Such was the level of development and promise that Nigeria at that time was adjudged one of the fastest developing economies of the world. The process of promulgation of the Constitution as stated above and which in return brought about development to the country had a profound effect on the political class. The leaders making up the political class owing to the environment and culture of public responsibility, which to a large extent had been nurtured by them, were very careful not to erode the progress which had been recorded. The electoral system itself ensured that only politicians with a real desire to serve were elected to public office. Politicians at that time did not seek public office simply for the type of huge remuneration which public office holders today enjoy. As a matter of fact, legislators and local government councillors were only paid sitting allowances as opposed to the fat salaries and housing and other numerous allowances which they enjoy today. Electoral brigandage as we know it today was virtually non-existent. The intellectual quality of the political class itself was second to none. This much can be ascertained by the quality of debate in the various legislative houses as recorded in their various hansards. Military incursion and its effect on democratic institutions However, military incursion into governance in 1966 brought about an extinction of not only the political structures which are themselves synonymous with the concept of democracy, it also ensured that the tenets and principles of democracy which at that time had become ingrained in individual and national consciousness were absolutely relegated to the background. In place of the Executive and Legislative arms of government, the military between 1966 and 1979 fused the functions of both bodies in a supreme military body which with the coming and going of subsequent military regimes attained different names and acronyms such as Supreme Military Council (SMC) and Armed Forces Ruling Council (AFRC) to mention but a few. This dark spot in our national history without a doubt played a significant role in bringing about some of the problems experienced today in our electoral system. For one, the 13 years of military rule between 1966 and 1979 ensured that the political class which emerged after the handover of 1979 had spent 13 years of their lives under military rule which in any part of the world is not known to be democratic. As stated earlier, structures such as political parties which would overtime have sustained political consciousness had been proscribed under military rule. So what we had in the run-up to the hand-over of the military in 1979 was a hurried assemblage of people of divergent political views and inclinations into marriages of convenience called political parties. The result was the anomalies experienced in the administration of the country between 1979 and 1983 which incidentally the military itself gave as an excuse to return to governance in late 1983. Between 1983 and 1999, with the exception of the brief reign of the Interim National Government of Chief Ernest Shonekan which lasted barely six months, the country spent a further 16 years under military rule. If military rule between 1966 and 1979 can be said to have had a profound effect on the political class of 1979 to 1983, then a much stronger adjective must be found to describe the effect of military incursion between 1983 and 1999 on the political class which has emerged since 1999. Promulgation of 1999 Constitution The 1999 Constitution was itself promulgated by the military for Nigerians. However in thrusting the 1999 Constitution on Nigerians, the military unfortunately did not ensure that it went through the same process that produced the Independence Constitution which Constitution as stated earlier recognised the diversity of the ethnicities that make up Nigeria. This act of the military has brought about a situation in which the centre contrary to the true principle of Federalism is too strong. Too much power is concentrated in the hands of few that make up the Federal Government of Nigeria. On the revenue front a large percentage of the revenue of federation goes to the Federal Government with the state scrambling for the little that remains. This over-concentration of power and resources as we shall subsequently discuss has its own effect on the quality of leadership that emerges from our electoral system. Furthermore most of the current politicians spent a larger percentage of their lives living in a country without any form of democratic structure. Thus, many politicians grew up without the slightest notion of what democracy meant in practice. All that they knew about democracy was in most cases its definition as given to them by their teachers in secondary schools. Is it therefore surprising that these same politicians to this moment still grapple with the concept of democracy in its true form? To be continued\u2026 Related",

        "author": "Aare Afe Babalola",
        "text": "By Aare Afe Babalola Last week, I discussed of the Constitutional development of Nigeria from the pre-independence era to the present one and its effect on the credibility of candidates nominated by political parties for elective office. I highlighted how the fore-fathers of the Nigerian nation were able, due to their knowledge of the country and their political savvy, to fashion out a Constitution which recognised and positively exploited the ethnic diversity of the nation. I examined how the differences in the process of enactment of the pre-independence Constitution and subsequent Constitutions which have been forced on Nigerians have respectively had on the emergence of the political class and the country\u2019s political fortune. I concluded by stating how and why the 1999 constitution may not be truly reflective of the wishes of Nigerian populace contrary to the content of the preamble of the said Constitution which seems to suggest that it (the Constitution) is the outcome of a well-thought-out Constitutional making process embarked upon by the Nigerian people. FEDERALISM UNDER NIGERIAN CONSTITUTION Nigeria at the present moment is made up of 36 states and the Federal Capital Territory, Abuja. The idea of federalism which is practised in Nigeria today was taken or borrowed from the American and Australian models. In these jurisdictions, persons of divergent nationalities, races, creeds, ethnicities etc have been able to come together to co-exist under one political and national identity. The United States of America for example is made up of the Native Americans, Hispanics, African Americans, Latin Americans, English, French, Italian, Portuguese, Dutch etc. Americans themselves proudly refer to the country as one created by immigrants. The countries despite this wide diversity of their people have continued to flourish. This is so as the Constitution recognise the component units as the heart and soul of the union and do not concentrate power in the centre. In Nigeria, the reverse is the case as power is concentrated in the Federal Government of Nigeria. The Federal Government controls virtually all important means of revenue generation with the result that a large chunk of revenue generated from the vast resources of the Country end up in the coffers of the Federal Government. The Federal Government, as provided by the Constitution then assumes the role of a big brother and decides what each State will get as its own share of the national revenue. The immediate impact of this is felt in the corruption that has pervaded our political class. Each state and local government receives what is known as monthly allocation from the Federal Government of Nigeria. The ongoing prosecution of some past office holders on account of misappropriation of funds from the monthly allocations of their state or local government shows that the said allocation is seen by politicians as a prime opportunity to corruptly enrich themselves. Most politicians now seek elective office so as to partake in the sharing of this \u201cnational loot\u201d. Governors and Local Government Chairmen all eagerly await this monthly disbursement of the National cake. Such is the emphasis placed on money accruing to the State from the Federation Account that little or no attention is paid by political office holders at the state and local government levels to opportunities of improving the internally generated revenue of the respective states. One would expect that a populace very much aware of the overall political and economic aspirations of the country would jealously ensure that its leadership lives up to the barest minimum of political and financial accountability. This unfortunately is not the case in Nigeria. Nigerians have over-time come to gradually accept as a normal way of life the morbid corruption which has engulfed the political class. Rather than serve as a check on corrupt politicians, Nigerians it would seem by their very action encourage politicians to be corrupt. There has always been a debate over the huge wages, allowances and expenses of members of the National Assembly. Interestingly, some members of the National Assembly have justified this anomaly on the volume of request for one form of financial assistance or the other from members of their political constituency. In essence, the defence is that the money which they collect is ploughed back into feeding, clothing and accommodating their friends, relatives, political dependants and numerous others. Little wonder then that the system of Government in Nigeria was derisively described not too long ago by a political writer as \u201clootocracy\u201d i.e. \u201cgovernment of the looters for the looters and by the looters\u201d. CONSTITUTION AND POLITICAL PARTIES Sections 221-229 of the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, 1999 provide for the creation and regulations of the affairs of political parties. Whilst it is not in doubt that political freedom is a sine qua non for emergence of a sound political and electoral system, the leeway available in the above-stated section of the Constitution appears to have brought about a vast number of political parties which are truly lacking in any appreciable form of political, social or economic ideology. The need to allow Nigerians to freely come together and form political parties arose primarily from the experience of the military transition programme in the late 80/ earlier 90s when politicians could only join any of the two political parties established by the then military junta. It was thought that Nigerians would be able to take advantage of the opportunity to form political parties of their choice to establish parties which would in the due course of time formulate and be guided by strong political ideology which development it was hoped would impact positively on the political consciousness and development of the average Nigerian and Nigeria itself. But what do we have now? We have political parties which appear not to know the basic reasons for their existence. Political parties in Nigeria today are more or less marriages of convenience contrived for the singular reason of winning elections at all cost. Most political parties do not have any visible physical structure or identifiable means of coordinating the activities of their membership.Indeed, some parties appear only to exist in the brief case of their founders. How else can one explain the seeming penchant of some political parties to advertise their availability to disgruntled members of other political parties who seek a platform upon which to achieve their political aspirations? This is moreso when all parties are ordinarily expected to have their own membership consisting of persons who would have indicated interests in contesting elections on the platform of said political party. Thus, our political history is replete with instances of political office holders who have abandoned their parties, even where they were elected on the platform of the said party for other opposition parties at the drop of the hat. One wonders what has happened to the concept of loyalty by politicians to a particular political ideology. The lack of identity of purpose or cohesion in these political parties manifests itself primarily in the quality of candidates which they throw up or produce for the purpose of election. This is to be expected for a party which itself lacks any form of ideological or social identity cannot be expected to require or enforce such amongst its membership. Thus the anomaly immediately rears its head in the primaries of these parties where the win at all cost attitude is often the order of the day. After the conduct of the primaries, the same scenario plays itself out in the general election where the politician would employ all manner of underhand tactics including votes for cash, ballot box snatching, stuffing etc to win an election at all cost. Yet, it is from these same set of persons that Nigerians are expected to elect political office holders who would lead the country into economic, political and social development. As we say in law, one cannot put something on nothing and expect it to stand. The solutions to the problems discussed are multi-faceted. Genuine efforts must be made at bringing about a Constitution which is truly representative of the wishes and aspirations of the Nigerian people. Without this, a search for a nation where persons of integrity would be voted into office might continue to be a forever elusive objective to be sought but never to be attained. Nigerians on their part must become far-sighted in their measurement and appraisal of the political class. Many are at the present moment myopic in their assessment of the political class for the singular reason that they prefer whatever illicit gain is available to be had at the moment to the eventual political and economic stability of the country. Nigerians must demand and enforce a universally accepted standard of political accountability from their leaders. This can only be done when Nigerians realise the power of their votes and use it accordingly for the betterment of the country. Related",

        "text": "Map of Nigeria By Aare Afe Babalola \u201cGovernment must realise the importance of and create an enabling environment for education to drive development in Nigeria if we seriously wish to achieve national integration and security\u201d. Last week I discussed the need for closer attention to the question of national unity particularly as the general eleactions of 2019 draw near. I highlighted the results of the Presidential elections in 2015 as a pointer to the fact that ours is a country that is still divided along ethnic and tribal lines. Regrettably, less than a year to the next elections, more attention, as it was before previous elections,is again being given to religious and ethnic considerations than to the political ideology of parties and their candidates. 55 years of independence appears not to have changed the issues that matter in national elections in Nigeria. However there needs to be a change. It really should not matter whether a candidate is Hausa, Igbo or Yoruba. As far as suitability for political office is concerned, what should matter the most should be the political ideologies of the candidate, the manifesto of his party, his record of service and overall preparedness for service. That change can begin with closer attention to the educational fortunes of the country. Importance of education Without a doubt, any country that aspires to greatness in any sphere of its existence must ensure that education remains of paramount importance. In realization of this, the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria 1999 (As Amended) in Section 18 enjoins the Government to ensure that there are equal education opportunities at all levels and that the Government shall strive to eradicate illiteracy. Even though the provisions of the said section and others like it which fall under the Fundamental Objectives and Directive Principles of State Policy as contained in Chapter II of the Constitution have been held not to be enforceable in a court of Law, its inclusion in the Constitution leaves no room for doubt that the Government is expected to be guided by the ideals contained in the provisions of the section. A large percentage of Nigerian graduates are unemployed despite their qualifications. Foreign and even Nigerian firms find them unsuitable or unemployable for their businesses.This is largely due to the ill-fortune experienced over the decades by Nigerian universities leading to a myriad of challenges such as brain drain, strikes and lack of infrastructure. To bring about an immediate change of fortunes in the lot of Nigerian Universities and other educational institutions, adequate funding must be made available to them.The internal affairs of Universities must as far as practicable, be democratized. In taking decisions concerning the running and administration of Universities, Government must act in the best interests of the Universities. Political consideration must not influence the appointment and removal of University officials. Government must in particular, give attention to the following: A. Enforceable constitutional rights to education: To promote accessible, affordable and available education of the Nigerian people, the supreme law i.e. our constitution must recognize the basic right to education as a justifiable and enforceable right. The current constitution, foisted on Nigerians by the military in 1999, unscrupulously placed education under Chapter II called the Fundamental Objectives and Directive Principles of State Policy. This portion of the Constitution indeed graciously and rightly provides that: \u201cThe Government shall strive to eradicate illiteracy; and to this end Government shall, as and when practicable, provide (a) free, compulsory and universal primary education; (b) free secondary education; (c) free university education; and (d) free adult literacy programme\u201d. While these are all very good and robust provisions, section 6(6) (c), paragraph (c) of the same Constitution however provides that the Judiciary shall have no powers to decide on any issue or question as to whether any act of omission by any authority or person is in conformity with the Fundamental Objectives and Directive Principles of State Policy. This provision makes it impossible, for citizens to sue the government for failing to provide free or quality education. In essence, like a Greek gift, the constitution in one breadth contains wishful aspirations or dreams about education, and in another breath takes it away from the citizens. There is an urgent need to modify these archaic provisions and recognize education as an important and enforceable fundamental human right. B. Sustained Budgeting and Funding: Considering the level of infrastructure decay and rot across Nigerian educational institutions, educational security can only be achieved if it is robustly and continually funded. To rapidly catch up with the rest of the world in terms of quality education, there is a need to comply with the international guideline by UNESCO which directs each government to devote 26% of its budget on education. I recall that Chief Awolowo devoted 54% of the budget to education. Targeting a certain percentage of GDP each year would ensure that the education infrastructure deficit is slowly reduced, while demands for new infrastructure are met. The plan could include flexibility to accommodate accelerated educational investment in times of economic slowdown or recession. Nigeria must also engage with international development partners and meet its obligations under joint funding schemes. For example, the UK\u2019s Department for International Development (DFID) has invested in a five-year, \u00a395m programme aimed at assisting the Government of Nigeria to better plan, finance and operate infrastructure, including educational infrastructure. The Nigerian Government must be transparent, accountable and committed to the proper utilization of such funds for education. A combination of government funding and international development funding could deliver real and measurable financial capital base to realise and meet the expenditure required for financing the education sector. It will also provide robust financial basis for Nigeria to roll out scholarships and grants programs to support affordable education. Rather than borrow money to buy bulletproof cars, a serious nation will invest money to build the future, which is innovation and education. With education, the political class will find little or no need for bulletproof cars, as every youth will be able to attain a respectable source of income. C. Investment in Research and Innovation The importance of innovation cannot be overemphasised. It is not a mere coincidence that Nigeria\u2019s glorious years in terms of national economic development were years when our Universities were equally known for delivering significant innovation and research. However, poor funding, brain drain, infrastructural deficiency, poor ethical standards and different levels of institutional corruption are some of the reasons why Nigerian Universities can no longer drive innovation. Unless this situation is reversed, Nigeria will continue to depend on foreign technology and goods as the foundation for its infrastructural projects. This is an approach that has failed us for several years and will continue to do so. Countries that have achieved meaningful development realised this and have dedicated significant national funding to research and innovation. In several developed countries, universities are the ones spearheading Research, Applied Technology, High-tech Industry, Global Management expertise, Export and Economic growth. Take Canada for example, where Aeronautical Engineering Departments have spurred key breakthroughs for Aviation Infrastructure, making Canada a leading manufacturer of aeroplanes (the Bombardier). Electrical Engineering and Computer Science Departments have also provided talented graduates who drive Canada\u2019s Electronics and Software industry, which generates $50 billion in annual exports. Architecture and Civil Engineering Departments have also developed low cost facilities for road and infrastructure construction. And several of Canada\u2019s professors have won Nobel Prizes in Medicine, Engineering and Sciences. This is the same in the United States where Harvard University, a private University, has produced some of the world\u2019s leading Innovators and Engineers. Adequate attention to education If adequate attention is paid to education, I doubt that Politicians will find the minds of young Nigerians as fertile a ground as it is now for the implantation of seeds of disunity which is meant only to serve their own selfish ends on election day. Furthermore, an educated mind is less likely to take up arms or become a suicide bomber, in pursuit of a warped view that western education is a sin, as currently is the case with the long drawn boko haram insurgency. As the International Campaign to Stop Rape and Gender Violence put it; \u201cKnowledge, books, and education have manifold implications when it comes to dealing with conflict\u2026 \u2013 they embody curiosity, independent thought, freedom of speech and expression, and the potential to eventually make up one\u2019s own mind about the world, its events, and its people. A holistic approach to education, or one that goes beyond the teaching of literacy and numeracy, also educates students on current affairs, creative expression, lateral thinking, structured argument and debate. This subsequently gives them the ability to make independent decisions, the freedom to make a difference, and to become young leaders in their own right\u201d Government must realise the importance of and create an enabling environment for education to drive development in Nigeria if we seriously wish to achieve national integration and security.

        "text": "INEC By Aare Afe Babalola Preparation has begun in earnest for the 2019 general elections. Politicians characteristically have begun to break and form alliances in a bid to secure victory at the polls. Many who before now were sworn enemies have suddenly realised the need for dialogue bringing to fore the unspoken code that in politics, there is no permanent friend or enemy. However as is again usual with them, they seem to have forgotten to write into their equation of political alignment and realignments the very thing that should be uppermost in the minds of any political leader truly desirous of serving his people; the unity and interest of the nation and the people they seek to serve. This is why I consider it imperative to remind our leaders that as we prepare for the next elections, adequate attention must be given to certain issues that continue to affect the political, economic and social fortunes this country, the paramount of which should be the all important question of national unity. Result of past elections show a \u2018Nation\u2019 divided along ethnic and tribal lines If anything, the result of the 2015 Presidential elections shows that Nigeria is yet to metamorphose into a nation. It still remains a country of one huge nation and two smaller nations. The voting patterns indicate that Nigerians still choose their national leaders acting largely on ethnic and tribal sentiments. It is a sad commentary on our development as a nation that in electing leaders much more attention is paid to issues of ethnic identity rather than political ideology and party manifestoes. Anyone in doubt should simply put up chart of the states of the federation showing where the candidates of the two main political parties fared the best or had impressive showings. Whilst President Muhammad Buhari had almost the entirety of the votes in the northern parts of the country, the incumbent, President Goodluck Jonathan recorded a similar feat in the South-South and the South-East. While Buhari scored 1.9 Million and 1.3 Million votes in Kano and Katsina States respectively, Jonathan scored 1.4 and 1.1 million votes in Rivers and Delta States respectively. Many have been quick to attribute this to what is known in Nigerian Politics as the \u201chome boy\u201d factor which means nothing other than the fact that a candidate at an election is or will be assured of support of those with whom he shares an ethnic or tribal affinity. I do not believe in this so called \u201chome boy\u201d factor, at least not in the way it is used in Nigeria in which it is in a reality a euphemism for tribal, ethnic and religious sentiments. In my estimation it represents all that is wrong with our aspirations to live as a nation. How did we get here? The push by the founding fathers of the country for independence of Nigeria was driven by a vision of a strong and united country which as projected by international observers, was expected in no time to become a world economic and political power. That the new nation would be made up of over 200 ethnic identities was not seen as a problem but was on the contrary regarded as a unique feature which would ensure a strong and united country. However no sooner had independence been achieved than reality began to set in. It quickly became clear, particularly on the political terrain that it would take much more than a slogan of \u201cunity in diversity\u201d to remove ethnic identities and idiosyncrasies which had become so deeply entrenched in the psyche of the average Nigerian. For one the main political parties were formed among regional lines and among the main tribes of Hausa, Yoruba and Igbo. Talk of and attempts at national integration were sometimes regarded as a betrayal of the regional and tribal cause. As the military coups of 1966 and 1967 would later suggest, the military, the very institution constitutionally required to protect the country from external aggression had itself become overtaken by the same tribal and ethnic sentiments and considerations which had derailed and distracted the political class from the noble and nationalistic objectives they had before then continually proclaimed. Upon the return to democratic rule in 1979 it was felt that the nation would gradually experience a real integration of its people. Schemes such as the National Youth Service Corps (NYSC) had by then been designed and put in place to produce a new generation of Nigerians free of all ethnic colorationof old and inspired only by nationalistic considerations. Well, three military coups later and afteryears of uninterrupted democratic rule (after yet another transition from military to civil rule), it appears that the considerations of old are still with us. It does appear, as they say, that old habits die hard! Post Independence Constitution making process recognised diversity Yet things really should not have been permitted to get this bad. Indeed as I have always argued, diversity should not be a bar to true nationhood but on the contrary if properly harnessed, should even serve as a means towards achieving true nationhood. The founding fathers of the country recognised this fact. In the process leading up to the promulgation of the independence constitution, the fore fathers of the Nigerian nation deliberated extensively in Lancaster house London on several matters which were imperative for the take-off and the development of the new nation. Many of the issues discussed related to the distinct identities of the numerous ethnic groups which were by the amalgamation of 1914 brought together under one constitutional banner. These leaders realized the need to come up with a structure that will preserve the identities of the component ethnicities whilst at the same time allowing for the enthronement of nationalistic sentiments and ideals. It therefore did not come as a surprise when the Independence Constitution provided for regional governments across the country. By this arrangement each region was allowed to develop at its own pace utilizing resources available to it. Nigeria is not alone in Area of Ethnic diversity Before attempting an analysis of the myriad of solutions proffered as a way out it is pertinent to note that Nigeria is not alone in the area of ethnic diversity. In a list containing the ranking of 169 countries according to ethnic diversity of its peoples prepared by James Fearon, Nigeria is ranked 18th with a score of 0.8 and 0.6 in ethnic and religious fractionalisation respectively, with a score of \u201c1\u201d signifying the highest degree of diversity and \u201c0\u201d being the lowest. African Countries such as Cameroon (6), Ghana (13), Uganda (4), South Africa (8), Tanzania (2) and Liberia (5) were all ranked as being more ethnically diverse than Nigeria. As a matter of fact 17 of the top 20 most ethnically diverse countries are all in Africa. This is obviously due to a shared common heritage of colonialism in which unnatural borders, encompassing different ethnic identities into one nation were drawn up by the colonial authorities in the rush for Africa. In his book titled \u201cThe state of Africa\u201d Martin Meredith stated as follows about the birth of most African countries: \u201cThe maps used to carve up the African continent were mostly inaccurate; large areas were described as terra incognita. When marking out the boundaries of their new territories, Europeans negotiators frequently resorted to drawing straight lines on the map, taking little or no account of the myriad of traditional monarchies, chiefdoms and other African societies that existed on the ground. Nearly one half of the new frontiers imposed on Africa were geometric lines, lines of latitude and longitude, other straight lines or arcs of circles. In some cases, African societies were rent apart: the Bakongo were partitioned between French Congo, Belgian Congo and Portuguese Angola; Somaliland was carved up between Britain, Italy and France. In all, the new boundaries cut through some 190 culture groups. In other cases, Europe\u2019s new colonial territories enclosed hundreds of diverse and independent groups, with no common history, culture, language or religion. Nigeria, for example, contained as many as 250 ethno-linguistic groups\u2026 Kingdoms that had been historically antagonistic to one another, such as Buganda and Bunyoro in Uganda, were linked into the same colony. In the Sahel, new territories were established across the great divide between the desert regions of the Sahara and the best of tropical forests to the south \u2013 Sudan, Chad and Nigeria \u2013 throwing together Muslim and non-Muslim peoples in latent hostility. As the haggling in Europe over African territory continued, land and peoples became little more than pieces on a chessboard. \u2018We have been giving away mountains and rivers and lakes to each other, only hindered by the small impediment that we never knew exactly where they were,\u2019 Britain\u2019s prime minister, Lord Salisbury, remarked sardonically to a London audience. Britain traded the North Sea island of Heligoland with the Germans for Zanzibar, and parts of northern Nigeria with the French for fishing rights off Newfoundland. France exchanged parts of Cameroon with Germany in return for German recognition of the French protectorate over Morocco. By the time the Scramble for Africa was over, some 10,000 African polities had been amalgamated into forty European colonies and protectorates. Thus were born the modern states of Africa.\u201d To be continued. Related",

        "title": "2019 intrigues and cynicism: Nigerians beware",
        "author": "Tabia Princewill",
        "text": "By Tabia Princewill There are two kinds of cynicism currently making the rounds in Nigeria. The first and arguably the most dangerous, comes from politicians (those under the PDP banner in particular) who believe that Nigerians are so gullible, so easily manipulated that they would vote back into power a party that was plagued by unresolved corruption scandals for most of its 16 years at the helm of affairs. I was disappointed, during a conversation with some young people, to hear that the standard is so low that some people don\u2019t seem to mind that those who propose to lead them have little to no integrity and have been alleged to steal from them. The PDP can afford to be cynical because it knows that a sizeable portion of the population still doesn\u2019t quite understand how corruption impacts the economy. There is still no resolution to the allegation that during former President Jonathan\u2019s tenure alone 55 individuals allegedly stole over N1.34 trillion. Imagine what $6.2 billion could have done for this country if properly applied. Would we have known recession? Would the naira have crashed the way it did if such huge sums had been invested in our economy rather than wasted? The PDP\u2019s recently concluded national convention seemed so detached from reality, it appeared to have been advertising the successes of some other party, in some other country. How dare the PDP gloat, when for 16 years it was incapable of giving Nigerians power, roads, affordable housing, decent education, running water or any of the social amenities taken for granted in countries as small as Ghana or Benin Republic. All of those suspected looters who initially fled to London or other parts of the world, or who kept a low profile out of fear of Buhari, are increasingly gaining their confidence back. Former Presidents who failed woefully and who seemingly presided over some of the worst looting this country has ever seen, still have the gall to comment, when the court cases and investigations surrounding their tenures are too many to number. This cynicism, this belief that Nigerians\u2019 often bemoaned short-term memory will soon take over, shows they take us all for fools. The second form of cynicism, which I believe is the most dangerous of all, is the hopelessness of the average Nigerian, encouraged by some segments of the media and their backers whom the status quo profits. Nigerians were able to vote out an unsatisfactory leader, yet, the promised change still seems far off: the temptation to give up on ourselves and our country is the psychological premise that permits our underdevelopment. Politicians take advantage of our apathy, we mustn\u2019t allow it. Interestingly, a form of naivet\u00e9 seems to exist in the APC, in parallel with the PDP\u2019s cynicism. Some of President Buhari\u2019s aides believe that his \u201cpopularity\u201d is enough to secure his re-election. They don\u2019t seem to realise or understand that Nigerians today are different. The 2015 election did something radical for the voters\u2019 psyche: he saw that it was possible for an incumbent to lose an election. It would be a grave mistake for anyone to take the Nigerian voter for granted, even when he or she is provided with an incentive. In today\u2019s Nigeria, voters have been known to say they will take the money and vote as their conscience dictates. Moreover, without a resolution to the scandals which have plagued some of his appointees, President Buhari will find it difficult to convince Nigerians about the sincerity of his fight against corruption: first impressions count. Neither does it help that high profile cases were either lost, dropped or remain pending. His lacklustre cabinet, many of whom haven\u2019t shown the zeal to perform which Nigerians expected, is also a foremost issue. All of these facts have given the PDP the confidence to speak out in public again, even after so many of its top members have been indicted or named in one corruption case or the other. What a sad day for Nigeria when those who brought it to its knees are comfortable enough to act like all is forgotten. One has to wonder just how much President Buhari\u2019s illness affected his time in office. Otherwise, nothing makes sense. His cabinet failed him. We can only but guess why or under whose influence they were chosen, and then the question of how a man of Buhari\u2019s stature could be influenced to that extent comes up again. We are living in a political climate where very little makes sense. The impression that nothing is working, that everything is at a standstill has been allowed to fester, the momentum and the good will from 2015 is gone. Buhari allowed himself to be used by people who it seems just needed another political job or appointment. They didn\u2019t mean well for him or this country, they only saw him as the next phase of their career. Amaechi recently told the government to stop blaming Jonathan, Okorocha has rated the APC performance as low;so many have acted as if they weren\u2019t a part of the APC and didn\u2019t have a means of making a difference if they so wished. The PDP claims it is expecting more \u201creturnees\u201d, more former PDP governors etc., Buhari banked on the fickle nature of politicians rather than investing in his relationship with Nigerians, which he could have done with the right team communicating his achievements and the right people leading his key ministries. How terrible for him and for Nigeria. Atiku recently said the APC is the \u201cenemy of Nigeria\u201d, and called on all governors who left PDP to return so they can \u201crebuild Nigeria\u201d. But wasn\u2019t that why they all claimed they left PDP in the first place, to \u201crebuild\u201d the country? Most of our politicians have proven that their actions are not in our interest: their self-serving nature is second to none. Nigerians are hopefully wiser now, more discerning. We expected miracles from APC, we hoped for wonders to be accomplished in four short years: we wanted to reap where we did not sow. We gave in to euphoria rather than focus on the certainties of planning. We\u2019ve always given up at the wrong times, supported or made excuses for the wrong people, defended evil because it affected someone else. Now we\u2019re paying for it: our finances are strained, we\u2019re struggling to fund our budgets. What did we choose to do as a nation when the price of oil was so high? Where is all that money now? I perfectly understand the impatience of the many who are poor or disenfranchised and to whom the origin of our current situation is mere semantics. But that is precisely the issue: the masses have been encouraged to treat discussions of our problems as \u201cbig grammar\u201d, something above their heads. We have little or no social activists capable of explaining why the fight against corruption is so important to our national life. When the poor were getting poorer because social services were collapsing and huge sums were leaving our economy, the middle classes looked away. We only began to care when we too were affected and the rich began to hoard their benefits and the poor were so ignorant of their rights that our leaders got away with murder. Nigerians are rightfully angry but let\u2019s not succumb, yet again, to cynicism and manipulation. Population growth The Federal Government raised the alarm over Nigeria\u2019s population growth which begs the question. What do we have to offer all these people? It isn\u2019t enough to tell young people that they are the key to a corruption-free Nigeria: What sort of future is on offer? Without answers, people will keep migrating or committing all sorts of crimes. Abacha loot It\u2019s tragic that the World Bank and the Swiss government believe that without supervising Nigeria\u2019s use of the funds, they will be looted again. How did we allow ourselves, over the years, to be taken over by mediocre leadership? How were we bribed into silence? Related",

Nigerians can decide how to be choosing their leaders even without political party, even though it is not done in any other country, let Nigeria be the first country to use that process to choose their leaders. Because in political party system that we are practicing presently here, the masses are to vote the people presented to them by political parties whether they are qualified or not and the same political party will be dictating for the leader whether he like it or not. Instead of piloting the affairs of the people with our constitution they will be leading us with their party ideology.</p>",

        "author": "Tonnie Iredia",
        "text": "By Tonnie Iredia Nigeria\u2019s former Vice President during the Obasanjo administration, Alhaji Atiku Abubakar has formally declared his intention to contest the 2019 Presidential election. Atiku made his intention known last Tuesday in Port Harcourt, Rivers state. Whereas the declaration is legally premature, Atiku showed great ability in his articulation of what is wrong with the polity and how he intends to bring the nation back to greater heights. Some people may have no option than to consider him for their vote because he has reached out meaningfully. Another person whose subsisting interest in the 2019 presidential election cannot be ignored is Sule Lamido, immediate past governor of Jigawa state and one-time Foreign Affairs Minister. Those who know him especially Jigawa citizens can hardly dispute his astute pragmatism as a leader, administrator and state builder. While Atiku and Lamido can easily be assessed because they had held political offices in the past, it is heartwarming to hear of the emergence of someone that is obviously an outstanding professional, Kingsley Moghalu a former Deputy Governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria, CBN. He too has been explaining why he considers himself well positioned to facilitate the nation\u2019s rapid growth and development. With Moghalu\u2019s intimidating credentials, why should patriots not adopt a strong brand? Of course many more politicians both at federal and state levels are likely to join the race soon. Some of them are probably waiting for the approved time for doing so. It is therefore likely that for 2019, we shall have not just more aspirants but qualitative ones. It is hoped however that such other aspirants will change the old narrative of Nigerian politics by presenting to the nation not only promises but how they intend to implement them, that is, a detailed plan of action on which they can be held accountable. They must also be persuasive enough for us all to see them as having enough capacity for the office they aspire to hold. In other words, they need to transparently display cognate ability. But unfortunately, current trends do not appear to show that the narrative will change. Already, there are many people who give the impression that as law abiding citizens, they would not beat the gun, yet scores of their supporters are all over the place ostensibly acting on their behalf thereby underscoring the lack of capability of their principals. A painful one is the group made up of persons who are busy renting crowds that are begging them to consider running for one post or the other. If the truth must be told, a strong patriotic and visionary leader does not need to be persuaded to serve society. Rather, the urge ought to evolve as a call to service from within the self. We therefore hope that at the appropriate time such leaders would clearly assure us that we are not as before dealing with reluctant candidates. Except that is the case, it is quite costly allowing any person who is unprepared for an office to contest and win elections with the help of considerations that are different from the personal urge and commitment to serve. It is astonishing that even incumbents who are advantaged have continued to take their people for a ride. How else can we explain the trend whereby organized supporter-groups are pointing at imaginary roads and other projects built by their hirers as if we are blind and need to be shown roads built in front of our houses? A second layer is outgoing incumbents that are imposing anointed candidates on the people. In Ekiti State, the current Deputy Governor, Kolapo Olusola-Eleka would be the candidate of the ruling Peoples\u2019 Democratic Party ONLY because that is the wish of the outgoing governor, Ayodele Fayose. In other words, neither the party nor the people of the state can vouch for the capacity of the anointed aspirant. Because our political class does not seem to believe in the efficacy of personal qualities for getting into such highly placed leadership positions, other interested Ekiti politicians including a strong voice like Senator Biodun Olujimi have been shoved aside by a stroke of the pen. In Imo state, the out-going governor, Rochas Okorocha is set to impose one Uche Nwosu as his successor. From all that is coming out of the state there are two known qualities of the said governor\u2019s preferred aspirant namely: a) he is humble and b) he is the incumbent governor\u2019s son in law. Okorocha has himself publicly added a third justification which is that Imo is not the only state where governors are supporting their relations to succeed them. While it is wrong for people to object to Nwosu\u2019s candidacy only because of his relationship with Okorocha, it is despicable that he is being imposed only for that reason The pain in this approach of imposing people on others is that the political class is making politics the obvious area where Nigeria has made no progress since independence. Each time we have any opportunity whatsoever to determine who gets what in Nigeria, the wrong persons are drafted in, only to produce disastrous consequences. During \u201cthe bow and go\u201d Senate of David Mark, one nominee for the post of Minister was confirmed without clearance. On assumption of office, he supervised a routine recruitment exercise in one of his Parastatals that led to the death of fellow citizens. Strangely, the then Senators threatened to summon the Minister who only did what he liked because he was given a blank cheque by the same Senate that failed to stop him from attaining a position above his capacity. It is perhaps the same explanation that makes favoured candidates justify their positions by claiming to have attended schools which were not in existence at the time they were allegedly there. It is therefore time for Nigerians to realize that election is a game in which stakeholders ought to field their best teams. Indeed, for 2019, it would be wrong to support those that are imposed through endorsements. Instead, we need to look out for men and women of vision that can take us beyond how it used to be. We want leaders that will work for the nation and not those that are good at articulating excuses. We need a third force by whatever name called that can put a halt to the recycling of political cousins in the two main political parties that are similarly propelled by same goal- personal interest. Except we search and search thoroughly and refuse to vote for those who have always failed, things can hardly improve. Related",

        "author": "Yinka Odumakin",
        "text": "By Yinka Odumakin IF Nigeria goes through the 2019 elections and it is unable to put in Aso Rock its Zayed to start the rebuilding process of a badly fractured polity, it should be time to sing the nunc dimittis of the greatest tragedy of the modern era: a country with very great potentials that never was. The United Arab Emirates is celebrating this year the centenary of Sheik Zayed bin Sultan who was born in 1918 and became the Ruler of Abu Dhabi in 1966. He later led the unification of the then seven separate sheikdoms into a federation and became the first president of the newly formed country and transformed it into one of the most advanced countries in the world over his 33-year reign. Fondly called \u201cBaba Zayed\u201d by his people, he was the youngest of the four sons of his father. He was just seven when he began to sit in his father\u2019s majlis royal court listening to the conversations around him and asking questions. As it was a turbulent period, Sheik Sultan was concerned for the safety of his family and sent Zayed and two of his brothers to Al again with their mother in 1926. The father\u2019s prescience was not unfounded as he was assassinated shortly afterwards. From the age of eight, Zayed lived with his maternal grandfather and among the Bedouin tribespeople of Al Ain where he learned about the day-to-day issues facing the local Bedouin.He was very much of the tribe,enduring the hardships that were part and parcel of desert lifestyle. From there he developed his own characteristics, including tact, diplomacy, patience and a belief in peace and cooperation. Where modern leaders learn the necessary techniques for success at University or business school, Zayed\u2019s skills were self-taught as he did not benefit from a formal education. His only schooling came from reading the Quran and observing his father and grandfather in their majlis. It was Sheik Shakbut bin Sultan his elder brother who saw how influential and well respected he was that first appointed him as the Ruler\u2019s Representative in Al Ain in 1946. He used that position to bring many POSITIVE changes in the region which forever changed the lives of the people. In no time, Al Anin had a school and bustling markets while Abu Dhabi looked increasingly moribund despite the potential wealth from oil discovery in 1958. Sheik Shakbunat was unwilling to use the money to finance development and modernisation programmes. In 1966,the Al Nahyan family concluded that a change of leadership was needed for progress. Sheik Shakkbut accepted the family\u2019s decision and stepped down on 6 August in favour of his younger brother,Sheik Zayed, a change widely acclaimed by the people of Abu Dhabi. Sheik Zayed hit the ground running setting about a programme of accelerated development, drawing up a budget for the first time in Abu Dhabi\u2019s history and implementing what he saw as badly needed spending on sewerage, hospitals, clinics, housing, education and a new harbour. He announced a five-year strategic plan in 1968 covered a whole gamut. He had incredible foresight and always thought of what was best for his people. He gave each adult male three pieces of land-to build a home, a commercial property and an industrial workshop.He was committed to the investment of the people in Abu Dhabi\u2019s future success . Just 18 months after Zayed became Ruler, the British announced their plan to completely withdraw from the Gulf by 1971.Britain provided their only military protection and it was hoped that the seven emirates of the Trucial Coast would form a federation with Bahrain and Qatar. Zayed accepted the British decision and set about building a new federation. Even when old rivalries made it look as though a federation would be impossible,he believed that unity was the best way of delivering economic and social progress for the whole region.His first step was to reach an agreement with Dubai that they would form a federation of two emirates even if ultimately the others chose not to join.To achieve this, he made concessions on the maritime boundary between the two. Discussions continued with the other five emirates and Bahrain and Qatar but the latter duo had a different agenda by declaring themselves as independent states. Zayed worked patiently with the other five to establish a smaller federation. As the clock ticked down to British withdrawal in 1971 and things still hazy, Zayed asked the other rulers a question Nigeria has been dodging in all its years of jaded existence: Do you want unity?They all said yes. And the details were worked out in just FOUR MONTHS with Ras Al Khaimah opting out over some of the conditions on representation. On 2 December 1971, the United Arab Emirates was born and included emirates of Abu Dhabi, Dubai, Sharjah, Ajman, Umm Al Quwain and Fujairah. It was a victory for the patience and vision of Sheik Zayed.Ras Al Khaimah joined the UAE just nine weeks after completing the Union. Zayed was a leader whose foray to other lands was not for buying properties or medical tourism .Hear him \u201cI visited the UK in 1953 for for the first time and was impressed by what I saw. I dreamed to make Abu Dhabi one day as beautiful and green. After that I visited the U.S, Lebanon, Iraq, Egypt, Syria, India and Iran, I had great ambitions to make my country their equal.I accompanied my brother to Paris and visited it\u2019s great museums,hospitals and universities.I dreamed one day to have similar institutions in my country and to put an end to poverty and sickness\u201d. The desert has become a world -acclaimed reference of development and tourist destination today for that vision. While Nigeria lies in the midst of ruins with all its oil wealth, Zayed showed contrast as he had a clear view of how oil money should be spent. He said Allah did not bestow this wealth on him alone, although he was entrusted with the nation\u2019s money. He always held himself accountable and once said \u201cI invite you to see for yourselves where oil money goes in this country.This money is directed to paving roads, building hospitals, expanding water and electricity services, constructing schools, so they will be available to every citizen\u201d. His leadership was in contrast to that of governments in many societies of which Nigeria sorely stands out. He created for his citizens a social structure where they benefit not only from massive investment in infrastructure but also from free land,free loans, free education, free health care, subsidised utilities,well-paid jobs and generous state pensions.This system has endured for five decades now with adjustments here and there. He died in 2009 but he lives on in the hearts of his people. Apart from electing a leader who can stop the wanton killings going on in the land today,Nigeria needs a leader like Zayed in 2019 who has a mission and vision,who is a unifier but not unitarist. A leader who can give it a fresh start and in the words of Max Siollun ,\u201da reconstructive surgeon and not a bulldozer\u2019. The search begin\u2026 \u2026Not -too -old -to -run and not-too-young to follow A PRACTICAL joke played out last week at the signing of the \u201cNot -too-young-to-run\u201d Bill where some age mates of Macron(French President) were brought out like ballot boxes are used around here to give the appearance of democratic elections. As President Buhari signed the law, he admonished the young people to be ready to run but after he must have finished his own second term in 2023. The \u201ctomorrow \u201d has been delayed by another four years making them leaders of next tomorrow. I learnt from ancient wisdom at very little age that there is a realm in which tomorrow never comes.The Yoruba put it succinctly:Ola o kin tan laye(tomorrow never ends). I remember how ACN,one of the legacy parties elected a 62-year old as its \u201cYouth Leader\u201d some years back as a loud statement that the youths cannot even manage their own affairs. It would take \u201clazy youth\u201d who lack the capacity to google who signed the bill for the generations of Zik, Awo, Balewa, Enahoro et al to become household names in their late 20s and early 30s. Or if one Baba called all those who governed Nigeria in their thirties to any signing ceremony. Until the young people of Nigeria take seriously one of the sayings of Jagaban that \u201cpower is not served a la carte\u201d their years of shouting \u201cSai Baba\u201d on social media have just started counting ! \u2026Nigeria, you are not a country! LOOK at the yellow bucket in the picture below. As we boarded an Emirates\u2019 flight on Sunday 27 April from MMIA, it was rainy heavily and water was dripping on passengers with that bucket placed to collect the remaining. I thought it was a makeshift. I returned seven days after and it was raining and the bucket was still there for the same purpose. Some heads are definitely not working here. While Nigerians complained loudly at the sight, foreigners just passed shaking their heads.In this age and time? It\u2019s a shame! Related",

        "author": "Dr Ugoji Egbujo",
        "text": "By Dr Ugoji Egbujo The PDP needs salvation. It can start by changing its image. It cannot allow the perception that it is the party that is soft on corruption linger. It cannot be the party preaching \u201call have sinned\u201d. It must seek righteousness. But in the meantime it must find some vocal Pharisees. It has too many sin soaked and resigned publicans in the front pews. It should be the party now preaching not just the rule of law but the virtues of accountability and probity. Holier-than- thou is an indispensable disposition for any party in the opposition in a corruption infested country. The PDP got power on a platter. And lived the life of one on whose laps success fell fortuitously. They thought themselves exceptional and gloried in that which chance bestowed on them. They thought they were the greatest party in Africa. They predicted their longevity in power because they were \u2018ordained\u2019 to rule . In a religious society, God is in everything. Even rigged elections. The electorate was poor, hungry and desperate. And even Bishops did not put themselves beyond being hired and bought . With hands in the public till and hearts filled with impunity, politicians\u2019 fantasies mushroomed. They had so much to share and they preoccupied themselves with frivolities. Everyone flocked to the umbrella for shade , for succor, for vanity. Disenchanted members always came back before they had finished leaving. No one wanted to be drenched by the rain. Opposition politics in any African country is fraught with risks and frustrations. State institutions, perennially weak and pliable, cannot distinguish between the ruling party and the state. But the tomorrow not foreseen came too soon. The public managed to get fed up with familiar corruption and wastefulness. Crude oil prices slipped in time to make PDP\u2019s prodigality especially conspicuous and repugnant. Amiable and generous PDP. Sixty was devalued to sixteen, presumptuousness was cut to size, they lost . And relinquished power \u201cin the interest of national unity\u201d Life in the opposition was always going to be difficult for a butter fed and gluttonous party. Sheltered since birth, the PDP was not accustomed to lack. Opposition politics is grueling but will test the sinews in times of economic recession. That which had lubricated frictions and soothed chafed nerves is now in very short supply. And that which converted potential criminal prosecutions to family affairs has been relinquished. The PDP must endure. Tantrums won\u2019t help. And dirty linens must be washed indoors. Such spectacles are not good entertainment now. Nigeria is awash with comedians and PDP has vigilant enemies in high places. No one is interested in the similarity between Sheriff and Shugaba nor in what took Fani Kayode to exile in Ghana. The party must rebuild. \u2018Agberos\u2019 are good, they do necessary dirty works and throw vulgar darts. But the party needs respectable leaders. Governors who talk before thinking and spend more time beating chests than reading cannot be the face of the greatest political party in Africa. A national party cannot be mistaken for the Avengers of the Niger Delta. The sins of the past have been exhumed and trouble has been visiting and liquefying hearts. The witch hunting cries have not scared the hawks. Rather than allow the picking off of the chicks one after the other, a collective bargain could yield a life saving political compromise. And that is why Jonathan should leave Cote D\u2019ivoire. And sit over his chicks like a mother hen. A stitch in time can save a frayed umbrella. Let the messiah who saved 170 million by a single phone call , be a good herdsman. Let him take responsibility for all that has happened and stand for his herd. Let him concede egregious mistakes were made. He can attribute them to the perverted political traditions that have existed since Lord Lugard. The public will understand the \u2018all have fallen short of glory\u2019 argument if it comes with substantial atonement. After all Abacha still has his rank and his name on national monuments. Is there any thief in any Nigerian prison who took more than him? He collected more than all of them put together. A comprehensive restitution in exchange for amnesty can be arranged. This is Nigeria, a land of possibilities. Prime Minister Cameron can say what he likes. This country needs all the money it can lay its hands on, borrowed, returned, repatriated. And the PDP needs fresh air. And Jonathan\u2019s supporters do not want their idol defaced. PDP\u2019s survival is in Nigeria\u2019s interest. One party democracy is a dangerous proposition. And not even one party led by a General who dashes after thieves like a vigilante. So those who have started procuring court injunctions from their local government areas and factionalizing the PDP are unpatriotic. Conflicts are natural but things must not fall apart. It\u2019s good the party has retained a firm grip on the South-South and South-East states. These grips are important. Political parties in Nigeria are funded with monies siphoned from government coffers. Lagos played such a crucial role for the opposition in yesteryears . It could be the turn of Rivers now. If it ends well, then its well. There will be difficult times ahead . Elaborate democratic rituals should be circumscribed. The era when delegates converged in Abuja with great expectations and marched around the eagle square like contractors are gone. There was a reason why the defunct AC did things in-house, most times. Soon, the PDP will learn that internal party democracy is good but it\u2019s a luxury the opposition cannot always afford. A captain with a whip is needed. The ship has too many captains, with loud mouths. It\u2019s good to have a base. And it\u2019s not an abomination to stoke the vulgar passions that fire the base from time to time. Politics has ugly sides. So bigotry and prejudice against the north may serve some useful purpose in cementing that base. But a proclamation of antipathy towards the Hausa-Fulani will only make the PDP a regional party. So they can afford occasional incendiary outbursts from the likes of Fani Kayode but they must find leaders who will rebuild their northern appeal. And their prestige. The PDP will not return to national reckoning if its leaders publicly preach hate and demonize the Muslim North. Cattle herdsmen have committed unspeakable atrocities but the PDP leaders in the south should not champion the inflammation of ethnic tensions. A former senate president shed tears after Agatu and declared that the herdsmen came to punish those who voted for him in a rerun election. He privatized a national tragedy. Rumours can be sweet but governors do not have the luxury of barbers to peddle rumours publicly. Buhari is not synonymous with the Muslim North. PDP can pillory Buhari . But must court the ordinary Hausa- Fulani , like the Ijaw. They were once so cosmopolitan. Now, their spokesmen are freely fanning embers of secessions. Why do they now sound so suicidal? They may not like the defunct AC but they must learn a bit of it\u2019s politics in opposition. That party didn\u2019t promote ethnic or religious chauvinism. Didn\u2019t stoke fires. Didn\u2019t malign other groups even when it was a sectional champion. It had an eye on the future. Except PDP be born-again it shall not go back to Aso Rock. Related",

        "author": "Kabiru M. Gwangwazo",
        "text": "By Kabiru M. Gwangwazo Since the return of General Buhari in good health last year the political atmosphere has been revving up ahead of the mother of all battles in 2019. Though the President has not yet confirmed he is contesting a second term, his usual \u201cbody language\u201d when elections are around the corner suggests he has already thrown his hat into the ring. President Buhari I am of the group who still believe our same old GMB is the best option yet on the scene. But sadly, his \u201cbody language\u201d is used to lure him into many ill-advised political decisions and engagements. On elongation of the party executives\u2019 tenure the suggestion is that it was done in the General\u2019s interest, that it was the safest option for him to reclaim the ticket of the APC for 2019. This is not minding the many inadequacies of the exco at all levels; of which GMB, his handlers and state governors are the principal architects. On their retention, albeit unconstitutionally, GMB ended up spiting a broad swathe of his own supporters, especially that the extension of tenure affected all levels, down to LGs and wards. This discounts the many aggrieved APC activists and stalwarts in the North locked out of government and party since 2015. The elongation rubbished the powerful Tinubu Reconciliation Committee, a committee in which hope had been invested by most aggrieved party men and women, despite the lack of clarity of its membership. Even as a one-man committee, Tinubu had given hope that there would be a fair ear given for a genuine politically-rooted reconciliation. He has received numerous solicited and unsolicited advise over the few weeks he had been on the turf as chief arbiter of APC\u2019s many troubles. Yet, another major ill-chewed decision that Mr. President has been lured into is the rejection of the National Assembly proposal on reordering of the election sequence. There is no compelling reason for the Presidency to spike the Bill. He should best let the system work and correct itself; that is where there are mistakes to correct. INEC has been pulled into this, working itself into a frenzy to interpret words of the constitution that are not explicit. Only God knows what the judiciary is expected to do when the matter is escalated to it. On the order of elections, in 1979, the sequence had the President as last on the queue. It was the desperation of an unpopular NPN Shagari government that reordered it, making Presidential first for the \u201cbandwagon\u201d rigging needed to return the NPN. That was an unpopular civilian government that lasted only three months. It unfortunately led to the putsch by GMB and his co-coupists in 1983. In IBB\u2019s 3rd Republic, first were LG elections, then state polls. Presidential was kept for last before IBB stepped aside. Next is this 4th Republic. Elections began with LGs, then states. Atiku Abubakar as PDP Governor-elect of Adamawa was promoted Vice President to General Obasanjo, leaving the state to Deputy, Bonnie Haruna. In 2003 the PDP had to reorder the sequence for fear of massively popular GMB riding the crest of the pro-Shariah movement in the North. The Presidential election and its weird bandwagon reminiscent of the unpopular NPN days was again invoked. The first set of polls in 2003 thus had President and National Assembly on the same day. Governors had their day later. It is common knowledge Governors lured GMB into an ill-advised muscle flexing on the election sequence with the bait of his own election. By doing so, they are tacitly saying the General is now afraid of the mass base he has, that he needs governors to \u201cbandwagon\u201d victory for him. The reality is that it is governors and other aspirants that are neither here nor there who still need the cover of the GMB SAK bandwagon The fear though is they may be thinking the unthinkable: rigging, with all its consequences. And it will have consequences, no doubt. The apparent rebuff of the Tinubu Committee by the tenure elongation is another area where GMB has been so lured by the bait of re-election. What is more, there are all kinds of suppositions and analyses on what is actually on ground with regards to the politics of APC states and their tonnes of crises. Most of the analyses on the APC crises so far focus on areas that have received the most media hype, even when the facts are not always as sold on the media. One that I read on an online post this week pointed to some 14 fluid states that APC may lose. That post appears generally plausible, even if the suggestion that wherever APC loses, PDP will be the beneficiary is a fatuous assumption with little scientific basis. A more rational assessment though should identify other parties in the states likely to benefit from APC\u2019s loss, especially if Tinubu, the APC Chief Reconciler is made to fail. Tinubu is no doubt the key to resolution of the APC crises. After he finishes his assignment, Tinubu should be made Chairman of the GMB 2019 Presidential Campaign. Kwankwaso should be made Vice-Chairman to pull in the areas he has made inroads into in the North, while Amaechi remains DG of the Campaign. Tinubu as Vice President will ensure Yorubaland votes to make up for likely losses in the North. And there will be losses whether the reconciliation works or not. APC will not get votes of most Christians in the North. This is obvious with the ongoing manipulation of the security situation in the Middle Belt. With this, the electoral value of Osinbajo is, to say the least, weak. After all, like General Buhari said in his 2018 New Year Address, Yorubas are more conscious of their ethnic identity rather than the religious consideration of other ethnic groups. The 2019 poll will surely be hard-fought. Many voters overly enthusiastic in 2015 may not participate unless more work is done on them. APC voters in the core North who trooped out in 2015 did so to save themselves from the threat of BH let loose by a loose, or worse, complicit PDP central government may not feel the same urge in 2019. In Kano and Bauchi, incumbents at all levels are at serious risk of losing, though not necessarily to PDP. Teams of core Buharists sidelined in states and at the centre will surely work with other alienated APC members and those who lose out in PDP to form the next governments of Bauchi and Kano, and in many other crises-infested states too. On voter demographics in Kano, the Buhari group is made up of believers in good governance. The Sharia-inclined mass base of the Talakawa political vision of NEPU and PRP of Malam Aminu Kano is what Buhari inherited in Kano and all states of the North. This mass base of disenchanted Buharists have been onlookers in the government and APC. That is also what obtains in many of the 2019 fluid states. Such activists will determine what happens in Kano. For sure, like most analysts suggest, Kano in 2019 is certainly fluid. But the APC problem here is not only about Kwankwaso or Ganduje or even PDP, even when both Kwankwaso and Ganduje are all PDP Graduates of APC. Related",

        "author": "Yinka Odumakin",
        "text": "By Yinka Odumakin THE Governor of Kaduna State, Mallam Nasiru-el-Rufai has been in the news lately over the outcome of the competence test he administered on teachers in the state with about 22,000 teachers failing Primary Four test questions. It must be pointed out though that the exercise is not novel to Kaduna,it was carried out in Kwara years back when the current Senate President, Dr. Bukola Saraki was Governor and the National Publicity Secretary of APC, Mr. Bolaji Abdullahi as his Education Commissioner. The outcome was as disastrous as the latest case in Kaduna. But unlike Saraki who decided to retrain the woeful teachers,El-Rufai has decided to do away with the failed teachers and recruit new ones from some outer space may be.The Governor in an interview with Vanguard Newspaper summed up the issue as follows: \u201cUnqualified teachers entered the system because the recruitment of teachers was politicised. The local government council chairmen and other senior politicians and bureaucrats saw teaching as a dumping ground for their thugs, supporters and other unqualified persons. Teachers were employed at local government level without adherence to standards. In many instances, no examinations or interviews were conducted to assess the quality of recruits. Political patronage, nepotism and corruption became the yardsticks, thus giving unqualified persons a way in. Teaching jobs were given as patronage to those connected to politicians and bureaucrats. The Kaduna State Executive Council has approved the recruitment of 25,000 primary school teachers. Recruitment notices have already been advertised by the Kaduna State Universal Basic Education Board, SUBEB. This time around, there would be standardised tests for the recruits and a further training programme before the new teachers take over the classrooms. No unqualified person will scale through. And we will vet certificates very closely and very often. The future of our children is so important that we will not take chances. We will be vigilant in ensuring that only good people teach in our public schools.\u201d We should be clapping for this governor but for the pin on his ballon by Zaria NUT chairman, Mr. Yahaya Abass that the \u201caccidental public servant\u201d is in no way different from those he accused of turning teaching into a \u201cdumping ground\u201d as some of the scripts he displayed belonged to carpenters and messengers he converted to teachers when he assumed office as governor. Hear him: \u201cWe were disturbed when we saw those scripts. This was why we investigated.\u201d \u201cYou may recall that el-Rufai has directed the conversion of all redundant staff in the local education authorities to teachers. Among those converted were messengers, carpenters, labourers, security personnel among others. We were made to write the exam in question with those people. \u201cOur investigation revealed that candidate number EKUB 0059 displayed by el-Rufai was a carpenter in Kubau local government before he was forcefully taken to class. Candidate number EKUB 2839 was a messenger in the same local government. Ethnic cleansing claims \u201cIf you remember all attempts to draw the attention of the government on the implication of their action fell on deaf ears. \u201cAgain, those who marked this exam are the illiterates, because even these candidates with their limited knowledge have answered some of the questions correctly but they were marked wrong.\u201d No less damning is the \u201cethnic cleansing\u201d accusation by the Southern Kaduna Christian Leaders Association in a statement endorsed by Bishop Simon Peters and Bishop Joseph Bagobiri that when the first test given were passed by more teachers, another one was administered wherein the pass mark was put at 75%. Retirees and deceased people are alleged to be many on the \u201cpass list\u201d. They also said that out of the 21,780 teachers who failed the second test, 21,780 were from Southern Kaduna representing 82% of those to be sacked. They added that when Col. Hameed Ali sacked 30,000 protesting civil servants from the state in 1997 more than 80% were from the zone! While Kaduna is sorting itself out on this cankerworm, there is no denying the fact that standards have fallen in every aspect of our national life. These days you see university graduates who cannot write a correct sentence even to save their own lives. Most drivers on the road cannot read or understand traffic signs. Doctors cannot diagnose patients properly. The late Chief Gani Fawehinmi was treated for pneumonia for years by one of the \u201cbest\u201d hospitals in Lagos until real hospital in London discovered he had cancer. Then, it was too late. Quacks have taken over everywhere. But there is a profession in Nigeria today where the quacks and incompetent have a paradise. And it is where everything rises and falls. 95% of \u201cleaders \u201d in our clime today will woefully fail Primary One leadership tests if administered. But they are not afraid now as leadership is the only job in the land where no background checks is carry out. This is why the incompetent, certificate forgers, criminals and crooks populate our leadership. Senator Nuhu Aliyu on the floor of the Senate in 2008 and screamed \u201cMr. President,there are criminals on this floor.\u201dThe former AIG of police saw an armed robber he once handcuffed sitting as a \u201cdistinguished\u201d Senator in our hollow chambers! One man who has shown that he may be in the same class with the worst of Kaduna teachers is the current Sports Minister, Mr. Solomon Dalung. He has in the last two years been to \u201cBendel\u201d and \u201cGongola\u201d States in Nigeria. He has ensured that the money \u201che spent were well spended.\u201dHe has claimed ignorance of how our team found its way to \u201cUnited States of Nigeria.\u201d And lately \u201cArgentina is one of the clubs in Nigeria\u201d in the pathetic gaffes of our Honourable Minister! His seat is guaranteed at the Federal Executive Council tomorrow! Dysfunctional structure The truth is that Nigeria cannot make it beyond the competence and ethical content or its leaders in a warped and dysfunctional structure. And fixing Nigeria can only start with a resurrected electorate that would not allow failures to repeat classes or reproducing themselves. We cannot continue to outsource leadership to the dregs and throng prayer centres calling on God to prosper our nation. We must become like the Koreans. Korean political class is corrupt and a self-serving mess but the citizens are not. The Korean public has responded with a massive outpouring of peaceful resistance to the shenanigans of its leaders. Corruption may stalk the Korean political establishment, even the president, but the public has made very clear it will not accept that. When the Choi scandal broke out in 2016 millions of Koreans protested peacefully. On November 26, estimates suggest two million people demonstrated, a staggering 4% of the entire national population. Even overseas Koreans protested in Europe and the United States. The protests happened five weeks in a row, another astonishing feat. Mobilising millions of people for more than a month requires a deep well of public support for democracy. Further, the protests have been totally peaceful. There were no reports of assaults, robberies, and so on. The kind of social anarchy we saw during the Arab Spring protests of similar scale did not occur. The protestors even cleaned up their trash, signaling a commitment to their society even as they rejected its leadership. That rejection must start here in 2019. Like el-Rufai is poised to do with Kaduna teachers, the Nigerian electorate must be ready East, West, North and South to purge the system of the incompetent, corrupt, visionless and moribund thieving elite.The bar has to be raised.Leadership should not be the comfort zone for the scoundrels. Permissive Culture Our permissive culture have seen veteran 419ners, notorious assassins,armed robbers and allied crooks relocating into the political sphere because we don\u2019t ask where those coming into leadership are from. Someone who wants to hire a driver or house help do more background checks than we ever conduct on those who seek to lead us. Nigeria is going down the slope and indeed fast disappearing unless good men and women from all comers of Nigeria seek themselves out and congregate in a mighty force to save this republic.For long we have accepted that the cream cannot make it to the top.It is time for the force that can open up the political space for the best and the brightest in our land. Any party that requires its members to rob the bank to buy nomination forms cannot allow the best in the land to represent you.Any party whose front row is an assembly of looters and questionable characters cannot give you a clean government. It is time to take back our country . It is time for politics that adds values to our people and free them from maggots. Related",

        "title": "2019: Why opposition is silenced and clueless",
        "author": "Morenike Taire",
        "text": "By Morenike Taire While the deepening state of confusion in the country continues to drive more and more unrest in every geopolitical zone, it has also meant a deeper socio political awareness across board. APC & PDP And while this awareness does not necessarily translate to growth and development in the political sphere and in the polity in general, it does raise hopes that we can get our national compass flickering once more. This glimmer of hope begins to dim when opposition to government policies, rather than being seen as a necessary impetus for the flow of ideas, justice, fairplay and accountability, is squashed and silenced in a manner reminiscent of the most brutal military dictatorships: the darkest days in our national history. When the rule of law suffers under a military dictatorship, it is a state of affairs only to be expected. Brutal as they are, military dictators were in full control of their affairs and would hardly be sloppy in their execution of them. No one voted them in; therefore no one has any superior expectations of them. Moreso, if there is nothing else Nigerians are agreed upon, they are certainly agreed that military dictatorship is not an acceptable form of government and reject it in the very strongest terms. But when elected personnel are put in positions of power by the people to preside over the affairs of government, there are certain standards expected of them by the very people who put them in positions of power and of authority. These expectations- and perhaps trust- are violated when elected officials use this same power to squash opposing voices and make themselves the greatest enemies of free speech. It is bizarre, to say the least, that the system can be abused in the punishment of opposing voices in 2018, just as easily as it had been in 1988, with no consequences whatsoever. The lack of consequences has always been the greatest enabler of the dearth of the rule of law in our country; and consequences only happen when the opposition is as powerful, if not more powerful, than the people in authority at any particular time. This is more so in the political sphere, where the oppositions, having tasted power before, are relatively familiar with the loopholes and pitfalls in navigating the political space. It is therefore baffling that while the ranks of the opposition swells in leaps and bounds in Nigeria, there is not a concomitant swelling in the ability to provide checks and balances in the system. APGA and APC lOGO Regionally strong opposition parties such as Accord, APGA, Labour Party and SDP are particularly guilty, as their voices are rarely ever heard unless it has to do with the propagation of their politics or elections are round the corner. When any criticism of government policy is offered, it is neither thorough nor sustained. Experts in the area being criticized are rarely engaged, and superior alternatives are rarely offered. The reasons are not far-fetched and the impression clearly given to the electorates strongly suggests that the opposition is not as passionate about fixing Nigeria as it is about winning elections. Naturally, winning elections is very, very important, and is in fact the raison d\u2019etre of a political party\u2019s existence. All the party ideology in this world is of little use if political power is not harnessed in order to bestow them on the rest of us. Yet political power cannot be gained unless the proper distillation and channeling of ideas is done, as this is what will endear the electorate to their ideology. If the cart of winning elections is put before the horse of convincing the people that they have their interest at heart, why would the people give them a chance? Complex as the Nigerian political space is, it is really as simple as that. Meanwhile, chief opposition party, the PDP, has shown itself more guilty than others of putting its hunger for power before its liability to its electorates. This is probably why political pundits have declared that the party is joking in its bid not only to unseat the incumbent at the presidency but at the various State Houses as well. The party\u2019s hunger and desperation to get back power is so glaring that it has become a complete turn-off to the electorate. Yes, money politics still carries the day, but unknown to the leaders of our political parties, adversity has forced and is forcing the Nigerian electorate to become much more sophisticated, and nowhere will this be more obvious than in the 2019 general elections. Unknown to the leadership of the political parties, the criteria that will influence the electorates in 2019 will be significantly different from what they are prepared to serve. With pressure from youth groups and the young at heart as well as well as women pressure groups, the nucleus is shifting and the power dynamics are being altered significantly, but ever so subtly. Lining up a business-as-usual crowd of Northern accomplished and elite politicians as possible alternatives to the incumbent is the joke of the century. Unless the PDP does something drastic like putting forward a woman or a youthful personality, they will get the shock of their lives in 2019. No one cares anymore what the combination of the tickets is. One factor that has not changed much is that we desperately need the opposition to function in our favour but most unfortunately, we have generally been bestowed with the worst opposition possible since the beginning of the 4th Republic.

        "author": "Tabia Princewill",
        "text": "By Tabia Princewill There is no, as of yet, wide scale attempt to educate the masses as to what is going on in Nigeria today or to explain why the expected change is slow to come. Yes, individually, ministers have done their best to explain the difficulties and the challenges they\u2019ve faced but none of this appears to have pierced through the average person\u2019s consciousness because it was immediately contradicted by the loud retaliation and attacks of those who now find themselves accused of corruption and have worked hard to misinform Nigerians as well as scuttle trials and investigations. Anyone who believes corruption is not the central issue delaying this country\u2019s progress is either ignorant, in denial or part of the problem themselves: too many Nigerians benefit directly or indirectly from the current dysfunctional state of affairs to let go of their illegal advantages without a fight. Much like I said in my last article, President Muhammadu Buhari appears to have brought a knife to a gun fight: many of those around him either do not share his beliefs or his passion about making a real difference. They don\u2019t appear to have shown the sort of dedication one would expect given the magnitude of the issues which seem to have so far been treated with kid gloves. Decisively dealing with corruption (and therefore turning the economy around by making better use of our resources) requires a war-effort which should mobilise every Nigerian. The Nigerian orientation, our self-interested propensity to cut-corners in search of quick gains is yet to be tackled. The strategy to turn this country around should have links between every federal agency and ministry,which should be re-trained to work together. The system must also be purged of all those who belong to the old order, people whose corruption or insubordination hinders progress must not be allowed to remain. It\u2019s a massive effort but not one that is impossible if we can recruit and appoint, at all levels, honest, capable, detribalised Nigerians to get the job done. Sadly, the best man hardly ever gets the job in Nigeria. We prefer the services of half-baked individuals, so long as they are from our ethno-religious group. The war-effort requires constant communication with Nigerians and imaginative communication at that. Most people suffering the brunt of poverty and recession have neither the time nor the interest to read graphs and long articles on public policy. Government has also been too civil towards suspected looters, allowing them the space to spread dangerous narratives. The difficult truth for those who support this government is that it also hasn\u2019t always acted with the decisiveness necessary to quell many of the issues which now find themselves entrenched today. The story of what exactly happened to Nigeria, why we find ourselves here, and what this administration intends to do about it should have been told in digestible, engaging forms on various platforms to galvanise and maintain the interest of the youth who largely voted this government into power. There was a time when looters were afraid. Now, they barely seem to bother to hide their efforts to scuttle attempts to tame their selfish, anti-Nigeria actions. They deploy the usual tools, ethno-religious excuses, calling themselves victims of a witch-hunt due to their religion or regional affiliation. The Vice-President, Yemi Osinbajo, has done a good job of consistently discussing the issues holding Nigeria back, which should have been repeated by this government\u2019s information managers at every opportunity. In fact, rather than react to crisis, they should have directed the national conversation and made Nigerians think differently about both problems and solutions. Yes, it is impossible to convince everyone, and yes, corruption is fighting back. Hence why this administration should never have left the campaign mode: Nigerians know this country needs to change but the specifics have always eluded us, particularly those too young to remember a time when Nigeria was different and worked for all rather than a few. The sad truth is that the average Nigerian does not possess the exposure or the critical thinking to easily discern fact from fiction or truth from political manipulation, which is used to the advantage of some corrupt politicians who prey on the masses\u2019 ignorance. Vested interests are powerful and protect each other; their armies and soldiers are everywhere to defend them and to turn logic upside down in their favour. Pro-Nigeria activists (if there are many in this government is a hotly debated issue) should have been training that \u201cnew tribe\u201d of Nigerians the Vice-President often mentions. It is also a shame that the Vice-President\u2019s personal identity as a professional, his popularity, etc., have not been sufficiently used to drive home the government\u2019s points. Is there perhaps a fear that the competent deputy might have overshadowed the principal, particularly while he was away? If so, it\u2019s a shame, more so because the Vice-President\u2019s success can only but have positive effects on people\u2019s perception of the President and his entire administration. The next campaign will have to be issue based, which is to all our benefit. If the APC hopes to remain in power to finish this war against corruption, it will have to begin a process through which it renews hope and rouses our common indignation at the injustices it is trying to fix. Politicians can\u2019t use the same old playbook, not this time. 2015 was a massive shift in the Nigerian psyche; Nigerians now know they have the power to unseat a President. Electioneering will never be the same again. Atiku Abubakar The former Vice-President recently said that the level of division currently experienced in Nigeria is unprecedented. It is the usual vacuous political statement which seeks to pretend the speaker hasn\u2019t been a major political player in the past decades and should also be held accountable for whatever is happening today. It is all the more hypocritical because every administration in Nigeria has had its fair share of secessionist threats and violence due to the corruption over which many leaders have willingly supervised. Not only is violence and hate speech often sponsored, it is also as a result of government\u2019s failure to develop Nigeria and to provide its people with basic amenities. The most curious part of the former Vice-President\u2019s speech came when he said unity was better than restructuring. Wasn\u2019t he previously adamant that Nigeria wouldn\u2019t survive without restructuring? This is further proof that politicians float kites depending on what is trending and what can gain attention or support. Very few of our leaders operate with a consistent ideology or policy design. It\u2019s why we are still so underdeveloped. Yemi Osinbajo The Vice President rightly said that the quota system in use in Nigeria is detrimental to the nation\u2019s progress. I\u2019ve often said in this column that nepotism, tribalism and corruption are three sides of the same structure which keeps competent people out of public office. \u201cWhen our football teams are playing, we do not ask where the players come from because we want to win. In the same vein, if we want to win in Nigeria, we must insist on merit. We must insist on fair minded and just people in positions. That is how countries are run all over the world. It is only in this country that the first thing we do is to ask for quota system\u201d. It\u2019s a fine analogy: Without pursuing merit above all things, we\u2019re going nowhere fast in Nigeria. By now, ethno-religious origin should have become meaningless if not for political manipulation. Professor Osinbajo is one of the rare political leaders who tells it like it is. On the subject of religious leaders and corruption he said: \u201cHow many Christian leaders stood up to complain? It is my view that the Nigerian elite, religious leaders and politicians think alike when it comes to corruption and they were always very selfish playing religious and ethnic cards when it pleases them.\u201d Sad but true.

        "title": "2019: Will our votes count?",
        "author": "Tonnie Iredia",
        "text": "By Tonnie Iredia Over the years, opinion moulders and analyst have at one time or the other, found cause to make a case for free and fair elections in Nigeria. As a result, almost everyone has always harped on the need for intense voter education in the country. The term voter education simply refers to the political education of the voting population of a given community. Through it, the relevant features of an electoral system are laid bare. This includes issues such as type of election, those qualified to vote and be voted for, the number and nature of political parties as well as the strength and weaknesses of the contestants. Explaining these along with sanctions on any breach of electoral rules can properly position voters to make rational decisions. There are two issues which in a general sense, strongly support the argument in favour of voter education. First, there are people who are unaware that their political rights constitute their highest rights. Such people show no interest in politics and elections thereby inadvertently allowing wrong hands to get into government. Second, there are people who waste their ballots by wrongly handling them because they do not know how to vote. Nigeria\u2019s large illiterate population and those voting for the first time fall within this group. They need to be educated, otherwise there would be voter apathy or invalid ballots. In 1979, when the presidential system of government was introduced in the country, the average voter turn-out was about 30% \u2013 a situation that is yet to significantly improve. Similarly, many of our elections have for quite some time recorded a high figure of invalid ballots cast at each election. Against this backdrop, the daily call for voter education appears rational. Only last week, President Muhammadu Buhari himself joined in the call for better voter education. Interestingly, voter-education is a general duty which ought to receive the support of all. Political parties and their candidates are expected to take the lead because except they secure majority of valid votes they cannot win an election. Civil society groups, the media and the electoral body also have major roles to play in the subject. The latter unlike the political parties are expected to undertake public interest voter education programmes so that the electorate can be empowered to make rational decisions which can lead to the emergence of visionary leaders that can transform society. This tends to justify the call from several circles for Nigerians to ensure that they collect their permanent voters\u2019 cards (PVC) so as to effectively perform their civic duty in the forthcoming general elections. However, each time the call is made, it means different things depending on who the caller is. When the call is made by the opposition party, there is the belief that the incumbent has not done well and as such citizens need to pick up their PVCs and vote out the ruling party. Such a viewpoint is usually supported by a long list of what the government has not been able to achieve. But when the call is made by the incumbent, there is the subtle suggestion that the people need to be careful of opposition politicians who are presented as too desperate to change the government. In support of the incumbents, achievements of the government are often well publicised to encourage continuity. Voter education can therefore assist voters on which way to go. To that extent, it is a positive development which might increase not only the voting population but also the total number of votes cast at an election. But it is not hard to observe that voter education is hardly ever properly done. For example, although those who greatly need voter education are in the rural areas, most voter education schemes are urban based. In addition, they are hardly voter friendly as most jingles and enlightenment materials are presented in foreign languages which the people do not understand. Yet, ours is a cumbersome process involving hundreds of political parties and their candidates that are hard to differentiate. Besides, the programmes are not sustained for long enough to make everyone internalize the messages. What this suggests is that even if there are increases in the number of persons that now show interest in politics and elections, free and fair elections may still not be guaranteed. This is because there is no evidence that our votes which never counted in the past, may count in future. To start with, there have been reports in the past that people who didn\u2019t have PVCs were allowed to vote, just as logistic challenges have quite often disenfranchised those who have PVCs. There have also been cases where certain candidates found a way to score more votes than are available, just as thousands of votes have at different elections been recorded for election centres where voting did not hold. Under the circumstance, how can our votes count? Indeed, how can valid votes count when contrary to the rules of engagement, many voting centres are located in and around homes of powerful individuals. Top ranking politicians particularly those in the executive arm of government who control the public treasury know what to do for our votes not to count at any election. In local government elections for instance, state electoral bodies are merely a decoration as results of elections are usually compiled and released from government houses. There is no state where this has not happened. The same is true of under-age voters. They are everywhere, hence, we kicked in this column the last time the Independent National Electoral Commission, INEC, purported to be investigating allegations of under-age voters in Kano. We knew that INEC was wasting its time because voting by children in many states of the federation is one of the norms of Nigerian elections. More importantly, there are relevant societal institutions that will not let our votes count. The police for instance would always assure citizens of its readiness to combat all forms of election malpractices, yet in their full glare, a few miscreants would snatch ballot boxes at election venues. How can our votes count if some of the votes are snatched? Although, Nigeria boasts of seasoned judges, decisions in some election petitions are worrisome. The other day, one judge ruled that over voting can only occur where votes are more than the registered number of voters and not where the number of votes in a centre exceeds the number of voters duly accredited to vote at the centre. Can someone please tell me whose votes are likely to count? Related",

        "title": "$20bn idle deposits: Burden or opportunity?",
        "author": "Henry Boyo",
        "text": "By Henry Boyo As I\u2019m talking to you, $20bn is in various domiciliary accounts of individuals. Naira is our currency, why are they keeping the foreign currency? From my experience in international finance, I have never seen a country where its nationals speculate on its currency\u201d. The preceeding is an excerpt from the presentation of Dr. Joseph Nnana, CBN Deputy Governor (Financial Systems Surveillance) at a recent meeting with the Joint Appropriation Committee of the National Assembly. Naira-Dollar According to Nnana, the huge idle dollar deposits in domiciliary accounts is allegedly \u201cpart of the reason why the naira has continued to slide against the dollar\u201d. Nevertheless, Nnana warned that the CBN will not just \u201c sit down and watch the consistent fall of the Naira\u201d; consequently, he assured the committee that CBN \u201cwill embark on aggressive liquidity mop up to make the Naira stronger\u2019\u2019. Incidentally, CBN\u2019s instrument of choice for defending the Naira may seem \u2018strangely\u2019 consistent with the ceaseless advocacy for several years in this column minimise liquidity. Perhaps CBN\u2019s belated indication of the congruency of the separately prescribed solutions will dispel any misgiving about the true objective of this column. The question then, becomes why it took CBN, until reserves dwindled to compel this clearly common sense approach to Naira exchange rate management. Still, it is better late than never; the reality nonetheless, is that aggressive liquidity mop, will inevitably also increase CBN\u2019s indebtedness, as hundreds of billions Naira perceived to be in excess supply will be kept sterile, in order to create an appropriate enabling environment, with characteristic features of low inflation and interest rates that would successfully promote economic growth. Furthermore, in addition to the unusually high cost of funds borrowed, the CBN\u2019s defense of the Naira, in this fashion, will invariably also crowd out the real sector from access to the cheaper funds, which the economy urgently requires to create jobs. Evidently, the liquidity mop up projected back in Nov 2015 to soak up about N1.5Tn excess Naira supply between January-March 2016, is sadly, already failing to yield the desired positive results, as inflation and cost of funds are still inappropriately oppressive, while the Naira exchange rate remains under seige; ironically, however, despite this economic faux pas, Commercial banks will make more easy money from CBN\u2019s renewed vigor to \u2018aggressively\u2019 defend Naira!! Indeed, Nnana\u2019s palpable frustration may wrongly suggest that the persistent challenge of surplus Naira supply is instigated extraneously by some untamable alien powers. The reality, however, is that CBN, actually has sole responsibility for creating and managing money supply as near as possible to an optimal equilibrium that would induce inflation and interest rate levels, that can successfully drive inclusive growth. Unfortunately, the consistent failure of CBN\u2019s usual liquidity mop ups of Naira supply, continues to challenge consumer demand and restrain investment, with the attendant loss of potential job opportunities, while also creating impediment to successful economic diversification. Curiously, the recent revelation of $20bn idle deposits in domiciliary accounts, may, sadly suggest that the odious culture of warehousing and sterilising trillions of Naira as idle deposits in CBN vaults and records, despite the prevailing acute shortage of investible funds, may have sadly manifested in the private sector, with billions of idle non interest yielding dollar deposits, which are not also applied to any socially productive purpose; sadly despite these idle Naira and Dollar deposits, both government and private businesses, still inexplicably decry the non availability of reasonably priced funds to sustain inclusive growth. It is certainly perplexing that we should presently be considering cap-in- hand external borrowing of $4.5bn to fund the 2016 budget, when in reality, our Money Deposit Banks can easily, strategically roundtrip the idle domiciliary funds as foreign investment to reap bountiful profits from the high yield in the business of lending to government. Furthermore, the existence of idle funds is actuallyanathema to the culture and success of banking practice. Predictably, all depositors are never likely to descend on banks in one day to empty their accounts, unless there are signs of imminent distress in the sector. Thus, with the traditional predatory instinct of Nigerian banks, it is also unlikely that our undisputably \u2018smart\u2019, financial engineers would have ignored the bountiful opportunity to surreptitiously trade with their idle dollars deposits with absolutely no oversight control whatsoever from CBN. Ironically, however, the Nation\u2019s Banker may ultimately, be required to unfortunately bailout these same banks and restore international credibility to the sector, whenever banks recklessly mismanage funds or financially over reach themselves. Thus, in the light of the above distressful possibility, it would be inappropriate for CBN to stand by idly until \u2018Alarm blow\u2019 in banks before reacting to quench the fire by once again drawing down our precious national resources. Consequently, it is imperative that CBN should formally recognise the obvious danger of leaving $20bn as idle deposits in commercial banks without regulatory oversight; the apex bank must therefore quickly seize the opportunity to galvanise this latent wealth towards successfully improving the economy. Advisedly, the deposits should still remain as balances in personal domiciliary accounts with respective banks, but CBN must become formal custodian of the dollars, just as it is with Naira, so as, to minimise the risk of financial recklessness and also avoid the likely possibility of default, by commercial banks operating without regulatory oversight. Furthermore, in the same manner that CBN stipulates appropriate cash reserve ratios to influence the amount of Naira liquidity available for lending, similarly, the CBN could also formally adopt a conservative cash reserve ratio of about 50% to reduce the attendant risk and empower commercial banks to put the idle deposits positively to work in the economy with supportive rates of interest below 7%. Indeed, with such arrangement, and a monetary policy rate of say 2%, the owners of domiciliary accounts may also earn between 2-3% on their savings rather than the Zero returns they currently endure annually. Nevertheless, every holder of a domiciliary account should be allowed free access to their dollar deposits, in the same manner that owners of Naira deposits currently operate their accounts. However, forex denominated loans must be dedicated to critical industrial subsectors that can drive multifaceted opportunities in manufacturing, agriculture and commerce; furthermore, the deposits may also be applied to providing, critical, visible, life changing infrastructural projects which have expansive positive social impact. Indeed, such government loans are considered to be relatively risk free, because our National assets serve as guarantee. Thus, the erstwhile idle burdensome dollar deposits, will probably be safer in CBN\u2019s custody than to remain as unco-ordinated balances without appropriate regulatory oversight in Commercial banks.

        "text": "\u2026Victim begs Police, Nigerians for help By Luka Binniyat It was around 6am on a Sunday morning of January 27th, 2013 and the Harmattan wind was blisteringly cold and rash, Yarbung villagers recalled. The body of police corporal Mathew Jacob, 31, lay in a coffin at his grandfather\u2019s (Pa Gajere) compound in Yarbung, a normal farming community in Kachia Local Government Area, LGA of Kaduna state. Scores of mourners swathed in thick clothes circled a scattered heap of red soil dug from where the remains of the father of four would be laid to rest. His young wife, parents, relations and friends sobbed while listening and watching solemnly as the priest performed the last rituals for their son, whose end had come too soon and unexpected. Haruna Solomon Gajere His mates in Yarbung recalled of him to Saturday Vanguard, as an ebullient chap who was nice and hardworking but also enjoyed playing pranks that village lads and lasses were wont to play. Jacob\u2019s corpse had been brought to the village by three policemen and some other folks from Lagos in a bus around 9:30pm the previous Saturday evening. They said that Jacob, whose service number was 224983, had died in a motor bike accident on active service in Lagos. The policemen were the official representatives of the Nigeria Police Force to the internment of one of their own. The village was thrown into mourning. But despite the grim news and corpse that the visitors had brought, they were warmly welcomed in the village, Saturday Vanguard was told. But, it was noticed by the villagers, that the policemen and a few other visitors cared less for the variety of food served them, but opted for drinking. \u201cThey started drinking with us from the evening they arrived and after we left they drank on till late into the night,\u201d Anthony Saidu, a young man from Yarbung told our Saturday Vanguard. \u201cWe wondered how anyone could so possibly drink that much and still be able to walk around,\u201d he said. Thus, it was a surprise to those who drank with the officers the previous night to see them awake that early cold morning, standing by the grave side, managing to look smart as they prepared to bid their fallen colleague a final goodbye. It had been agreed by Jacob\u2019s relations that he would be lowered for his eternal rest very early that morning, so that normal church service may resume at the normal time, and the visitors from Lagos given enough time to return in view of the long journey ahead. Sadly, no one could have ever imagined the added tragedy that would add to the existing one just a few minutes later. Before his body was to be committed to earth, two of the policemen decided to pay him the traditional 21 Gun Salute. While, that of one of the policemen, ( whose name Saturday Vanguard could not get), fired his first shot into the air, causing a shudder among the crowd, the AK 47 of Sgt. Yusuf Momoh with Police Service number 166633, jammed. As the other officer intermittently fired into the air, Momoh was fidgeting with his gun, desperately trying to bring it back to life to join his colleague. And suddenly, it fired a volley of bullets, not into the air, but directly into the crowd of mourners. \u201cEveryone took to his heels and the confusion was unbelievable,\u201d recalled a Yarbung elder. \u201cAfter some time, we came back because some people had been shot and were writhing in pains on the grounds. Some youths wanted to pounce on the policeman, but we the elders intervened saying it was an unfortunate accident,\u201d he said. But, it was an accident that has setback and almost ruined the life of Haruna Solomon Gajere, 36, and a father of two girls. Gajere, who holds a Bsc. in Economics and a Masters Degree in Banking and Finance, all from Ahmadu Bello University, Zaria is a cousin of Corporal Jacob and was around for the internment of the man he said he had bonded very closely with. \u201cI was one of those shot that day,\u201d he told Saturday Vanguard on his wheel chair where he was being cared for by his unemployed wife, Nevan, at Bayan Dutse, Kaduna. \u201cThe policeman was reckless in his effort to get his gun working. And his rifle began shooting spontaneously, thereby hitting three of us \u2013 Emmanuel Angwa, Obadiah Chom and myself. \u201cFortunately for the other two victims who had bullets in the chest and leg they have all gotten their lives back and now on their feet performing their usual daily activities. But I am still here,\u201d he said. He went on: \u201cIt was unfortunate for me that I was hit in the neck where the bullet finally rested on my spine, causing paralysis from the chest downward. \u201cI also had four of my rib bones badly damaged. This has kept me in perpetual pains and agony till date. \u201cI was lucky it was in the morning and it was cold, so my blood pressure was not high, otherwise I may have bled to death. \u201cI was rushed to Ahmadu Bello University Teaching Hospital (ABUTH) Zaria about 300km away for medical attention. \u201cI spent six months on admission and had a spinal cord decompression. I was found to be suffering complete spinal cord injury. \u201cI was declared paralyzed from my chest downward. All through my stay in the hospital and despite different efforts to seek assistance from the police authority, my effort was declined by the management of Nigeria Police Force. \u201cI have tried all I could through Legal Aid Council of Nigeria, even the assistance of a lawyer and presently an appeal letter written by the Kaduna State Governor to seek a redress on how a complex spinal cord treatment can be done for me abroad, but all have failed due to the insensitive attitude of the police authority. \u201cThe Police Authority said that they did not order anyone to shoot me. That as far as they were concerned they have dismissed Sgt. Momoh from the police and that they cannot take responsibility for his action. They have therefore left me on my own. \u201cI have been in acute pain for about 4 years now because of lack of proper medical attention. My health diminishes by the day due to lack of proper medical intervention. \u201cOn my own I have tried to get my life back by not only getting out of the wheel chair on my own but recovering my ability to urinate and defecate without the use of catheter and manual extraction of waste through my rear. I have also started having sensations in areas they were lacking before. I strongly have faith in God that with the right assistance, I can resume normal physical activities. \u201cI went searching online where I can find an affordable hospital that can handle my case which then led me to Puhua International hospital, China. \u201cThe said hospital had requested for a recent MRI scan which I uploaded and sent to them for review, after examining my case they have assured me of gaining my ability to excrete, urinate, sensation recovery and limb movement which after extensive physiotherapy I could begin to attempt standing and walk. \u201cThis medical procedure will require about $50,000.00 in total. The cost of surgery alone is $36,000.00, cost of drugs, transportation for me and two helpers to China, feeding and other miscellaneous to be inclusive. \u201cI am appealing to, as a matter urgency, for help to save my depleting health and my suffering family. I am pleading with the Nigerian Police Force to take responsibility of my treatment in Puhua International Hospital, China for a Spinal Cord Stem cell transplant, and also to pay my medical bills and an estimated damages accrued over the period of forty five (45) months that I have been in this ugly condition.\u201d Saturday Vangaurd was able to reach Sgt. Yusuf Momoh on his phone number and the following ensured: Saturday Vanguard: \u201cIs that Sgt. Yusuf Momoh? Momoh: Yes, who is this please? Saturday Vanguard: I am calling you from Vanguard newspapers. Momoh: Ok, what is the problem sir? Saturday Vanguard: Are you still serving with the Nigeria Police? Momoh: No! I am back to my village. Saturday Vangaurd: Were you dismissed or you decided to resign? Momoh: I\u2019ve told you that I am in my village now and in fact I cannot hear you well. Saturday Vanguard: Do you recall the incident in which you were said to have shot some people in . . . (cuts) Momoh: Hello, I can\u2019t here you. . . Saturday Vanguard: I want to find out from you what happened . . .(cuts Momoh: Please, your network is bad. . . bye All means to re-establish connection failed after the dialogue Related",

        "title": "24- Hours @ LASUTH Accident & Emergency",
        "author": "Chioma Obinna",
        "text": "By Chioma Obinna Lagos State University Teaching Hospital, LASUTH, is a facility that records over 200 emergencies in two of its Accident & Emergency, A&E, units on a daily basis. Situated few kilometres away from the domestic terminal and Murtala Mohammed International Airport, Ikeja, LASUTH, is open to patients from all parts of the country and neighbouring African countries and is prone to unavoidable emergency cases at all times. The 600-bed tertiary hospital, adjudged to be the busiest in Lagos, has also obtained global relevance as a place where people with various illnesses including terminal ones seek help. Unfortunately, the non functional primary healthcare system across the country has not helped the facility to function effectively as a referral and research centre. From the gate of the hospital, it was obvious that the ongoing industrial action in some Federal Government hospitals in the state was actually taking its toll on the facility with a large crowd of patients in the premises. It was exactly 12:00 noon when our correspondent arrived at the Surgical and Emergency unit of the hospital, one of its A&E. Ambulances were strategically stationed in front of the emergency department. The running around of patients\u2019 relations, brisk walking of medical staff within the tidy compound that exude a hospitable ambience was not absent. Just opposite the LASEM was the ongoing construction of the Heliport as part of the new projects to improve services at the centre. The entrance into the two emergency departments, Medical Emergency and the Surgical Emergency departments were fully manned by neat security men. The triage nurse welcomes patients into the emergency and admission wards. The triage is where the process of determining the priority of patients\u2019 treatments takes place. A first time visitor to the A&E needs no soothsayer to tell that the section defines fate of patients in emergencies. There, you find relatives of patients either hallucinating, wandering around the entrance, praying or shedding tears. Some are found in groups discussing in low tones. Once a patient is done with the triage nurse and record officers and proper diagnoses done, treatment is initiated free of charge in the first 24- hours even when the patient is billed for referral to other hospitals. You could find some of these patients in an ambulance coach or wheel chairs because often times, the beds are full and most of the patients will require resuscitation before they are finally referred to other hospitals or moved to the wards. One striking thing that was observed during this visit was that unlike some other hospitals, health workers including the medical doctors in the department carry out their responsibilities with special care and passion. Saturday Vanguard witnessed an instance when a young boy diagnosed with hydrocephalus which resulted to blindness urinated on the bed as a female doctor started the process of cleaning up before a nurse arrived. Another instance Saturday Vanguard witnessed was the visit of two officials from NEMA who came to make arrangement for admission of three Nigerian deportees from Libya that will require immediate treatment from the airport. Although, there was no bed space at the time, they were encouraged to bring them straight from the airport at least for resuscitation. Our Correspondent also observed that some patients even after resuscitation are not eager to be referred to other hospitals without persuasion. Immediately a patient is brought in, a nurse and a doctor including the record officer attend to the patient. The next day after the patient must have been stabilised, the patient\u2019s overall health is assessed. Basic tests like blood pressure, pulse, body temperature, etc., are taken. Medications are strictly dispensed and adherence to treatment closely monitored by nurses. The first 24 hours are free of charge irrespective of the kind of care given to the patient. Patients who require urgent interventions are kept in the A&E for a maximum of 72 hours depending on the severity of their injuries. However, not all cases are admitted in the emergency wards. At the triage point, once it is discovered that a patient does not require emergency care, such patient is sent to the ward while those who come in with injuries have their bleeding controlled. Those who require oxygen are also given just as those with fractures are mobilised even if they will be referred. All these services are given free within 24 hours. However, contrary to reports that patients sleep on the floor, the four wards and 75 beds in both the Medical and Surgical Emergency were neatly kept and patients were seen lying on a well kept bed with neat bed spread. The five beds in the Intensive Care Unit, ICU, of the department were fully occupied with patients being monitored with functional modern monitors and six nurses strategically stationed in the room. But even as strict as the management of the hospital is regarding admitting patients once the beds are full, Saturday Vanguard gathered that relations of patients even begged to be admitted on a wheelchair hoping that a patient would eventually be moved to the ward any moment. Countless cases of patients \u2018relations becoming violent have been recorded at the unit. Just last week, a father of a sick baby was arrested after he resorted to violence and damaged the hospital properties. However, a patient who has been in the department for four days and have regained consciousness confirmed to Saturday Vanguard that: \u201cThere is no need going outside the country to spend so much money when a centre like this is here.\u201d The patient, who gave his name as Mr. Uche Daniels, said: \u201cI have been here for about four days now. The doctors and nurses are very kind here. I am being given drugs three times a day. Unlike what we hear about government hospitals, the doctors usually come from time to time to check on us here. They are trying but we want them to do more. Emergency services One of the medical doctors in the Surgical Emergency unit, Dr. Olufunmi Babalola hinted Saturday Vanguard that not less than 60 to 70 emergency cases are attended to in the centre on a daily basis. \u201cThis place is like a transient area. Most patients here are usually unconscious. We have monitors and machines that record their vitals. Everyone in the ICU is on oxygen and nurses are on standby to monitor them. We also have couches in the ICU and whoever requires suturing we have a room like a mini-theatre. We don\u2019t treat patients on the floor. Once the beds are full they are full. Although, when there is no bed we stabilize all our patients, we resuscitate with fluids, pain killers, antibiotics and even if a patient requires oxygen we give but once a patient is stabilised we refer to another centre. \u201cOne thing about this centre is that we have enough doctors, nurses and the bed space here in the surgical ward are over 30 beds including couches. About 12 to 15 doctors work in here. \u201cWe have about 40 nurses and they run shift. Rules are observed in this place. Food vendors are not allowed here. We have eateries and the hospital\u2019s kitchen also serves foods for the patients.\u201d At the Medical Emergency department of LASUTH, there were patients from all over the country including some from neighbouring countries like Ghana and Republic of Benin. In this unit, female and male patients are kept in separate wards. There are two resuscitation rooms with two beds, 11 beds for female wards and 12 beds for males. There also a number of couches to support the beds before patients are moved to the wards. There is also a separate room for tetanus patients. These special patients are not managed with others for medical reasons. Also, about 70 patients are seen in this unit on a daily basis out of which about 60 will be admitted. The admission starts from the triage point, where a senior nurse identifies the nature of the illness and the record officer will be there to take information from the relatives while a doctor goes back to complete documentation and hand over to the team on call on that day. Patients who are not critically ill are taken in, all vital signs taken and they are moved to the consulting rooms where doctors are waiting to attend to them. Each morning, a nurse goes round the wards to find out how many bed spaces are available and record it on the notice board. At this point, patients brought over night who are stable will be moved out. The Head of Department, LASUTH Medical Emergency, Dr. Adekunle Taiwo says patients sometimes are referred to other hospitals because there is no way they can admit between 50 and 60 patient on a daily basis. \u201cIn as much as we would have loved to do so, we can\u2019t, due to lack of beds. We refer to other hospitals. But we must resuscitate before we refer to other government hospitals. \u201cThis place is usually crowded because people have refused to patronise primary Healthcare Centres and once they are here it is difficult to send them back. Many people do not know that they can access help in those health centres. We need media assistants in the area of creating awareness that PHCs also function like a hospital. This place is supposed to be a referral centre, where patients are referred from secondary care level or from another Teaching hospitals. Related",

In arriving at the theme of the International Conference On the Asaba Genocide of October 7 1967, the University of South Florida, discreetly avoided to delve into the motivations that led to the frenzy which decimated a particular city and whole generation of her men. Asaba a Nigerian historic town, had taken a direct hit and suffered the brunt of the civil war. All the same, Prof. Elizerbeth Bird in her introduction and summary report proclaimed that the goal of the Asaba project among others, \u201cis to carry out ethnographic, historical research with the final aim to create an authoritative account of the 1967 Massacre, and assist the community of Asaba to develop plans for a permanent memorial. \u201cUltimately,'' stated the Professor and Head of the History and Archeology Department of USC, \u201cthe aim is to bring together those on both sides of the killings, to unite them in reconcilliation and closure. Eventually, she continued, \u201cthe people of Asaba will win a more comprehensive apology for the survivors and their relations, following the September 2001 apology offerred by the former Head of State, General Yakubu Gowon. Emphasising that Asaba and her people, had always remained Nigerian citizens, even during the war, the Professor warned that never again, will such citizens be subjected to such trauma stressing that, such tragic events should never be forgotten. Meanwhile, Asaba is moving out all her big cannons and in an unprecedented efforts at unifying its leaders to support the organizers and the University of South Florida this time, according to Mr. Uche Oduah, President of the US Asaba Community in Dallas, \u201cto reclaim our forgotten history.\u201d He revealed that meetings of her prominent sons and daughters have continued in Abuja, Lagos and Asaba. From the Palace, Nigeria's foremost philosopher and the Chairman of the influential Lagos Metropolitan Club, Chief Philip Asiodu, the Izoma of Asaba, will present the\u00c2 keynote address at the Florida October 7 International Conference. Invitations have been extended to His Lordship, Emmanuel Osadebay, the Chief Justice of the Caribbean Island of Bahamas. Emmanuel is the first son of the late grandmaster on the Niger, Chief Dennis Osadebay, the first and the last Premier of the Midwest State, who was the only Nigerian that acted as the President and Commander-in-Chief of the country when the then President Azikiwe was on leave.

In extending another invitation to the President of the Black Gold group, Kaduna, the organizers hope that Chief Sonny Okogwu and her prominent sisters, would take some leave off the Ship House and after forty years dedicate one day to pay some over due respects to his late peerless father and all his fallen iconic wasted peer generation.

This is the first board that instituted it, and the essence of the Service Delivery Committee is to look into the welfare of staff, issues of the workability and functionality of the equipment and various organs of this establishment both within and outside. \u201cSince we came and have the singular honour of chairing this committee, we have gone round, visited every units, giving out data forms for all of you to fill your complaints. Those who felt cheated in placements, promotions and advancements\u2026 Many of you have the capacity\u2026 \u201cWhen you are happy, you put in your best. This is a medical institution and it is the duty of each and every one of you to deliver the standard that is synonymous with the best practices all over the world. I must say that despite the constraints here; in terms of infrastructure or otherwise, I think I can rate this hospital as one of the best in this country. \u201cSome consultants do not have room enough to describe as their offices. In all the departments many people do not have enough space because this compound is the old Nnewi General Hospital if I am correct, which had been converted to a teaching hospital. \u201cThe good thing is that if you go to the permanent site you will see the enormous work being done and I pray that very soon most of you will be transferred to the new site where you will have enough space to work. I have to plead and admonish all of you that the country is going through tight financial difficulty\u2026,\u2019\u2019 he said. Related",

        "author": "Abdulwahab Abdulah",
        "text": "By Abdulwahab Abdulah An Ikeja High Court yesterday sentenced 27-year-old Oluwaseun Oladapo, to death by hanging for murdering a Lagos based human rights lawyer, Mr Kunle Fadipe and his mother-in-law, Mrs Cecilia Owolabi. In her judgement, justice Oluwatoyin Ipaye found Oladapo guilty on a five-count charge of murder, armed robbery and assault occasioning harm pressed against him by the state. Handing down her sentence, Justice said: \u201cOn count one, you Oluwaseun Oladapo, is to be hung by the neck till you are dead. \u201cOn count three, you Oluwaseun Oladapo, is to be hung by the neck till you are dead. \u201cOn count four, you Oluwaseun Oladapo is sentenced to three years in prison. \u201cOn count five, you Oluwaseun Oladapo is sentenced to three years in prison. \u201cThe terms of imprisonment of counts three, four and five is that they should run concurrently. This is the judgment of the court.\u201d Earlier before the sentence was passed, counsel to the convict, Mr Worer Obuagbaka pleaded for mercy on behalf of the convict. \u201cI ask this honourable court to give him a second chance, he is a young man who is still useful to society, I urge this honourable court to please temper justice with mercy,\u201d Obuagbaka said. Responding, prosecuting counsel, Mrs O.A Olugasa said: \u201cThe deceased was not given a second chance, his children were not given a second chance to have their father with them. \u201cI urge the court to give the harshest punishment to the convict so that justice can be seen to be done.\u201d Oladapo, allegedly murdered the lawyer at 3am on July 4, 2014 at his residence located at No. 1 Harmony Estate, Ifako-Ijaiye, Iju, Lagos. The prosecution was led by Mr Adeniji Kazeem, the Lagos State Attorney General and Commissioner for Justice and Mrs Idowu Alakija, the Director of Public Prosecution (DPP). Oladapo, was also charged with the murder of Mrs Cecelia Owolabi, the mother-in-law to the late Fadipe, but the charge of murder was commuted to assault occasioning harm by the court. Explaining the reason for why the murder charge of Owolabi was rejected, Justice Ipaye said: \u201cThe prosecution did not prove a direct link between the actions of the defendant and the death of Madam Cecelia Owolabi. \u201cHe is however, found guilty of the assault occasioning harm of Madam Cecelia Owolabi.\u201d During the trial, the wife of the late lawyer, Mrs Kemi Fadipe, in her testimony gave a graphic details of how the lawyer was murdered. Kemi, a school proprietress said: \u201cMy husband came in late from the office at 10pm and he was preparing for a flight to Abuja the following day, we both had retired to our bedroom. \u201cOur home is a five \u2013 bedroom duplex and there was no electricity that night, the home was well lit because the generator was on. \u201cAt 11.45pm, power was restored and my son Folahanmi went to put off the generator, a few minutes after he left, he came running upstairs screaming for help. \u201cHe had a stab wound on his head and was being pursued by the defendant who was armed with a knife. \u201cThe commotion alerted my husband and I rushed to the anti-room upstairs where we saw the defendant and Folahanmi. \u201cThe defendant was saying that someone had to die today and demanded N500,000, threatening us that members of his gang had surrounded the house. \u201cWe knelt down to plead with him and my husband instructed me to get a white envelope containing cash from the jacket of his suit. \u201cWhen the envelope was handed over to the defendant, he was dissatisfied and demanded for laptops and phones and we told him those items were downstairs. \u201cHe for no reason, lunged at Folahanmi with a knife and my husband stepped in to save him and he was stabbed in his neck and his chest.\u201d Kemi said after her husband was stabbed, Oladapo ran downstairs where he unfortunately encountered her mother. \u201cMy mother came out from her bedroom downstairs to investigate the source of the commotion and the defendant ran into her, stabbing her in the chest.\u201d \u201cI, the maid and my sister struggled with him in the living room downstairs, he was hit on the head with a stabiliser but he was behaving in a wild and crazed manner and very strong and hard to subdue. court \u201cMy husband and Folahanmi ran out to get help but my husband collapsed in the premises. \u201c Folahanmi got help from the security guard of the estate who subdued the defendant by shooting him with a gun.\u201d She said that Fadipe was rushed to a hospital where he gave up the ghost at 4am, her mother who came to Lagos from Ibadan for an eye operation was discharged from the hospital but died in Ibadan from the shock and trauma of the incident two weeks later. \u201cMy son Folahanmi, a student of one of the tertiary institutions in the country, lost a year of school due to the trauma of the head and chest injuries he sustained during the attack,\u201d Kemi said. Miss Biola Owolabi, the sister-in-law to the late lawyer in her testimony during the trial attested to the strength of Oladapo. \u201cHe scaled the fence of the house and lay in wait at the generator house where he threatened and attacked Folahanmi whom had come to put off the generator. \u201cIt was difficult to subdue him after during the frenzied attack, he was like a man possessed, he had the strength of 10 men, everyone sustained injuries\u201d she said. A pathologist, Dr Sunday Soyemi in his testimony, revealed the cause of Fadipe\u2019s death. \u201cThe cause of death was rapid and severe blood loss caused by the severe nice of the left jugular vein,\u201d Soyemi said. Mr Bamidele Sanni, a security guard at the Harmony Estate had testified during the trial that he shot Oladapo on the leg to incapacitate him. \u201cWhen I got to the Fadipe home, the defendant was still difficult to subdue, I shot him in the leg to incapacitate him and I put a call to the police at the Iju Police Station. However, Oladapo, while testifying in yoruba in his defence, denied committing the offence. According to him, on the night of the murder, he left a viewing centre to go to his home and he had to take a shortcut via Harmony Estate. \u201cWhen I got to the Harmony Estate, an altercation occurred between me the security guard and four men, they beat me up, subdued me and shot at my leg. \u201cI fainted and woke up the hospital, I fainted again and woke up four days later at the police station,\u201d he said.

        "author": "Paul Bassey",
        "text": "By Paul Bassey Many thanks to all sports columnists and writers who have in the past one week done a thorough analysis of the outgoing year. What else can I say? 2012 was a year ruled by an unparalleled Olympics disaster, one that beclouded all the accolades garnered by the Nigeria Football Federation as regards National Teams. Never in the history of our football did ALL the national teams qualify for the finals of all the continental competitions they entered for. Even as I ask President Maigari and his board and management to take a bow, I can say little about the development of the game, and the domestic league in Nigeria. Two weeks ago I had a chance meeting with the Sports Minister in his office at the National Stadium Abuja. I started by briefing him on the Mobil Secondary schools Athletics Championship in Akwa Ibom State. Originally billed to attend, a last minute assignment saw him sending his Director Grass Roots Sports Development Alhassan Yakmut to represent him and wanted an update. (Congrats Yakmut on your merited appointment and promotion). Then we talked about his challenges in the National Sports Commission, why he opened up the National Sports Festival, his desire to make the U-17 festival a reality and his wish that our domestic league can be like the English Premiership! I tasked him on the Sponsorship of the league and sympathised with his political disposition that may not afford him the opportunity to actualize his dreams in office. File photo: Okagbare shortly after a race Because it was a chance meeting, we parted to meet again, in the new year. From the Minister\u2019s office I headed for the fabled Glass House of the Nigeria Football Association where the Technical Committee had been invited to discuss Stephen Keshi\u2019s Nations Cup list. The Big Boss came prepared with all his four assistants. What he was not prepared for, was the spontaneous query regarding the omission of Martins, Taiwo and Osaze from the list. Members of the Technical Committee were unanimous that Nigeria needed to go to South Africa with the best legs there are, and presently Osaze was one of the best. By the time Keshi and his assistants finished explaining the reasons for his omission, there was nothing to fault him. Post events have certainly proven the coach right. Much as I do not want to drag us back, the coaches were skeptical about a player who withdrew from National duty just because he was substituted during a match at the last world cup. \u201c\u2026Sirs, as I am talking to you I have an idea of my starting eleven and Osaze may not be there as he has not been part of our plans so far. What happens if I go to South Africa and I do not give Osaze a starting shirt, don\u2019t you think it will cause more problems for the team?\u2026.\u201d Keshi explained. Then, there was the issue of lack of respect for constituted authority. A player who decides not to respect his captain is definitely not a team player and a destablising factor. Coach Keshi also reminded us that when he invited Osaze in November to take part in the Venezuela friendly, he said he could not because his wife was expecting a baby. As you are reading this, Osaze\u2019s wife is yet to put to bed! Let me move to a more fundamental issue, that of Sola Ameobi and Danny Shittu. I got a mail recently accusing me and the Technical committee of ignorance. \u201c\u2026.Why did you sanction the invitation of Ameobi and Shittu when you knew they will not be available?\u201d No, we did not know they will not be available. Besides they are required by law TO BE AVAILABLE or face the consequences. Ameobi is said to have signed a contract excluding him from the Nations Cup. If he did that, why did he make himself available against Venezuela? At that point he would have told the coach that he had sold his birth right to the greedy and selfish European slave mongers and dictators called managers. This story is not strange. It is the club versus country imbroglio, it is the blackmail in Europe especially in the Premiership where Managers arm twist African players, threaten and force them to deny their countries before they are signed on. Can you imagine Steve Piennar Captain of South Africa opting out of a Nations cup that will be held in his own country? Tears\u2026.tears\u2026.for our enslaved youth. As earlier said, we have the capacity to ensure that if they do not turn up for country, they do not also play for their clubs during the period. But what can you do about a player who \u201cvoluntarily\u201d signed off his availability? What? The Super Eagles have always been a tournament team. I believe as the competition progresses, the team will gather steam, destination Semi Final\u2026\u2026\u2026. AKS Governor\u2019s Cup On Saturday I was at Uyo as Match Commissioner for the Akwa Ibom State Governor\u2019s Cup final between Uyo and Eket, an exciting match that needed penalties at the end of regulation time for Uyo to win 5-4. I congratulate Chairman Effiong Johnson and his board for putting forward a credible show. I was particularly impressed by the 6 Million naira prize money (With the winners going home with 3 million naira cash). Chief Effiong Johnson is a board member of the Nigeria Football Federation in a country where clubs do not get anything for winning the domestic league. He says there will be a change in 2013. He says the NFF, after a credible 2012 will emerge stronger in 2013. That was also the prayer of the sports minister, that starting with The Eagles in South Africa and given all his plans and aspirations especially in the development of sports, there will be a lot to celebrate in the coming year in all the sports as a committee has been set up to review the membership of all the sports associations with a view to identifying those who have knowledge and passion for the sports they will be appointed to serve. Adamu thanks God for life Today, there will be a roll call of Nigeria\u2019s who\u2019s who in sports as Dr Amos Adamu the larger than life ex Director, Sports Development of the National Sports Commission celebrates sixty years on mother earth. Close associates and family members will join him in a prayer session at home this morning before the party billed for the Events Centre in Ikeja by 1pm. Happy Birthday Doc. To all our readers, friends and well wishers, thanks for making me part of your sports fixture in 2012, wishing you a 2013 full of cheer, health, wealth and God\u2019s favour. See you next year.

        "author": "Paul Bassey",
        "text": "By Paul Bassey The headline carried by Complete Sports newspaper yesterday was very appealing. Cash rain for Malawi to beat Eagles. The story said the Malawi Flames welfare package will be improved by \u201chundred percent \u201c before their all important 2014 World Cup qualifier against Nigeria in September. The story quoted Suzgo Nyirenda the General Secretary of the Football Association of Malawi ( FAM ) as saying further that a proposal has been sent to the National Sports Council to up the winning bonus from K 30,000 to K100,000 while the daily camp allowance will be moved from $50 dollars a day to $75 dollars a day. Tahiti\u2019s goalkeeper Xavier Samin dives for the ball as Nigeria\u2019s forward Anthony Ujah heads to the goal, during their FIFA Confederations Cup Brazil 2013 Group B football match, at the Mineirao Stadium in Belo Horizonte on June 17, 2013. Photo: AFP. From investigation, Malawi Kwasha 330, equals one dollar, so by simple arithmetic, efforts are on to pay the Malawians $300 dollars (Yes three hundred dollars) as winning bonus for them to beat the Super Eagles! Don\u2019t laugh. I wonder whether the Eagles are reading this. Let us move from there to Zambia, host of the ongoing Council of South African Football Associations (COSAFA) Senior Challenge competition. As you are reading this, I am not sure Coach Keshi has left for Zambia, but that is where he should be. COSAFA embraces Zambia, South Africa, Angola, Malawi, Namibia, Lesotho etc. In Zambia, Coach Keshi with or any of his assistants will not only have the opportunity of watching Malawi at close quarters but will also benefit a sneak preview of South Africa and Zambia, two countries we are likely to face in the decisive round of the World Cup if they make it out of their groups. Before we get back to Football, let us punctuate the stories with that of a young man called Divine Ejowokoghene Oduduru. \u201c Africa\u2019s fastest youth\u201d I repeat that one of the best things to happen to our sports was the African Junior Athletics Championship hosted by AFN in Delta State and won by Nigeria, dusting all the Kenyans, Ethiopians and South Africans of the of world track and field. I gave the Federation Kudos for it and prayed others to emulate same. After that championship, I got to read a lot of rave reviews about the champions of that event. A particular coach could have taken a full page advert in a newspaper to gloat over his discovery of Oduduru, who he swore was Usain Bolt personified. Off we went to the IAAF World Youth Championship in Donetsk and stories filtered out that did no credit to my great expectations of a medals haul. What of the \u201cgreat\u201d Oduduru ? That he failed to even qualify for the 100m final but was ready to make amends in the 200m by blowing the opposition to smithereens. Sunday afternoon, I had the privilege of watching Oduduru in the 200m final. What a disappointment, coming in 6th with a time of 21.37 seconds in the race won by Jamaica\u2019s Michael Ohara in 20.63 seconds. In the words of my wife, \u201c Why is he so thick and stiff?\u201d Was Warri a fluke? How come other Africa countries we dusted were winning medals with ease? (Including Nigerian born Ketira Orji of the US who leapt 6.39 in the Long Jump girls). In the Boys medley relay final we blundered to 7th position. Felt so bad on Sunday listening to the Kenyan and Ethiopian anthems again and again, watching their athletes mounting the victory rostrum so often (In the 3000m steeplechase girls, it was all African affair) Kenya placed second on the overall medals tables with eleven medals including four gold. Ethiopia had eight medals, South Africa two, while Egypt and Morocco also appeared on the medals table. No Nigeria. Pray, do we need a probe to find out what happened in Warri and Donetsk? Talking about probes, after reading Adokiye, Odegbami, Christian Okpara, Pius Ayinor\u2026\u2026..I have nothing to add concerning the scandalous 145-0 scoreline that has made us the laughing stock of world football. I have also called on the NFF to probe the strange ouster of Rangers from the CAF Confederation Cup. Tomorrow, a panel will sit to probe allegations of sell out in the National League, while a panel set up by the NSC to look at the Bonus issue and the Super Eagles embarrassing posture in Namibia is to conclude its sitting by next week. The NFF reacted swiftly by stepping into the scandalous Nationwide row, but Christian Okpara of the Guardian says \u201c \u2026..But followers of Nigerian football believe the NFF action could be the prelude to sweeping the matter under the carpet. Their argument is hinged on the Federation\u2019s treatment of previous cases of match fixing including the Lobi Stars versus Sunshine Stars case of last season \u201c Weighty, very weighty. The NFF must therefore act with dispatch. The current case is without mincing words a national disgrace and we must get to the bottom of it and fast too. NFF is the sole football controlling body in the land. They are to conduct the preliminary investigation and decide to transfer same to either the police or the EFCC as the case may be. Any thing to the contrary will be viewed differently. Ask FIFA. See you next week Related",

        "text": "By Les Leba Nigerians were recently agitated by the British government\u2019s proposed demand for a \u00a33000 bond as prerequisite for the issuance of a six-month visa for visitors from Nigeria, and five other Commonwealth countries to the United Kingdom. The British High Commissioner, on his side, noted that the financial bond was a way of tackling abuse of the UK immigration system. In an attempt to assuage the concerns expressed, the UK mission advised that, the bond would only affect a small number of the highest risk Nigerian visa applicants, and those who do not violate the original terms of entry would receive a refund on return to Nigeria. However, critics observe that the conservative party in the UK hopes to reap political, security and financial benefits from the \u2018visa bond\u2019 policy, when effected. In recent years, the results of elections in several European countries have been critically influenced by a swelling demand by electorates for tougher immigration policies, as indigenous European populations become seriously concerned about what they consider as the threat of liberal immigration policies to their culture and social welfare. It is also expected that the requirement for a visa bond would enhance security by selectively reducing entry to potential fundamentalists and terrorist materials. Thirdly, critics also, see a \u2018parasitic\u2019 financial benefit in the proposed policy. For example, the British High Commission confirmed that over 180,000 Nigerians apply to visit the UK annually; in reality, with current visa fees of about N20,000, this would translate to over N3.6bn annually; i.e. a sizeable revenue source that may, in fact, be adequate to run the UK mission in Nigeria. Indeed, if each visa applicant pays the new bond price of \u00a33000, the British treasury will forcibly collect over \u00a3540m from Nigerians. Furthermore, if only 10 per cent of applicants pay the \u00a33000 bond, this would still mean an interest-free loan of about \u00a354m from economically beleaguered Nigerians, just for the joy of visiting a Commonwealth nation, which arguably became sumptuously endowed from the sweat of the people and wealth of its former colonies. Curiously, francophone countries, from whom the British derived minimal capital, and indeed, other politically more volatile Arab states have been exempted from the visa levy. Incidentally, there is no indication that the bond refunds would earn any interest for the six months \u2018loan\u2019 to the UK government by Visa applicants. It is also not yet clear what currency the Embassy will demand as settlement for the \u00a33000 visa bond! Currently, several foreign missions are very clear about the quality of naira denominations that are acceptable for settling their receipted fees. Expectedly, both the Nigerian and Indian governments have cautioned the UK about the implications of retaliatory measures; Ambassador Gbenga Ashiru stressed that Nigeria might also impose the \u00a33000 visa bond on British visitors. However, the Nigerian threat may not bring much comfort to long-suffering Nigerians, who have witnessed dramatic government somersaults on such issues in the past. for example, since the Aviation Ministry threatened fire and brimstone over the oppressive airfares charged by British Airways between Nigeria and Britain, regrettably, nothing more has happened, and the initial yell of protest has become less than a whimper; meanwhile, Nigerians continue to pay what some describe as selective extortionist rates to British Airways. The threat is that if the Uk succeeds in its bid, other countries may also demand visa bonds from Nigerians. Instructively, however, even if Nigeria also makes good its threat to reciprocate the \u00a33000 bond, visa applications from British citizens, the revenue inflow will still be a far cry from the payment by over 180,000 Nigerian applicants for UK visa. Readers will recall that Nigerians have not always been unpopular visitors to the UK; for example, before 1985, I embarked on at least two visits to the UK without a visa issued in Lagos; the visas were ultimately issued without any fuss or harrowing demands at the point of entry at Heathrow airport, Curiously, on one occasion, the immigration officers were alarmed that I wished to spend only a week in the UK, and therefore encouraged me to spend longer time and enjoy their beautiful country. Surprisingly, in spite of my reluctance to extend my visit, I was still given a six-month visa. Curiously, even when Nigeria was a pariah nation as a result of military rule, Nigerian visitors were still gladly welcomed because the big spending appetite of our people was sweet music on British High streets. (Incredibly, our foreign reserves were below $5bn then, but the naira exchanged almost at par with the British Pound Sterling, and wage levels and job opportunities in Nigeria were relatively better than elsewhere!). Not surprisingly, the commercial bond of friendship gradually began to wane as the naira exchange rate literally crashed on the adoption of the IMF-sponsored Structural Adjustment Programme, and several industries closed shop as raw material costs escalated; evidently, the popularity of the Nigerian tourist has over time become negatively adjusted in consonance with our \u2018sick\u2019 naira. The collapse of the Nigerian economy and abiding double-digit inflation rates over many years have led to reduction in job opportunities and ultimately also opened the floodgates for Nigerian job seekers, some of whom embark on suicidal journeys across deserts and oceans to the UK and elsewhere. Paradoxically, we are encouraged to celebrate the cash inflow that comes as personal remittance from the employment of Nigerians in the diaspora; whether or not this cash inflow compensates for the attendant antisocial impact of brain and manpower drain on the economy is another question entirely. Painfully, also, according to a report credited to Governor Olusegun Mimiko, Nigerians still spend over N80bn ($500m) annually, to train our young ones in UK educational institutions. Worse still, the beneficiaries of this sacrifice will remain reluctant to come back to Nigeria after the completion of their studies, because of the scarcity of jobs as well as the foreign exchange valuation of the existing wage structure.

        "author": "Ochereome Nnanna",
        "text": "By Ochereome Nnanna PRESIDENT Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s plan to borrow $30 billion foreign loan has been unveiled, and will soon be tabled before the National Assembly for approval. If his intention sails through, it will be the single largest loan tranche in the history of Nigeria. Politically, it will mean that barely eleven years after the President Olusegun Obasanjo-led People\u2019s Democratic Party,PDP, Federal Government leveraged on the connections of its Finance Minister, Dr. Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, to negotiate a 12 billion buyback deal to exit Nigeria from the Paris Club $30 billion debt burden, the President Muhammadu Buhari-led All Progressives Congress, APC, Federal Government will be taking Nigeria back to that \u201cEgypt\u201d. PDP, which is now the main opposition party, has (understandably) risen in vehement opposition to this borrowing plan which it sees as a reversal of one of its milestone achievements during its sixteen years in power which the APC Federal Government likes to describe maliciously as a period of \u201crot\u201d. By the time this new debt is added to our existing internal and external debts we may be in the hole for about $60 billion. This is why the PDP shout of \u201cwolf!\u201d, \u201cwolf!!\u201d at this gargantuan borrowing plan is not the mere \u201cwailings\u201d of a disgruntled opposition party. But PDP should go beyond the usual opposition reflex of kicking against this risk-laden venture (though the APC would have done the same if it was still in the opposition). It should proffer a better plan towards getting Nigeria out of the suffering that this crushing recession has imposed on the government and the people. That is what credible and intelligent opposition is all about. If you are saying \u201cno\u201d to a policy, show us a superior alternative. The APC Federal Government has made it clear that it intends to borrow and spend Nigeria out of the recession. On its surface, that is not a bad idea. It is either we continue to pray and hope that oil prices will bounce back or we do something dramatic to launch out of the hole \u2013 and pay the price later. I support this borrowing idea, subject to terms and conditions which I will discuss shortly. I do not think we can successfully diversify the economy based on the pittance we are receiving from oil sales, taxes and Customs revenues alone. Diversification requires massive investments in power, infrastructure, agriculture, housing and other revenue-yielding sectors from which we can repay our loans. Therefore, my number one condition for supporting the loan is that it must be strictly devoted to sectors that will boost economic activities, productivity and prosperity. Beyond ensuring that the loan is bankably invested, the projects must also be EQUITABLY DISTRIBUTED. In other words, it must be deployed in such a way that every section of the country will benefit without some sections feeling cheated. The principle of the Federal Character and even distribution of the commonwealth of Nigeria, which Buhari has so far jettisoned in favour of \u201cthose who voted for him\u201d (the so-called \u201c97%/5%\u201d) must not be allowed here. The reason for this is simple and germane. We are all going to bear the burden equally. It is going to affect the present and future generations of Nigeria equally without minding which section of the country they come from. We are all going to pay the price equally. Therefore, we must all enjoy the benefits equally. I am harping on this because of the naked nepotism that this administration has demonstrated without caring about the outcries it has generated since its seventeen months in power. Buhari has shown he has his own sense of what is due to the various sections of Nigeria which has no bearing whatever with the Federal Character formula espoused in our Constitution. If we leave it to him alone, he will repeat the inequitable distribution pattern he employed when he was the Executive Chairman of the defunct Petroleum Trust Fund, PTF, whereby most of the intervention projects were sited in the deep North. Already, the outlines of his pattern of spending the proposed loan show he is going to exclude the South East almost completely if newspaper reports are anything to go by. For instance, none of the nearly eight billion Dollar railway projects listed for execution with the loan will run through an inch of the South East. There is a Lagos-Ibadan double track ($1.3b) and a Kano-Kaduna segment ($1.1b) which together form the Lagos \u2013 Kano Western line. Nothing is said about the Port Harcourt \u2013 Enugu \u2013 Makurdi \u2013 Jos \u2013 Maiduguri \u2013 Nguru line which forms the Eastern flank of the Nigerian rail system. Instead, we see what they call the Calabar \u2013 Port Harcourt \u2013 Onne Deep Seaport \u201ccoastal\u201d rail line ($3.5b) and another Abuja Mass Rail Transit ($1.6b), which will be added to the one already built by the Goodluck Jonathan regime in the FCT.. A proper rail network that will cover the whole country equitably and make every Nigerian happy to bear the $30 billion debt burden should run as follows: (a) Port Harcourt \u2013 Enugu \u2013 Jos \u2013 Nguru in the East; (b) Lagos \u2013 Ibadan \u2013 Minna \u2013 Kaduna \u2013 Kano with branch-offs to Sokoto and Zamfara; (c) and the Lagos \u2013 Ore \u2013 Benin \u2013 Asaba/Onitsha \u2013 Aba \u2013 Uyo \u2013 Calabar South Central line. This line should branch off at Agbor to connect with the existing Warri \u2013 Ajaokuta abandoned standard gauge, which should be extended to Abuja and link up with the recently commissioned standard gauge to Kaduna. That way, all the geopolitical zones of the country will be linked by rail, thus enhancing national unity. It will not be restricted only to the North and West where Buhari won election and the South-South, which the APC Federal Government wants to capture by all means. If Buhari\u2019s unconfirmed railway network is implemented, the South East will be left in the cold. This factor of marginalisation in the distribution of federal projects was chiefly responsible for the South Easterners having no choice but to migrate to other parts of the country in search of opportunities. The rails must not only be evenly distributed, they must also run through cities with large enough populations to enable us pay back the debt in record time. Putting the rails through uninhabited \u201ccoastal\u201d areas shows this administration is not serious about implementing that aspect of the project. It will merely be used to woo the support of the people of those swampy terrains and later abandoned due to the unsustainably huge costs and the un-bankability factor. Modernise their waterways instead. When this loan proposal reaches the National Assembly, our lawmakers must take bold steps to correct the flaws of sectional favouritism and marginalisation inherent in the Buhari vision of developing Nigeria. They must ensure that every section is taken along. It is our collective burden, and therefore, it must be for our collective benefit. Otherwise, forget it. Our British colonial masters designed our existing railway network 115 years ago to unite the North with the South and allow the landlocked North to benefit from the sea gateways of the South. It helped to boost commerce and bring peoples from across the country together to share common values. Our rail system of the 21st century and beyond must follow the same pattern and even improve on it, rather than being used continue the post-civil war policy of excluding the Igbo people from the commonwealth of Nigeria because of their constitutionally-guaranteed political choices. It is incumbent on federal legislators from the South East and all patriotic federal parliamentarians to ensure that the benefits of the borrowing are evenly distributed. It is either we do this or we dump the deal. The loan will be our collective burden. It must be for our collective benefit. Related",

        "author": "Helen Ovbiagele",
        "text": "By Helen Ovbiagele The word \u2018dunce\u2019 was freely used by teachers during my primary school days, when you showed ignorance in any subject, even in what the teacher hasn\u2019t taught you, but which is in your text books, or has appeared in the newspapers .. At College, it gained some sophistication and \u2018dunce\u2019 became \u2018blockhead\u2019. Whichever the case, if you had an atom of self-respect, you made sure that you avoided what would earn you that name, otherwise, it could become your middle name. So, you had to be one step ahead of the game, and you read as widely as you could (text books, newspapers, etc) and memorized and crammed details about important people, places and evel1ts, both local and international, into your head. Apart from being booed by the class for failing to provide the right answers, you could get caned in front of the class too, if your non-performance is a habit. There were no calculators, or, internet search engines, etc. to help get answers, yet, as much as possible, you had the answers at the tips of your fingers, just in case you got asked. While there\u2019s been a huge relief that corporal punishment and forced learning have been much watered down or even eliminated in our educational system, knowledge of any sort has taken a deep dive. Modern day parents, teachers and their wards, seem perfectly happy to be ignorant about everything; except, of course, things that have to do with making money, sports, reality shows, or having a nice time out there. Many citizens are oblivious of history-making events. This doesn\u2019t seem to ring true, when more things are happening in all areas of life now than ever before, and the world has become a global village through communication \u2013 the GSM, internet, radio, television, satellite cable television, and we have more audience participation. Yes, but our knowledge lacks depth, especially if you\u2019re one of those who like a deep understanding of events. Maybe it\u2019s because some of us are from the era when History and Geography were taken seriously as an important part of our life, and taught separately as subjects in class. Drawing the map of Nigeria, West Africa, Africa and the world was a regular assignment, and you knew the names of world capitals and heads of state, by the time you completed your secondary school education. These days, I doubt if all students of higher institutions in the country know all our state capitals and the governors, and the history of our country. When a friend\u2019s undergraduate son strolled into their sitting room as we were discussing a national newspaper\u2019s lead headline, \u2018Why we lost Bakassi to Cameroun, by Duke\u2019, and we were wondering whether the matter could surface in future, his father asked him how much he knew about it. \u201cAh, dad, one can\u2019t know all these things, now. It\u2019s not part of our learning world. We concentrate on our syllabus \u2013 what we need to pass the relevant examinations. Times have changed, sir. Only those doing Journalism should bother with world events. I\u2019ve heard Bakassi mentioned, but I wasn\u2019t curious. Why should I be, dad?\u201d he asked. \u201cYou see the ignorance of our future leaders?\u201d scoffed the dad. \u201cHe\u2019s heard of the name, but didn\u2019t feel it was necessary to know about it, even if it\u2019s googling it on the internet. Young people\u2019s lack of curiosity in important matters, never ceases to amaze me. \u201c \u201cDad, I\u2019m studying Accounting. This name Bakassi is not important to it, is it?\u201d \u201cBut it used to be part of our home state. It\u2019s not that far from Calabar.\u201d \u201cUsed to be part of Cross River State? What happened to it, dad? Okay, okay! Can I use your Blackberry to google it?\u201d \u201cYou may google it, but the account in this paper by an ex-governor on why we lost it to Cameroun, may also help, since it involves efforts made by Nigeria to keep it. Here. Whatever the course you\u2019re taking at the university, you should know the history of our people. You may find yourself a leader some day, who knows? How would you rule well, if you have no grip of history and geography of the people? Anyway, it isn\u2019t entirely your fault. It\u2019s the educational system. If such an important event took place in our days, our teachers would have made it the topic of the day and discussed it at length in class. Getting people transferred from one country to another one, is not an every day occurrence.\u201d This is true. Future generations are going to wonder how it happened and why we allowed it, and the efforts we made to retain it. On the internet, I had read that on \u201910 September 1884, Queen Victoria of the United Kingdom had signed a Treaty of Protection with the king and chiefs of Akwa Akpa, known to Europeans as Old Calabar. This enabled the United Kingdom to exercise control over the entire territory around Ca1abar, including Bakassi. However, documents released by the Cameroonians, in parity with that of the British and Germans, clearly places Bakassi under Cameroonian Territory as a consequence of colonial era Anglo-German agreements. Even after Southern Cameroons voted in 1961 to leave Nigeria and became a part of Cameroon, Bakassi remained under Calabar administration in Nigeria until ICJ judgement of 2002.\u2019 All I can remember of the 1961 event is that we got to the classroom one morning and our teacher told us that the map of Nigeria has been altered, and he showed us the deep curve in the south-east to reflect that part of the country, opting to join the Cameroons. Years later, Sardauna province in the north also opted to join the Cameroon. We were conscious of these alterations to our map then as pupils, because our teachers made it a point to let us know. Later, they were included in our history books. I hope we still have historians in the country who are compiling present-day events, and the government is funding their researches. Foreigners shouldn\u2019t be, like it was in the past, those who are documenting events in our country. Our descendants have the right to know the country and its past, and how the leaders handled issues of their day. Everything about Bakassi should be well-documented and included in our history books. Leaders of another generation in Nigeria, may want to re-visit the issue, and successfully bring back the people into this country, who knows? They need to have a clear-cut account of what really happened in the different eras. Schools should have well-equipped library which pupils should be encouraged to use, and there should be weekly current affairs classes where topical issues are discussed and debated upon, in order to create national awareness in young people. Merely singing the national anthem and reciting the pledge, are not enough for this. Related",

        "title": "4 gynecology questions girls are too embarrassed to ask about",
        "author": "None",
        "text": "Fear and procrastination are some of the many reasons women delay going to the gynecologist. And when they are finally on the examination table, they shy away from asking intimate questions related to their vaginal health. In fact, research published in a 2009 issue of Midwife revealed women worry about cleanliness, vaginal odor and concern that their gynecologist might discover something about their sex life. Speaking with newsmen, gynecologists explain why women should be more inquisitive instead of saying \u2018everything\u2019s fine.\u2019 1. Why do I lose urine when I cough, sneeze or have sex? Many people think urinary incontinence, or the loss of bladder control, is an issue that only impacts seniors. However, it\u2019s much more widespread, impacting one in three women over the age of 18. \u2018Women in their 20s and 30s are just mortified that when they have sex, sneeze, or jump they lose urine,\u2019 said obstetrician-gynecologist Dr Lauren Streicher, medical director of the Center for Sexual Health and the Center for Menopause at Northwestern Memorial Hospital. Light bladder leakage usually occur when the pelvic floor muscles \u2013 which support pelvic organs like the urinary bladder, the uterus, cervix and vagina \u2013 aren\u2019t strong enough to control the bladder. Reasons for this condition, which is twice as common in women as men, vary greatly. However, some predisposing risk factors include smoking, chronic constipation, alcohol consumption and obesity. \u2018Anyone is at risk,\u2019 said obstetrician-gynecologist Dr Jessica Shepherd, director of Minimally Invasive Gynecology at the University of Illinois at Chicago. \u2018But the people most at risk are women who have given birth, going through menopause or who participate in high impact exercises like horse riding.\u2019 A few ways people can fix this by doing kegel exercises to strengthen their pelvic floor muscles. This involves contracting and holding these muscles for five seconds. 2. Is my labia too long? Dr Streicher said a lot of women are self-conscious about the way their vaginas look. She said when women ask her if things \u2018look\u2019 normal down there, they are usually talking about the labia \u2013 the inner and outer folds of the vulva on each side of the vagina. \u2018The labia, like every other body parts, comes in different colors, shapes and sizes,\u2019 Dr Streicher said, adding that it\u2019s normal for them to be uneven too. She believes this insecurity is partially due to the fact that more and more women can see their labia, thanks to pubic grooming, and are able to compare it to the labias they see online or in porn videos. In fact, there\u2019s been an increase in women going under the knife for labiaplasties or \u2018designer vaginas.\u2019 A report released last month by the Aesthetic science, Plastic surgery and Cosmetic Dermatology Congress revealed that there\u2019s been a 50 percent uptick in people interested in the procedure \u2013 which trimming back the inner lips \u2013 compared to last year. There\u2019s also been a 45 percent jump in the number of labiaplasties performed across the world. When examining their vagina, Dr Streicher makes it a point to reassure that they look normal by saying things like: \u2018I\u2019m looking at your labia now. I see that your left labia is longer than your right and that\u2019s completely normal.\u2019 \u2018I do that because I know women are so self-conscious about the way they look,\u2019 she added. 3. Do I smell or taste bad? Many woman are embarrassed to ask about taste of their vagina because \u2018they don\u2019t want to admit to their gynecologist that they are having oral sex,\u2019 Dr Streicher said. Dr Shephard added that many foods women intake can impact body secretions, such as vaginal discharge and even sweat. She said women should drink plenty of water, cranberry juice and eat citrus fruits like oranges, grapefruits and pineapples if they are worried about the scent of their bodily fluids. This is because food can impact the body\u2019s pH balance. A healthy vagina should have an acidic pH value between 3.8 and 4.5 \u2013 indicating there is a good amount of good bacteria and no overgrowth of bad bacteria that can cause odor and sometimes infection. Vaginas are acidic to suppress the growth of bad bacteria, which is why citrus fruits, which are acidic, can help balance the vagina\u2019s pH levels while foods like and asparagus can disrupt that balance. When it comes to smell, Dr Streicher said many of her clients don\u2019t have an abnormal odor, but they perceive that they smell bad. \u2018Many people are culturally taught that the vagina is a dirty place,\u2019 Dr Streicher said. \u2018And they douche often and we know douching isn\u2019t good for you.\u2019 In addition to telling her clients not they don\u2019t smell bad, she said it\u2019s important to also let them know that if they did have an odor they shouldn\u2019t be putting topical fragrances on their vagina. \u2018If there\u2019s no odor you don\u2019t need to put perfume on your vagina,\u2019 she said. \u2018If there was an odor it would be coming from inside the vagina not on top of it.\u2019 For patients who are experiencing bad odors, Dr Streicher said this could be due to bacterial vaginosis, overgrowth of \u2018bad\u2019 bacteria in the vagina or an imbalanced pH. Dr Streicher said menstruation and sexual intercourse having sex can throw off a woman\u2019s pH balance, resulting in a weird or abnormal smell. She said many pH balance soap on the market are worthless and provide no benefit since \u2018the odor is inside the vagina and not on the vulva.\u2019 Instead, she suggests some women use RePhresh gel to normalize their pH balance. 4. Women want an STI screening but they don\u2019t say anything A lot of women, especially those who are married, are hesitant to ask their gynecologist to test them for a sexually transmitted infection. Dr Streicher said this is because a lot of women are afraid they are going to be judged for putting themselves at risk for catching an STI. \u2018Some married women are worried that asking for an STI will imply that they\u2019ve had multiple partners or that their husband went outside their marriage,\u2019 she explained. Dr Streicher also explained that a lot of women who go to a gynecologist office are under the impression that their doctors automatically perform STI tests during the appointment. This is why it\u2019s important for doctors to ask their patients if they would like to receive a test for an STI. Infections like chlamydia, which can be cured with antibiotics, can lead to infertility if left untreated. Symptoms of chlamydia include abnormal vaginal discharge, abdominal and pelvic pain. However, many women with the illness experience no symptoms at all. Gonorrhea is another treatable STI that can lead to infertility if left untreated. Symptoms of this infection include watery, creamy or slightly green vaginal discharge, fever and heavier periods or spotting. These STIs are common, which is why it\u2019s important for women to be vocal if they have any concerns. \u2018What it all comes down to is women\u2019s insecurities,\u2019 Dr Streicher said, adding that they should seek out gynecologists that they are comfortable with.

        "author": "Tonnie Iredia",
        "text": "By Tonnie Iredia When the Yar\u2019Adua administration promised to give Nigerians thousands of electricity megawatts at the end of its first year in office, officials of that government themselves knew that the game plan was to deceive the people. They were all aware that it was not really a target which their team honestly intended to achieve. Many of us in the group of those being deceived also knew that the public power policy was an outright fraud. But the government of the day like its predecessors had even before the formulation of the policy, rehearsed the arguments it would canvass at the expiration of the fake deadline to justify its premeditated failure. In any case, there is nothing that cannot be rationalized in Nigeria. For example, it is taken for granted that it is to make life more abundant for us that we have to endure incessant and long traffic hold-ups occasioned by the absurd closure of certain portions of any road under construction. It is irrelevant that the same foreign contractors working on our roads do the same job with less public pain in other countries. Who are we, some people would ask to grumble over any inconvenience caused by \u2018go-slow-men-at-work\u2019 when government has graciously opted to work on our roads? To defend government efforts in the area of public power supply is even easier. One way out is to attribute the failure of the policy to the activities of some militants which disrupted the strategic plan. If that does not seem plausible, we can put across some unverifiable evidence such as, that some rivers did not flow well during the season leading to low water level which made the power system unworkable. We can even remove public attention from the project by setting up a probe panel midway to the promised time of delivery to critically examine the immediate and remote causes of the failure of the efforts of the preceding government. Thus, our ingenuity at fabricating official cover-up stories has over the years empowered our leaders to say one thing and do another or do none. To be candid, Nigerian governments have immunity not to be accountable to the people because, the part of our constitution-the fundamental objectives and derivative principles of state policy- which should have made it otherwise is not justiciable. Well, we need to be charitable here and take special note of some of our leaders who have publicly declared their assets even if certain items were concealed. Others have in addition published their audited accounts although no one knows their relationships with the auditors. What is certain however is that despite acclaimed transparency in government, so much impropriety subsists. A good example being the appointment of fake Special Advisers, Special Assistants (some are described as senior) and Personal Assistants. The saying that \u2018those who preach the gospel live by the gospel\u2019 seems to make some sense because everyone should reap where he sows which probably explains why our clergymen today live glamorously on the Bible in their kingdom of God industry. Similarly, those who work for the election victory of a political leader deserve to be patronized by his post-election government. That should not cause ill-feeling because as this column argued previously, such political patronage is tolerated internationally. Our only source of worry is the recklessness with which it is handled in Nigeria. To start with, the number of people appointed into non-existent and nonviable positions without schedule of duties is scandalously high. Some governments are however inventive about some of the appointees like in Oyo State where a blind lawyer was appointed Special Assistant to the Governor on Disabilites. The Cross River State governor has a Special Assistant on Diaspora Matters. Even if that appears to be some kind of dabbling into foreign affairs which is a federal subject, the government reckons that there is a need \u2018to mobilize Cross Riverians, Nigerians and their sustainable partners in the Diaspora to contribute to the development of the state\u2019. Other states have not been as imaginative. For instance, the Bauchi State government until recently had 913 appointees supposedly serving as advisers and assistants to the governor. Luckily, we hear the governor has sacked the ridiculous crowd and reappointed only a few which looks more like the Isa Yuguda we used to know. Similarly, Governor Patrick Yakowa of Kaduna State has since terminated the appointments of 525 political aides made up of 30 special advisers, 45 senior special assistants and 450 special assistants. The dismissals make sense because the appointments were basically fraudulent. In Kano State for example, the immediate past governor had an appointee with the title \u2018Special Assistant I (Political)\u2019. In addition, he appointed three other persons as Special Assistant I (Political Kano North), Special Assistant I (Political Kano Central) and Special Assistant I (Political Kano South). There is also the issue of some of the appointees having the same schedule. During a visit to Enugu State in 2006, it was difficult to determine who we were to relate with \u2013 was it the Special Adviser to the Governor on Media Matters or the Special Adviser on Public Affairs or the Special Adviser on Public Communication? The boss actually said any of them was in order. In some states, the schedule of any special appointee does not really matter. In Ogun State, the special adviser on legislative matters was after two years in office suddenly re-designated Special Adviser on Employment Generation. Perhaps the word adviser has a political meaning different from what we, political novices understand as an expert in a particular field- a kind of consultant, guru or veteran-a counsellor of repute. It is also possible that our perception of what should be the relationship between an adviser and his principal is similarly incorrect following our experience in Lokoja last week when we wanted to reacState. A friend told us point blank not to pass through any of his numerous special advisers and assistants because none of them has access to the Governor. So why do they exist? To make matters worse, the salaries of political office holders in Nigeria are bogusly unrelated to their qualifications and experience. Some have in actual fact, never worked before. But we require enormous moral courage to demand the review of such remuneration which is pittance when compared with the extortion in the National Assembly. Thus, the Egalitarian Mission Africa- a human rights group aptly made the point the other day, that governors who pay numerous attendees such as Special Advisers, Senior Special Assistants, Special Assistants and Personal Assistants not less than N200, 000 per month for doing absolutely nothing should be able to pay N18,000 minimum wage to civil servants. At least, the civil servants are not fake. Our premise is that it is regrettable that governments in Nigeria are involved in the fraudulent practice of sharing money to some people who are deceitfully described as officials but who everyone knows have no job to do. This no doubt negates the fight against corruption. Related",

        "title": "Muslim-Muslim ticket is political arrogance",
        "author": "Ochereome Nnanna",
        "text": "By Ochereome Nnanna THE rumour has been making the rounds that the All Progressives Congress, APC, is plotting to unfold a presidential ticket made up of a Muslim for President and another Muslim for Vice President in the impending 2015 elections. The rumour has it that retired Major General Muhammadu Buhari will be the presidential candidate while his co-leader of the Party, Alhaji Bola Ahmed Tinubu, will be his running mate. Some unnamed top officers of the party have been quoted as dismissing the rumour, as it is already kicking up storms that might threaten the fragile fabric of the newly amalgamated patchwork of three parties. The Presidency is being blamed for this rumour, because the ruling Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, and its supporters have often demonised the APC as the \u201cJanjaweed\u201d and \u201cMuslim Brotherhood\u201d due to the overwhelming dominance of its commanding heights by Muslims from Arewa North and Yorubaland. The APC has always rebuffed this labelling, accusing the PDP of playing the religious card against it because it has long sensed its imminent downfall at the party\u2019s feet. Political sabre-rattling apart, I do hope, for its own sake that the APC will not dream of such double left-handed pairing for presentation to the Nigerian electorate. It will result in one of the most comprehensive defeats in the annals of Nigeria\u2019s presidential votes. It is not just a Muslim-Muslim ticket that will meet this sort of electoral waterloo. Any attempt to concoct a Christian-Christian ticket will fare no better.I do not think that any Christian presidential candidate will even contemplate it because Christians in Nigeria are far more sensitive to fair balancing of political scales than Muslims. Many Nigerian Muslims often assume, without any credible or proven shred of evidence, that their population is more than those of Christians. They are always eager to take daring unilateral steps in favour of their religion, such as the enlistment of Nigeria in the Organisation of Islamic Conference, OIC, in 1996 without the matter being debated at the Supreme Military Council. Other instances include the design of the Presidential Villa with Muslim architecture, the design of Nigeria\u2019s flag in Sokoto Caliphate (Usmaniyya) Muslim colours, the naming of Barbeach road in Victoria Island, Lagos after Ahmadu Bello signifying that he dipped the Koran into the Atlantic as he had boasted he would do, the inscription of Islamic messages in ajami in our currency notes, as well as the recitation of Koranic verses by Muslims before speaking at official public functions, without regard to the multi-religious complexion of such gatherings. In April 1993 after the Social Democratic Party, SDP, convention in Jos, the winner of the Party\u2019s presidential ticket, Alhaji Moshood Abiola, picked his closest rival, Alhaji Babagana Kingibe, as his running mate, thus creating the first Muslim-Muslim ticket for a presidential contest by a major national political party in Nigeria. The ticket defeated its Muslim/Christian rival of the National Republican Convention, NRC, led by Alhaji Bashir Tofa with Dr Silverster Ugoh as running mate. Emboldened by the apparent magnanimity of the Nigerian Christian community in overlooking the anomaly because of the special circumstances of that time, the defunct Action Congress of Nigeria, ACN, created another Muslim-Muslim presidential ticket with Malam Nuhu Ribadu as presidential candidate and Alhaji Fola Adeola as his running mate in the 2011 presidential poll contest. The ACN only got 2.1 million votes, while the more balanced tickets of President Goodluck Jonathan/Vice President Namadi Sambo won with 22.5 million, followed by Muhammadu Buhari/Pastor Tunde Bakare (12.2 million). It is important for politicians to note that the Abiola/Kingibe winning ticket was a mere fluke. Prevailing factors made Nigerians to put aside ethnic, religious, regional and other divisive factors aside to vote for that ticket. Top among these was the fact that both Abiola and Kingibe were popular all over the country and had grassroots appeal each on his own steam. Their cult images transcended primordial borders. Secondly, their opponent, Tofa was a dark horse, and his running mate, Ugoh, lacked popular support even among his Igbo people. Buhari is only popular among the rabble of the Muslim Arewa North, with little horizontal appeal among the elite even in the North. Tinubu is the prevailing political leader of the Yoruba people, but many are beginning to doubt his hold in the zone after the way he imposed family members and cronies in high places in the defunct ACN. Murmurings are getting louder over the marginalisation of Christians in his political fold. The APC has to do something extraordinary to disprove the Muslim-domination tag developing around it or it will become a drag on its electoral fortunes. The truth be told, Nigeria is a multi-religious society. It is a country created to give ethnicity, region and religion their special places of pride. The original founding fathers of Nigeria\u2019s independence, such as Dr Herbert Macaulay and Dr Nnamdi Azikiwe set out to make Nigeria more than a mere geographical expression by fomenting a nation united by common citizenship like the US and other progressive multi-racial societies. But Chief Obafemi Awolowo and his Action Group brought tribalism into the country\u2019s politic, while Sardauna Ahmadu Bello brought Islamic imperialism and Arewa fundamentalism. Between these two, Macaulay and Zik\u2019s nationalism was defeated and Nigeria has lived for ever unhappily after. Political parties that seek to win elections in Nigeria must carefully and strategically balance their tickets between Christianity and Islam and between North and South, East and West. It is not only equity; it is the right thing to do. There will be no shortage of talents from any corner of Nigeria to carry out the balancing act. To say it does not matter is self-deceit. If a section of Nigeria will not accept a Christian/Christian ticket, what makes it think the others will accept a Muslim/Muslim one? The sectarian violence masquerading in Sharia riots, Boko Haram attacks, Fulani militia strikes on Christian-dominated hamlets at night and places of worship in Northern Nigeria cannot promote a political society where religion does not matter. Those who ignore the Nigerian reality and present \u201csingle-cell\u201d presidential tickets must be ready to accept the defeat that awaits them. Related",

        "author": "None",
        "text": "BY EBUN SESSOU One of the experiences Honourable Ramotalahi Akintola-Hassan would not forget in a hurry was when she lost her first husband five years after marriage. She waited for seven years before going into another marriage. Today, she is happily married. She is the Vice Chairman, House Committee on Physical and Urban Planning in the Lagos State House of Assembly. The female lawmaker is currently representing Amuwo Odofin Constituency 2. In this interview, she speaks extensively on personal and official issues. Can you tell us about your backgroundI hail from a village calledIbese in Amuwo Odofin area of Lagos. My late parents were the Akintolas. I had all my education in Lagos before becoming a female lawmaker. I had my first baby at the age of 25. Unfortunately, I lost my husband five years after my marriage. I stayed without a husband for seven years before I re-married in 2006. How were you able to cope without a husband? It was a bitter experience. Those were my seven years of agony and emotional pain. It is only an experienced individual who can better understand and explain those years of agony. I wouldn\u2019t pray for my enemy to experience such. It was that experience that lured me into dating a married man. Unfortunately, the relationship did not last. My late husband was a nice man. He died at a very young age. It was a bad experience. How did you get into Lagos State of Assembly? I worked at Amuwo Odofin Local Government in 1996; I was later posted to Oriade Local Council Development Area (LCDA). But I resigned and and joined Lagos State Internal Revenue Service. I joined politics after the death of my father to keep the family name in politics because he was a strong politician. I contested for the LSHA in 2011 and I won. Today, I have an empowerment programme which caters for the vulnerable children. I have lots of children that are not mine that I finance their education. I love people around me and that is why my philosophy about life is \u201cno condition is permanent\u201d. The fact that I am a lawmaker today does not mean the position is permanent and that is why it is important to always appreciate people. I have learnt a lot of things. People said, I don\u2019t contribute on the floor of the House but I can say categorically that I have learnt a lot as a female lawmaker. There are few individuals who have been in the Lagos State House of Assembly for a long time and those are the people, I under-study so as to know how to approach issues. What are the challenges of being a female lawmaker? And what is your opinion on the notion that women should breastfeed their children exclusively, even as working mothers? When I was a nursing mother, I used to breastfeed my daughter in the morning before going to my workplace and also at night. One might not be able to breastfeed the child throughout the day but I can advise that, it is important to breastfeed our kids. And it is also important to know that the male child tends to love breast milk more than the girl child and that is why men tend to love breast more. As a lawmaker, how do you manage your home front? I go to market and do the cooking myself. I patronise some markets including Mushin, Abattoir among others within the metropolis whenever I want to shop. I cater and maintain my home as a wife. My home is my number one priority. I even wash my husband\u2019s underwears. I do my shopping and cooking personally. Although, I have a house help I don\u2019t maltreat her. Anyone who does evil, will encounter evil and anyone who does good, will encounter good things. Are you satisfied with the number of women in public office and what is your advice for women in politics? I believe in 2015, we will have a female governor and there could be increase in the number of female lawmakers. But women have done a lot in politics and they should be appreciated. We will support any woman who comes out to contest for governorship in 2015. How have you affected people in the grassroots? I have empowered lots of people in my community. I gave out transformers, free GCE forms, JAMB forms to the people in my constituency. I sponsor people to Jerusalem and Mecca every year. I built a borehole in my constituency. I gave out generators to communities. I have facilitated the construction of roads in my constituency by the state government. A bridge has even been approved in Ibeshe by the state government for construction as well. I have a a vocational programme for over 300 people in my constituency. Related",

        "title": "$496m Tucano Jets: Matters Arising",
        "author": "Henry Boyo",
        "text": "By Henry Boyo THE proceedings in the National Assembly, became rather agitated on April 26, 2018, after President Buhari\u2019s letter, which sought approval for the sum of $496m, which had been spent on 12 fighter jets, was read by Senate President, Bukola Saraki (APC) and Speaker, Yakubu Dogara (APC), to members in their respective Chambers. President Muhammed Buhari\u2019s letter confirmed that this amount was earlier withdrawn from Nigeria\u2019s Excess Crude Account (ECA), for the procurement of 12 super Tucano aircraft, in a direct purchase agreement between Nigeria and the United States governments. The problem, however, according to Senator Mathew Urhoghide, Chairman of the Committee on Public Accounts, was that this payment is clearly a breach of Section 80 of the 1999 Constitution, which stipulates that \u201cany amount of money that has to be spent from the Federation Account, must first be appropriated by National Assembly\u201d; according to Urhoghide, \u201cthis one\u201d \u201chas not been appropriated by the NASS and therefore breaches the position of the constitution\u201d, and \u201cthere are serious consequences for such violation\u201d. Senator Urhoghide therefore recommended that, \u201cas a committee, the only thing that we can draw from this is that, we call on you (Saraki) to evoke Section 143 of the Constitution\u201d, as \u201cthis matter does not need to be investigated, it is clear that this offence has been committed by the President.\u201d Senate Similarly, Senator Shehu Sani (APC) described the reported expenditure as a \u201cgross abuse of the Constitution\u201d. Although, Sani did not support impeachment, he, however, suggested that \u201cthe payment be refunded, so that the transaction be started afresh to allow due process\u201d; this recommendation however, seems like another variant of the presently, very unpopular, plea bargain with Treasury Looters. Nonetheless, Senator Sani did not explain how the US government could be made to simply refund the sum of $496m, without heavy sanctions and serious financial penalties for Nigeria. Incidentally, Buhari explained in his letter to the NASS that the $496m was paid without legislative Approval, because the US government had given a payment deadline for the aircraft purchase, otherwise the contract would lapse\u201d. It is not clear why full payment was demanded for aircrafts which will be delivered in 2020. Furthermore, Senator Chukwuka Utazi (PDP) also noted, that \u201cthere is no name to call this (disbursement), except an impeachable offence and we cannot allow that\u201d. \u201cWe cannot stay here and this assembly and Nigerians will be taken for granted. It should not be so, I, (therefore) rise and support the motion for impeachment\u201d. Conversely however, Senator Abu Ibrahim (PDP) described the call for impeachment \u201cas a PDP Conspiracy\u201d and wondered whether any State Governor sought approval from their respective State Houses of Assembly, before spending previous disbursements from ECA allocations. Senator Samuel Anyanwu, however, countered Senator Ibrahim that the issue in question \u201cwas about respect for government institutions and not about politics\u201d. On his part, Deputy majority Leader, Senator Bala Ibn Na\u2019Allah (APC) suggested that Buhari \u201cmight have considered section 83(1-2) of the constitution, which \u201callows the President to make extra budgetary spending in an emergency situation\u201d. Ultimately, the Senate President concluded that there were (actually) two substantive issues: \u201cthe spate of insecurity and the flawed process through which government wanted to tackle it\u201d. Consequently, in view of dissension amongst members, the Lawmakers agreed to refer probe of the $496m withdrawal to the Committee on Judiciary, Human Rights and Legal matters. Furthermore, some House members also kicked against a motion to include the $496m in the 2018 Appropriation bill, which is still pending before the National Assembly. The Chairman House Committee on Ethics and Privileges, Hon. Nicholas Ossai, actually raised a point of order to counter such motion and observed that, \u201cby the procedure of the House, the request for appropriation was belated, because Buhari had already spent the money\u201d, whereas, \u201cSection 80(3) of the 1999 constitution states that \u201cno funds could be withdrawn from the Consolidated Revenue Fund (CRF), except, in the manner approved by the National Assembly\u201d. Ossai therefore concluded that such a motion \u201cis (therefore) not relevant, because this money has already been spent\u201d. \u201cConsequently\u201d, he added \u201cthis matter cannot be discussed at all\u201d. Some other House members, including Deputy Minority leader, Chukwuma Onyema (PDP), also agreed that \u201cthe request was belated\u201d, and warned that \u201ctrying to bend the House rules to accommodate the $496m withdrawal either by a motion or fresh money bill would amount to self indictment\u201d; ultimately, in view of divergent opinions, House Speaker Yakubu Dohara (APC), ruled that debate on such motion should be suspended.\u201d It would be extremely charitable, constitutionally, to ignore the $496m ECA withdrawal, as an impeachable offence by President Buhari, nonetheless, in practice, it would be an uphill task to impeach a President, with a significant party majority in Parliament; unless of course, the present absence of a common amalgamating philosophy, tears the ruling Party asunder, during the political negotiations leading to February 2019 elections. If, however Buhari is impeached, Vice president Osibanjo may not have the requisite political followership and the critical mass, that will guarantee his election as president next year, especially if, the Northern power block, insists that, another candidate from the north should complete Buhari\u2019s slot for a 2nd term in office. It is however regrettable, that the $496m payment process was shrouded in such in consistencies; for example, the Minister of Defence, Mansur Dan Ali, reported on January 25, that the payment deadline for the purchase of the aircraft, was February 2018, but he had also observed that government rejected the related Purchase Terms, because these were stringent and clearly skewed in favour of the US. However, the Minister did not confirm, thereafter, if the contentious stringent conditions were, later, favourably reviewed, before the minister\u2019s report barely two weeks after, on February 5, that the Federal government had already paid $496m to the US government, for the Tucano jets, without mentioning that the funds were actually withdrawn from the Excess Crude Account without the Legislative Appropriation. Ultimately, in response to public outcry on the colossal expenditure, the President\u2019s Special Assistant on National Assembly matters, Senator Ita Enang (APC) reported on April 9, that Buhari had not yet given approval for the withdrawal of the sum of $1b, which he earlier requested from the NASS, to enhance Nigeria\u2019s security apparatus. Enang therefore noted that \u201cas of now \u201cthe process of approving the money for use is inchoate and still undergoing Executive Standard Operating procedure, before laying same before the National Assembly for appropriation\u201d. Ironically, Enang\u2019s explanation has also been exposed as \u201cinchoate\u201d by President\u2019s Buhari\u2019s later confirmation of the withdrawal from ECA in his April 13 letter to the National Assembly.

        "text": "By Adeniyi Ogunfowoke Women who have oily skins don\u2019t really fancy makeup because it turns messy after a few hours. While makeup enhances a woman\u2019s appearance, it is important to ensure it is applied properly to give a matte finish. If you have an oily skin and cannot do without makeup, Jumia Travel portal shares 5 tips to ensure you look good all day long. Apply foundation before makeup Women with an oily skin should always apply foundation before they actually make up. The foundation will cover your oily skin thus preventing the makeup from dissolving. In addition, it will fill the pores on your face and also improve your natural skin tone. It is a perfect pre-makeup tip women with oily skin should regularly practice. Don\u2019t use too much powder You cannot blame someone with an oily skin for over using powder as this will cause any product they put on the face afterwards to last longer. However, this measure can only work for a short period but not for the whole day. If you have got an oily face, you should only apply powder on the shiny spots of your face. Go oil-free Since your skin is oily, it is advisable to avoid oily makeup products. You should also steer clear of fatty foods like chips, fries, and cheese and replace them with the consumption of more fruits and vegetables. Refrain from using harsh lotions It is important for women to know the cream that is suitable for their skin before applying them. Oily skins and harsh lotions are not friends because it doesn\u2019t reduce the oil nor soften your skin. Don\u2019t forget your blotting papers Blotting papers should always be in your bag if you have an oily skin. They are helpful for dabbing the face when the makeup eventually fades.

        "text": "AWKA\u2014THE South Saharan Social Development Organization, SSDO, a non \u2013governmental organization, NGO, and the wife of Anambra State governor, Mrs. Ebelechukwu Obiano, have put smiles on the faces of 50 persons with disabilities by empowering them with equipment and seed money to start mobile phone repaid business. The beneficiaries, comprising 30 males and 20 females drawn from various parts of Anambra State, were trained for three months at the Aguleri Rehabilitation Centre by SSDO, with the support of Oxfam Novib, an international donor agency. \u2022Beneficiaries At an impressive passing out ceremony at Aguleri, each beneficiary received a laptop, a comprehensive mobile phone repair kit and some amount of money from the country director of SSDO, Mrs. Grace Chinegwundoh-Nwobodo, while the wife of Anambra State governor, Mrs. Obiano promised to provide each of them with a generating set to avoid hiccups associated with epileptic public power supply. In her speech, Mrs. Nwobodo said her organization was committed to making development happen for vulnerable people, assuring that anyone who passed through the programme and was empowered, could live full productive life for the over all benefit of the society. The same number of people have also been trained in Enugu State. She said: \u201cThe three months training programme was broken down into two parts, the hardware and software components, to ensure that the trainees obtained the full appreciation of the different working parts of a mobile phone and how it relates to software to become a usable communication device. \u201cThe last part of the training focused on business skills to expose participants to the business environment, business success factors and survival strategies. From the feedback received, the course participants thoroughly enjoyed every aspect of the training. The women in the group in particular were every excited and surprised that they could cope with the technical aspects of the training often times regarded as an exclusive preserve of the men. \u201cThe success story of the programme proves beyond reasonable doubt that there is ability in disability and we at SSDO are indeed very proud to identify with the collective and individual aspirations and achievement of these 50 enterprising Nigerians who, after three months, have completed the training on the repair of mobile phones and have also become computer literate.\u201d Mrs. Obiano, who was elated at the excitement of the beneficiaries, most of who sustained themselves through begging, said her office would collaborate with SSDO to train more people with disabilities in Anambra State, assuring that after the training, she would also provide the beneficiaries with the necessary equipment to enable them fend for themselves. . The governor\u2019s wife said: \u201cI am happy to note that the decision of SSDO to train persons with physical disability is in line with the mission of my pet project, the Caring Family Enhancement Initiative (CAF\u00c9). I sincerely thank the organization for its decision to bring the training to Anambra State. This is an encouragement to us for the little efforts we are making to make life more meaningful for the physically challenged. \u201cI also congratulate the graduates of this training programme and urge them to utilize the knowledge they have gained for their own economic emancipation. It is my hope that they will transfer same to others and when called upon, will help us in training others to become self reliant. \u201cMy pet project, CAF\u00c9, will also continue to partner with the Anambra State government to ensure that we put smiles on the faces of the physically challenged. CAF\u00c9 has already provided assistance, like wheel chairs and walking aids to some physically challenged in the state. We have also provided prosthetic legs and arms to hundreds of physically challenged in the state. Our hope is that we will continue until we have touched as many physically challenged persons as God\u2019s providence will allow us to touch.\u201d Related",

        "title": "@ 50, you can begin anew",
        "author": "Francis Ewherido",
        "text": "By Francis Ewherido As some people clock 50 years, they begin to stare at retirement with anxiety. Many people put in 30 to 40 years before retirement. During these years of active service, some acquire reasonable assets and wealth to retire on. But it is not so for some; turning 50 becomes nightmarish because they realize they are getting to the end of their working life with little or nothing to fall back on in retirement. love This is more common with many small business owners and self-employed people. They have no pension or gratuity; maybe a personal house, another house that brings a little rent, a business with outdated equipment that can only be sold for very little and some money in the bank: These are all they have as retirement beckons. Some have a lot less to retire on. Some people go into a state of panic, while others easily develop high blood pressure. But there is nothing to panic about; you can begin anew. The next decade (from 50 years to 60 years) is very crucial for you, so makes very good use of it. You still have the strength to run around and your contemporaries are still in positions of authority and can be of help. Also, you ought to have acquired experience and wisdom, which should give you some leverage; not to talk of the many natural gifts buried inside you waiting to be exhumed and put to good use. In addition, your trailer-load of mistakes over the years should become a springboard for a new life with fewer errors. At 50, if you are not yet rich in physical assets, you should, at least, be rich in intellectual assets. To be deficient on both fronts does not speak well of your past. But not to worry, it only means you have more work to do within the next decade. At 50 or more, you should be better focused: you are looking for resources to see your children through school and prepare for your retirement. This is no time for foolish pride; remember you are doing (preparing for retirement) what your contemporaries did 10 to 20 years earlier. Doors would be slammed on you, you will answer \u201csir\u201d to people who were still in diapers when you left school, you will be called an irritant old man (can you imagine?); it does not matter. You have bills to pay and a retirement to provide for; these are all that matter. Remain focused. While others are wailing over the recession, get busy thinking and taking advantage of the opportunities recession offers. People sent us into the recession; people will bring us out of the recession. Join the latter group, even if in your little corner. There is a lorry-load of literature on recession. Bury yourself in it and fashion a way forward. Anyway, unlike younger people, you do not have the luxury of time for lamentations. Within this decade, if you have not taken lessons on diversification seriously before, this is the time to do so. Your experience and exposure should guide you in your diversification efforts. You must diversify your sources of income now and during retirement. Nigeria is too volatile and uncertain to rely on one source of income. It is a climb uphill, but you have no choice (Ok, you have a choice: retirement into uncertainty.) Hopefully, your experience and network over the years will make the climb less cumbersome. In this uphill climb, you have to do one of the things you failed to do when you started your working life: delayed gratification, in other words, making sacrifice now for a better tomorrow: your retirement. You are like an over laden ship that is about to sink; lighten the ship by throwing overboard unwanted or nonessential cargo. You need to deny yourself a lot wants and luxuries so that you can keep something reasonable aside for your retirement. You just concentrate on the basics: food, shelter, clothing and others like children\u2019s school fees. The clothing bit should be strictly what you need, while the children\u2019s schools should be good enough and the fees affordable on the long run and in the worst case scenario. Expensive schools do not necessarily mean better schools; do your research. In 1990 or thereabout, a life insurance agent came to sell a life insurance policy to me. I was in my mid-20s with a salary of N700 monthly (N8,400 per annum.) I looked at him and asked: \u201cYou want me to secure my future, when I have not secured the present.\u201d I had a long laugh and dismissed him. If I had this exposure then, I would have taken the policy. Even if I had committed N50 to N100 for premium monthly, I would still have been comfortable. I later took up a life policy when the scales fell off my eyes. If you are in your 50s and you have not, take up a life policy. Talk to an insurance expert; choose a sum assured which when broken down will leave you with a monthly or quarterly premium that you can pay periodically over time. On maturity, your life policy can provide you a lump sum (N10m, N30m, N50m), something reasonable for your retirement. The other side of the coin\u2014good news or bad news, depending on how you view death\u2014is if you die before the maturity of the policy, the sum assured will be paid to your next of kin. In other words, if your sum assured is N50m, but you contributed only N500,000 before you died, what your next of kin gets is the N50m sum assured. With that kind of money, your family is assured of some financial comfort in your absence. Some people argue that return on life policies is far lower than the inflationary rate. That may be true, but if you did not pay this money as premium, you will still spend it on other things one way or the way. Which is better, having a lump sum at the end of the day, though with less value due to inflation or having nothing? To be continued under a different topic. Related",

        "author": "Paul Bassey",
        "text": "By Paul Bassey What a bizarre headline for a sports column. I owe you an explanation. As you are reading this, the victorious U-20 Women National team are less than six hours away from touch down at the Abuja Airport, on board Ethiopian Airlines from the Democratic Republic of Congo. After a 4-0 drubbing of their Congolese counterparts in Abeokuta two weeks ago, one would have expected the second leg match to be a formality, but Coach Edwin Okon would not hear of it. He will rather we forget the first leg and start afresh. The team left Abuja last Wednesday, sporting a business disposition and the Abuja-Accra-Addis-Brazzaville-Kinshasha route did not help matters. For those who have been to Kinshasha before, the Boulevard De Mulumba which links the airport to the city has always been an eyesore, cruel introduction to the country, even as you struggle to pass through a crowded market. Thursday May 17 was not different worsened by the massive road construction going on in the spirit of President Joseph Kabila\u2019s gospel of rehabilitation and modernisation Thursday May 17 is also a public holiday held to celebrate six years of the liberation of DR Congo from the stranglehold of Mobutu Sese Seko in 1997 by Laurent Desire Kabila, late father of the current President. There is joy and politicking everywhere yet history for now is of no interest to the Falconets. All the girls needed was to get to their hotel rooms take a shower and sleep. We pray the hotel will be worth their while. Beverley Hotel is a block of luxury apartments. I was there last year on CAF duty as General Coordinator, Sunshine Stars used the place during their Confedreation Cup Sojourn, so I assured the team that it was \u201cokay\u201d. The tired girls get their rooms, training is skipped, dinner is served and the team retires. Friday May 18 is eventful. The host oblige an early morning training in the main stadium which was repeated by match time, 3.30pm. The pre match meeting is held, and Nigeria suddenly discovers that two of the referees are from Congo Brazzaville!. Protest? We decide not to. Not even Kinshasha referees can stop us from this journey to Japan. Then, catastrophy. News filters out, that the Congolese girls have gone on strike. They skipped Thursday evening and Friday morning training to protest the non payment of their allowances. They say they will not play the match. Newly appointed Sports Minister Banza-Mukalahi Sumdu is devastated. He rushes to the girls\u2019 hotel to plead with them. He says he is just ten days in office that the girls should please give him the benefit of the doubt, they should go ahead and play and leave the rest to him. The girls pray for at least two hundred dollars each and say they will get back to him Saturday morning ( (Match day ) I break the news to the Nigerian delegation. We decide to keep it away from the girls. We do not want anything that will make them drop their guards. I wish our girls knew the efforts put in by the Nigeria Football Federation to guarantee their welfare. Meanwhile we are also in the dark. Will they or will they not play? Newspapers are not published on Saturdays here so there is news darkness\u2026.. Saturday afternoon, the Nigerians get to the stadium, no sign of the Congolese Leopards. Ten minutes later, there are wild shouts of joy as the host team makes a grand entrance to the delight of the few Congolese that had made it to the stadium. The Ethiopian referee signals the commencement of the match and the Congolese react like a house on fire, taking the battle to their Nigerian counterparts in a very aggressive and determined manner all of four minutes. Then it happened. Against the run of play, the Nigerians counter attack. Okobi Ngozi Sonia takes what appears to be a weak shot\u2026\u2026GOAL!!!!!!!! Now the Congolese need to score six to oust Nigeria. \u201cPas Possible\u201d say the French. Japan, here we come! It has taken just fifty minutes to guarantee a FIFA world Cup qualification. After all are we are not losing finalists of the last edition? We go on to score two more goals through Desire Oparanozie and Ordega Fransisca. Icings on a cake well baked in Abeokuta and cut at the Stade de Martyrs in Kinshasha. Take a bow coach Edwin Okon on behalf of your coaching crew that includes Nigeria\u2019s female football legend Florence Omagbemi. Take a bow petite captain Ofoegbu Gloria, followed by Whyte Ibubeleye in goal, Njoku Ugo, Nku Cecilia, Chukwunonye Josephine, Osawaru Jennifer, Adule Charity, Ordega Francisca, Oparanozie Desire, Okobi Sonia, Sunday Ukpong, Nwankwo Chioma, Edoho Blessing, Okafor Ugochi, Adeyemo Ajoke, Orji Ebere, Sunday Lopez and Oshola Lamina. Glory girls all. We walk tall, confidence and proud gait, cheered all the way as the team drives out triumphant from the stadium, with the green white green occupying pride of place. Yes it feels good being a Nigerian. As you punctuate qualification party and retire to take your shower, the joy is amplified as the air waves go crazy heralding the June 3 date that will see P-Square performing at the Sharks Club in Kinshasha. Raw Bank is celebrating 10 years of its operations in the Congo and have decided to reward customers with a high class celebration that will see P-Square entertaining the guests. Tickets will not be sold.

        "author": "Francis Ewherido",
        "text": "By Francis Ewherido At the recently concluded World Pensions Summit (WPS) Africa Special held in Abuja, one of the major issues discussed was bringing the informal sector into the pensions scheme. Imo-pensioners The pension scheme has a tremendous ability to provide the working class comfort when they retire. Over time, government has rolled out policies, the PenCom Act 2004 as amended in 2014 being one of them, to enhance workers welfare, especially when they retire, but many small businesses neglect or dodge their implementation. In doing so, these business owners also shortchange themselves. I will mention only two. The first is the group life policy made compulsory by the PenCom Act for companies employing three or more staff. The company is the policy holder, but the actual beneficiaries are the staff, including the owner. In the event of permanent disability (if the policy is extended to cover it) or death, the underwriters pay the victim or his family a specified sum, usually in multiple of his annual salary. If your annual salary is N6m, you are entitled to N18m, for instance. In the event of permanent disability, the policy provides a reasonable financial cushion to the beneficiary and if death occurs, it ensures the family has some money to carry on. It is an annual policy. The second one is contributory pension scheme made compulsory by the Pensions Act. The act makes it mandatory for employees of companies to be part of the scheme. The company contributes 10 per cent of the employee\u2019s salary while the employee contributes eight per cent monthly to the scheme. Over time, some contributors have accumulated 10s of millions in their pension accounts. If you are 50, a business owner and you are not part of it, you should subscribe today. You can accumulate a reasonable sum over the next 10 to 15years before you retire. The pension scheme is a very serious scheme, the occasional negative stories notwithstanding. That is why it has accumulated about N5.75 trillion within the 12 years it was introduced. It is a win/win arrangement for business owners. It enables you to save for your retirement, while complying with the law. Compliance with Pensions Act and other government regulations also enables you to bid for government jobs. Some big companies also require would-be contractors to comply with the Pensions Act, among others, before they can be registered as contractors. Some people also maintain a retirement bank account where they deposit money periodically. For this to become a veritable avenue to prepare for your retirement, you must be very disciplined and consistent in depositing money without withdrawing. One major advantage of retirement savings accounts in these times of scarcity of fund and difficulty in getting loans is that you can take money from there to fund a contract and return after you are paid, perhaps with some SOP (share of profit ) for the savings account. But issues come in when your finances are lean and you take from retirement savings to pay, for example, children\u2019s school fees. Chances are the money might not be returned to the account. While children\u2019s education is laudable, taking from your retirement account, without putting it back later, negates the essence of the account: preparing for your retirement. This is why some people literally lock up their retirement account and throw the key into the ocean until their retirement (They make it almost impossible to withdraw from the account until the appointed time). Retirement savings bank account is good. These days, the banks have all kinds of accounts and arrangements to accommodate your peculiar needs, but you still must do your due diligence. But I consider the Pensions account more advantageous. This is because some people cave in under intense financial pressure to withdraw from their retirement bank accounts. That is not possible with your pensions account until a specified time and compliance with specified requirements. I have been concentrating on ages 50 to 60 since last week. Does it mean people must retire at 60? No way! Some people are blessed with good health and work into their 70s and even 80s. The founder of Kentucky Chicken, Colonel Harland David Sanders, started KFC in his 60s! But we must also face reality. Many people get incapacitated in their 60s; some suffer debilitating ailments, others are not just strong enough to run around, while some lose appetite for work. You do not want to delay preparations for your retirement until you are in your 60s. Ideally, working after 60 year should be voluntary, not out of compulsion or fear of hunger. If you have the strength and zeal to carry on great; if not, let there be something to fall back on. Some readers might also be wondering, does this writer read his Bible? Yes, he does. The Bible is replete with verses enjoining us to take care of our parents, especially in old age. St. Paul in 1st Timothy 5:8 described those who do not provide for relatives (including parent) as worse than unbelievers. But as I was writing, I heard the story of an old woman, a mother of 12, who begs to eat. The children have abandoned her. I strongly feel it is an obligation for children to provide for their parents in old age; the parents are entitled to it after all the sacrifices they make for children from cradle to adulthood. But what if the children do not and you have no option B? That is partly why I have never believed in children taking care (financially speaking) of parents in old age as a first option; it should be the last option. That period of life is too delicate and I would rather be in charge. I always admire retired people who still pick their bills. All that we have been saying since last week\u2014life policy, pensions account, group life policy and retirement saving account\u2014are without prejudice to whatever arrangements you already have. These might include real estate, stocks, farms and other investments. Some investments provide monthly returns, others quarterly, while some are annual. But the bottom line is that even in retirement, you should have multiple streams of income to ensure you are not stranded. Related",

        "author": "Emeka Obasi",
        "text": "By Emeka Obasi Fifty years ago, a young man fighting on the side of Biafra during the Civil War entered record books when a Saladine Armoured tank was named after him,post humous. Corporal Nwafor, of B Company, 29 Battalion, 54 Brigade under 11 Division became a dead hero among his people. War-affected police officer cheer as they receive pension It was June 30, 1968. Brothers, Nigeria and Biafra, were at war. Federal troops were advancing to Onitsha from Enugu, shelling and firing from tanks. At Ugwu Nwasike, Ogidi, about 20 kilometres to the commercial town, the overwhelmed Biafrans were almost giving up when Nwafor hit target. He fired the only anti tank weapon available to the entire brigade, a 73mm bazooka and it hit an advancing saladine. A second tank which tried to engage reverse gear fell into a ditch. The Biafrans tried to retrieve the tanks in a bloody fight that ensued. In the process, Nwafor, lost his life. Biafra gained the weapons of mass destruction. The saladine was named Corporal Nwafor. Probably the first time an armoured tank would be named in the memory of a Non Commissioned Officer. That battle earned the GOC of the Biafran 11th division, Col Patrick Chiedu Amadi, promotion to the rank of a One-star general. Col. Conrad Nwawo, of 13th division was also promoted to the rank of Brigadier. Brigade commander, Maj. Linus Ohanehi, was overlooked. A memorial was held for Nwafor in Umuoji. While service was going on, a Nigeria Air Force bomber appeared in the air. The priest looked up to God and asked everyone not to panic but remain inside. All but one man did. He was the only one hit by a bomb. Biafran engineers had to work on Corporal Nwafor before it could go back to the battle field. From Umudike, headquarters of Research and Production[RAP] emerged a rebranded war machine. When the hard vehicle came out, it was given to the 45th armoured battalion, commanded by Maj. Juventus Chijioke Ojukwu whose troops were based at St. Silas School, Umuahia. One remarkable thing about Corporal Nwafor was that the soldier who manned the Browning machine gun attached to it, was 16-year-old school boy, Sasa Nwoke. His studies at Government Secondary School, Afikpo were halted by the war. The Ohafia lad joined the Biafra Army on January 29, 1968 and was identified as BA 61832. Nwoke\u2019s family did not know the day he finally made it to the army. It did not have anything to do with the fact that his elder sister was married to Major Emeka Ananaba, of the Biafran commando Division. Corporal Nwafor, the armoured car, was one of the few the Biafrans had. In the beginning there were Red Devils before they captured a made in France Panhard just as saladines, sarasins and ferrets also came. And the deadly vehicles were given names like Oguta Boy, Uzuakoli Boy and Ndidi. While Nwoke was firing for Corporal Nwafor, his friend, Sylvester Etta, from Obubra, was the gunner for Oguta Boy. Behind the wheels of Corporal Nwafor was, Daniel Lawrence, an Ikom boy born to an English woman, from Liverpool. His battle name was \u2018Pampas of Argentina.\u2019 Nwoke and Lawrence did a lot with Corporal Nwafor. They fought from Uzuakoli to Ikot Ekpene, from Okigwe to Port Harcourt and back to Owerri. The lads saw death, they defied death. Corporal Nwafor died in battle, or was \u2018injured\u2019 and could not continue with the war. That was in July 1969 at Ohuba on the way to recapture Port Harcourt. It fell into a ditch. Col. Olusegun Obasanjo, was GOC of Nigeria\u2019s dreaded Third Marine Commando division which the Biafrans christened \u2018come and die.\u2019 According to Lt.Col Alabi Isama, Obasanjo sent Lt. Col. Godwin Ally, an Obubra man, to confront the Biafrans. He lost 1,000 soldiers and was lucky to come out alive. The GOC also survived but there was rumour that he died and some of his loved ones went in search of his body at the University College Hospital[UCH], Ibadan. Corporal Nwafor, the soldier, represented bravery which is the hall mark of soldiering. There were warriors on both sides who are alive today, 48 years after the war. Officers like Alabi Isama,Alani Akinrinade,Assam Nsudoh, E.A. Utuk, Archibong and August Okpe. Okpe was Chief Pilot of the Biafra Air Force and was 26 when hostilities ceased in 1970. The story of the Biafra Air Force must be told. They had no single aircraft in July 1967 as the war started. Okpe, from Ihiagwa, son of a Second World War veteran and now father of an American officer who saw battle in Kuwait as part of Operation Desert Storm, was one of the 16 pioneer cadets of the Nigeria Air Force in 1963. He trained in Canada and the United States respectively. It took the lion hearts of Captain Ibi Allwell-Brown, Mark Odu,Sam Inyagha and Onuora Nwanya to hijack a Nigeria Airways F-27 plane, piloted by the duo of P. Singh and Tokunbo Williams on April 23, 1967. The flight originally bound for Lagos from Benin, was diverted to Enugu. That was Biafra\u2019s first aircraft. Willy Achukwu invented Ogbunigwe, served as bomb. Swedish humanitarian, Count Carl Gustav Von Rosen, later brought many minicons, MFI-9B, better known as Biafran Babies. Biafra, despite the superior air power of Nigeria backed by Egyptian pilots, flying Russian MIG 17s, which could not help them in 1967 war with Israel, stayed airborne till the end. Capt. Okpe was brilliant in the air and also saw but survived death severally. Somewhere around Ifitte Ukpo in 1969, he was as good as gone. When he defied anti aircraft fire and landed there were holes all over his fighter jet. He received the Military Cross from General Emeka Ojukwu. Allwell-Brown,was lost on January 7, 1970 around Awka on his way back from a mission to Ughelli. Goddy Njoku survived just like John Chukwu, who later died in Nigeria as a Squadron leader, re- absorbed by General Yakubu Gowon. Related",

        "author": "Bisi Lawrence",
        "text": "By Bisi Lawrence It would appear that we now have a sort of reprieve from the pangs of our anxieties about the imposition of the 5000 naira note on our slender economy, but we can only wait and see. It would also appear that the profligacy of a \u201csupreme sports retreat\u201d would be visited on us just for the purpose of convincing (or deluding) ourselves that we are doing something whereas we will achieve nothing in the end. There are a number of people who know what to do and who would achieve if they are asked to work for sports \u2014but you can rest assured that would neither be consulted nor assigned. We shall still be here in 2016 after the Samba in Rio. I entirely disagree with those who are calling for the sack of the Governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria, Alhaji Lamido Sanusi. Rather they should recommend him for a place in the next national honours list. He is qualified. If the assurance that no contract award has been made for the printing of the awful 5000 naira note and the minting of new coins had not been linked with the Presidency in the double-headed announcement made about the cancellation, or suspension, of the plans to foist the desire of the Central Bank officials on the country, we would have hesitated to believe it to be true. After all, the President is said to have approved the proposal, a fact over which Okoroafor, a senior official of the Central Bank has been flexing his muscles. It is somewhat clear right now, however, that the obnoxious proposal will not be executed, which is what a very tiny minority of officialdom is fuming at the mouth to achieve. At the best, we are now left with this \u201cSword of Damocles\u201d hanging over our heads, while the CBN is supposed to educate us on how to receive the money it did not instruct us how to earn. All the same, far removed from speculations about the consideration of \u201cimpeachment\u201d, we are inclined to believe that President Goodluck may have one or two points of explaining sticking out on his plate right now. Although it is claimed that no contract has been awarded for the execution of the proposal, the approval of the President appears somewhat precipitate at a time like this; the economy is not enjoying the best of climate; the State Governors are taking the Executive court over fiscal matters; the staple foods of the Middle Class\u2014 or whatever remains to be so described\u2014are undergoing a rising spiral in cost; so many pensioners are still clamouring for their unpaid benefits; there is talk of a diversification of the economy while there is a promotion of a \u201ccashless\u2019 economy in which the cash is hard to find, in any case. So Okoroafor would now thrust a jumbo-size denomination of the currency into our pockets and tell us it does not necessarily make us spend more than we intend to. Anyone who thinks that way must need a \u201cshrinker\u201d. What more explanation is there to give the citizens of this country about this issue, anyway? What is there to examine that has not been subjected to extensive scrutiny, under klieg lights even? The so-called suspension, in fact, seems to be no more than a mere ploy to play for time, and one feels extremely uncomfortable that the President appears to be at ease with it. This then is democracy\u2014 the government of the people, by some people, for certain people. I entirely agree with the Senate President, David Mark that, under normal circumstances, there should have been resignations, forced and voluntary, following the recent revelation of the deplorable neglect of the National Stadium in Abuja. But hardly anything is under \u201cnormal circumstances\u201d these days. If not, what are the credentials of the man appointed as the Stadium Manager, in the first place? The man in such a position must be one of the best in Africa to match the stadium\u2019s status and prestige on the Continent. He must be a man of outstanding professional qualification and exceptional working experience which would make him suited to the discharge of his responsibilities, and at home with the esteem of his standing. Yes, heads should roll, but from the height of what shoulders? There is no doubt that the man was out of his depth in these circumstances that place undue premium on ethnicity and sectionalism in the consideration of suitability for purely professional positions. These are not \u201cnormal\u201d times, sir, and that is one of the reasons why we came back from the London Olympics clutching a handful of air. But the mess at the Abuja Stadium produced a result that fully illustrates the theme of our discourse here last week. The appalling situation was exposed by the press and was swiftly followed by positive action. Contracts are being awarded for the immediate improvement of the facilities, and it is hoped that the stadium would no longer be allowed to fall into disrepair again. Even if that sounds like a vain hope, it still has some footing in the urgency with which the issue has been addressed up till now. All the same, one must admit that it does arouse some cynicism of course, because the case of the Abuja Stadium is typical of the plight of sports facilities, particularly stadiums, in Nigeria. A ready example is the Surulere Stadium\u2014 also called \u201cNational\u201d unabashedly \u2014which was easily the best in West Africa in the early \u201cseventies\u201d when it came into use. Ghanaians shed their traditional uppity stance to actually admit that it was much better than the Accra Stadium, and stooped low to openly copy some of its features. The Accra Stadium has gone on to better since then. The Surulere Stadium would disgrace a slum facility today. It is not that the press has allowed it to rest neglected and misused but, unfortunately, it has lost its pride of place to her Abuja counterpart, and important public figures like the Senate President now feel far removed from it.. We just let things go to seed\u2014that is the way it happens. Jack Warner, the West Indian international soccer administrator, visited Calabar in 1997 and reveled in the pristine perfection that would delight a World Cup crowd. The Youth World Cup was indeed on the cards to take place in Nigeria two years later and he returned some ten months before the event merely to confirm the golden impression he had experienced earlier, only to find a rot that left him almost speechless. Speaking in a trembling voice, he uttered an unqualified disbelief, not only in the possibility of such a deterioration within a year, but at the prospect of getting the stadium ready within another year for the YWC, otherwise known as \u201cNigeria 99\u201d. But we did and Warner declared the feat \u201cThe Eighth Wonder of the World\u201d. That is what we are\u2014\u201dWonder Mongers\u201d. Of course, we will get the Abuja Stadium back to its \u201c:spick-and-span\u201d condition in no time at all; after all, the Calabar Stadium is now considered one of the best in the country. But why let it slide to almost total ruin, in the first place? Simple; it was no longer used for its purpose. While a stadium is pointedly used for competitions, it also serves to prepare for competitions. It houses gyms and practice tracks and pitches, and provides the upkeep of an environment for sports. Its presence is therefore an emotional stimulus, as well as a psychological motivation for sports participation. No matter how expansive or diminutive they may be, sports grounds arouse the passion to dip your oar in and prove something in yourself. In the halcyon days of Youth. Clubs in Lagos, although there were no stadiums attached to the centres, the facilities provided for the indoor-games gave impetus to the engendering of the competitive spirit which manifested in healthy rivalry in the arena. An even better example is what developed in Bendel in the seventies. That was before it was split into Benin\u2014which became Edo State\u2014and Delta. The Ogbe Stadium was transformed into a meeting-place for sports activities\u2014not just for competitions. It soon attained the status of a Mecca for sports buffs around Benin City. It was crowded every day of the week to the extent that it hardly left any room for serious preparations for systematic preparations. That when that great visionary of a leader stepped in. Let me pause here briefly to wish Samuel Osaigbovo Ogbemudia more years of happiness and usefulness to his fatherland as he attains the status of an octogenarian. The former Ogbe Stadium has been fittingly named for him, but he still stands out as a case for certain citizens of excellent merit who miss out in the consideration for high national honours. \u201cBig Sam\u201d, as we used to call him behind his back, knew the value of sports as an instrument of nation building. He succeeded in welding Bendel, a loose mix of various ethnic communities, into a firm front united by a common zeal for sports excellence. He knew that he first had to provide the interest to participate, and so moved away from overcrowded Ogbe Stadium to the fabulous Afuze facility. There he created a sports factory which produced champions in every sport. He set a wonderful example for the entire nation in achieving a common purpose through sports which, regrettably, still has not been heeded. Imagine for how long a sprinkle of medals from London \u2013 just say four or five \u2013 would have kept us looking in the same direction. Consider the boost in the morale of the national spirit that such a situation would have provided. But it would all have to start from the facilities of the stadium, just as Ogbemudia visualized it, and made it work There are other necessities\u2014equipment, coaching, competitions and a show of appreciation and encouragement among other incentives \u2014to put our sports in the place where it should be, and we may consider these later. But, please, save me the pain of \u201cretreats\u201d. I have been through a few in the past, and they do not even hold a candle to honest-to-goodness seminars and workshops. But if you have these ineffectual time-wasters on the brain and must have them, then call in the experts and the experienced ones, Ogbemudia should be in such a group. I believe that, even at eighty, he still has unique contributions to make. There is also his successor in office, the incumbent State Gvernor, Adams Oshiomhale, who can go ahead and revive Afuze, with the cooperation of his Niger counterpart. And there is also a man like Awoture Eleyae. He is still alive and, at a time like this, worth his weight in gold\u2014not just silver or bronze, but real gold. And there are a few others with a pedigree that will dispel your anxieties about organizing a revival of sports in this country. They will do a good job. They have been there before. They are not political animals and their whelps who cannot even keep a stadium in good shape. But, once again, please leave out the carnivals. Jamborees are joyful festivals for worthwhile celebrations and cannot be made to replace occasions for hot, sweaty palms and sackcloth .. That is what sports now demands Expect more on sports. You asked for it. . Time out Related",

        "title": "$500M EUROBOND: FOR WHOSE BENEFIT?",
        "author": "Les Leba",
        "text": "By Les Leba Finance Minister, Olusegun Aganga confirmed to an audience of financial correspondents and experts last week that the government will float a $500m Eurobond before the end of January 2011. To this end, the Finance Minister and his entourage have planned roadshows traversing markets in Europe and the United States to promote Nigeria\u2019s credit worthiness and thereby facilitate subscription for the $500m loan. It is, of course, common commercial wisdom to borrow for productive purposes especially if internal revenue sources are inadequate for critical current needs. It is also rational expectation that the benefits from the object of a loan would eventually make both the service and final repayment of the capital sum relatively painless. In other words, it would be inexplicable or indeed, irrational if one embarked on a borrowing spree without a productive object for the application of the fresh loan. It is worse still if such a \u2018purposeless\u2019 loan is incurred in spite of the availability of substantial idle own funds, which enjoy minimal dividends in the accounts of potential subscribers of your current loan application. Of course, Aganga, whom we are told, cut his teeth with one of the financial world\u2019s highly rated brokers is certainly not a novice and must know his onions, even if his former employers\u2019 expert credentials were rubbished in the wake of the global financial crisis in the recent past. In other words, Aganga would be the last person one would expect to commit the faux pas of borrowing money that he does not have need for, especially when the proposed 10_year loan may attract interest rates and management fees around 10% annually. In addition, it is inevitable that the cost of the proposed roadshow for Aganga\u2019s entourage and the fees and commissions payable to the brokers and other intermediaries responsible for midwifing the $500m Eurbond would easily deplete the net sum received by up to 10%. But as I said, Aganga is no neophyte and most certainly has a purpose in mind for the $500m or is it $450m expected inflow. Hear him, \u201cthe aim of the 10 year bond is to set a benchmark in the global market for Nigeria, rather than to raise funds; meaning the pricing is considered more important than the timing!!\u201d Well, this might be too esoteric for over 90% of Nigerians who earn less than $2/day to comprehend, but what our financial expert is saying here in layman\u2019s language is that \u201cI know we don\u2019t need this $500m, after all, we still have over $30bn idle funds as reserves; indeed, I am also aware that these reserves are saved abroad and earn less than 3% interest with some of the same potential subscribers to our bond issue; and yes, I know that Nigeria may end up paying up to $50m as annual service charges and management feeson the possibly $450m net that would come as fund inflows into our coffers after deducting cost of road show and other fees and commissions payable to Deutshe and Citibank (the book runners for the bond issue) and other obligations to Barclays Capital and FBN Capital who will serve as Financial Advisers for this loan; but I believe it is right to take this loan so that future loan applications from Nigeria will be guided by the market price we will pay this time out\u201d. As you can deduce from the above, Aganga is really a sharp financial wizard in the same mould as most of the ministers who held the Finance portfolio in the last three decades! Indeed, no finance minister during that period has succeeded in providing an enabling economic environment for industries to thrive and stem the rising tide of unemployment or indeed, pursue fiscal policies that have improved the social welfare of our people, but they all always seem to have excelled in mismanaging our huge export earnings and frittering away much of our reserves to both internal and external buccaneers all the same. It is obvious from the present exercise, Nigeria may pay back $1000m for the $500m loan (less charges) within the next 10 years. In the event that Aganga admits that we don\u2019t \u2018need\u2019 this loan, imagine what the potential interest payments of $500m could do to some of our universities or indeed, health institutions! Well, maybe we should be a bit more charitable or objective, after all, Aganga has indicated that the joy of estimated $500m interest payments within ten years should make it possible for both Nigerian public and private sectors to access international loans, with a guided price tag, for which cumulative benefits in the future would more than compensate for the consolidated cost of the imminent Eurobond! Besides, it is common wisdom that banks would normally be eager to lend to an already financially buoyant client than one who is desperate for cash, so Aganga may be led to believe that our loan bid will be fully subscribed with our current, relatively healthy reserves of over $35bn and our existing rich crude oil resources as optical collaterals. But the point is that these two factors by themselves are sufficient to assure potential lenders of our ability to repay our loans and the issue of pricing should really be left to be resolved between Nigerian public and private sector loan seekers and the international market at the appropriate time of their needs! In any case, it is not as if the much sought after benchmark is an iron cast guarantee such that the rate which evolves from the current Aganga \u2018escapade\u2019 will also be the most competitive rate possible or that future rates will not exceed this benchmark at the actual point of need based on market realities at that time! In any case, assuming that the $500m bond is fully subscribed, so what happens? The Finance Minister has indicated that there is no immediate crying need for ths money, since we have large idle funds, so what do we do with the money? Well, to start with, we can add it to our existing reserves, which as earlier indicated, are usually kept in minimal interest yielding accounts (certainly with interest dividends at a fraction of the cost of the proposed Eurobond); hazy financial logic, you would say! Alternatively, it could be captured in the accounts of the Central bank, and subsequently released as part of the monthly allocations to the three tiers of government after the dollar value has been substituted with naira at current exchange rates; thereafter the CBN would proceed to auction the $500m to commercial banks and bureau de change. After all, this is currently the ultimate fate of our dollar reserves under the current monetary framework, notwithstanding that this arrangement opens the door to wrong exchange pricing mechanism, round tripping and capital flight and also provides a great avenue for the funding of smuggling and money laundering! Indeed, less than a week after Aganga\u2019s dinner interaction with financial correspondents on the \u2018need for the bond issue\u2019, the CBN offered $300m for sale at its foreign exchange auction of Monday 10/1/2011. About the same time, the CBN had paid the naira equivalent of $1bn from the illegally constituted excess crude account to the three tiers of government on the eve of New Year\u2019s day; the resultant naira sum of N150bn complemented the monthly statutory allocations to increase the cash available in the system and weaken the naira rate and quickly gulp the $300m offered in the first set of dollar auctions in 2011. Thus, the $500m Eurobond will inevitably trace the same path and exacerbate the contradictions in our fiscal and monetary policies with adverse impact on industrial regeneration, employment and social welfare. In spite of the above implications, Nigerians will wonder why Aganga is so motivated to commit Nigeria to this unnecessary and expensive loan. Indeed, if additional funds are required for some specific critical infrastructural purpose, the government has indicated that about $4bn soft multilateral loans, with low interest charges of between 1 _ 3% and about 20 or more years gestation are currently available for the picking! So why must we choose the hard and much more expensive option. However, this modus operandi may not come as a surprise to keen observers of Nigeria\u2019s ballooning domestic debt. Indeed, on the establishment of the Debt Management Office, DMO (read as Debt Creating Office) just over three years ago, Nigeria\u2019s domestic debt was barely a N1000bn, consisting mainly of debts to local contractors. Soon after the exit from the Paris/London Club debt burden, the DMO came on stage and their immediate mission, according to the purposes indicated in their loan prospectus, was also to create a \u2018benchmark\u2019 (do you recognize that word?) and deepen the domestic market for long term loans. Indeed, the purpose, as similarly defined by Aganga in floating the current Eurobond is to create a benchmark for Nigerian bonds in the international financial market. Any reference to the prospectus published by the DMO soon after its establishment will also confirm that the loans sought for were not intended for any positive, tangible or practical application that had the potential of jumpstarting our economy or addressing our infrastructural deprivations. Today, Nigeria\u2019s domestic debt has quadrupled to about N4000bn in less than four years and yet, there is no visible positive impact on our people\u2019s welfare! The bonds issued by the DMO were often generally oversubscribed and inevitably the commercial banks were the main patrons; inexplicably, the same banks that government frantically pumps trillions into their coffers will be beneficiaries. The bond issues were popular because of the mouthwatering yields of between 10 _ 15%, rates which were well in excess of what you would get from the international financial markets. Currently, the Central Bank and the DMO jointly continue to borrow almost N200bn monthly from the same banks that enjoy tremendous government patronage with billions of naira deposits whenever allocations are paid to the three tiers of government. No doubt, Aganga\u2019s $500m Eurobond will, like the domestic counterpart, be oversubscribed and the Finance Ministry will celebrate its success, but the truth is that unusually high yield expectation will be the prime motivator for subscription to these sovereign bonds; again, the same motivation as with the domestic bond issued by our Debt Creating Office! Inevitably, with the current debt consolidation by another arm of government; i.e. AMCON, in mopping up banks\u2019 toxic assets, Nigeria\u2019s debt burden is primed to accelerate our march into an excruciating debt trap as the National Assembly, our constitutional watchdog continues to slumber and fiddle. Once again, the banks will be the major beneficiaries! SAVE THE NAIRA, SAVE NIGERIANS! Related",

        "title": "$500m eurobond: For whose benefit?",
        "author": "Henry Boyo",
        "text": "By Henry Boyo THE Finance Minister, Olusegun Aganga and his entourage have planned roadshows traversing markets in Europe and the United States to promote Nigeria\u2019s credit worthiness and facilitate popular subscription of a proposed $500m/Euro loan. It would be inexplicable and irrational for anyone embark on a borrowing spree without a productive object for the loan; it is worse if such purposeless 10-year loan attracts near double digit interest rates and management fees annually especially when substantial idle own funds, attract minimal returns when domiciled, as in this instance, with the potential subscribers of our fresh loan application. Furthermore, the cost of the planned road show and the fees and commissions payable to brokers and other intermediaries in loan process could easily regrettably erode the loan net sum by possibly up to 10%. Naira-Dollar Potential subscribers According to Aganga \u201cthe aim of the 10 year bond is to set a benchmark in the global market for Nigeria\u2019s borrowings,\u201d rather than to actually raise funds; thus, in these case, the pricing is considered more important than the timing!! Thus, in layman\u2019s language, Aganga is saying that \u201cwe know we don\u2019t need this $500m loan, since we have over $30bn reserve base; indeed, I am also aware that our reserves which usually earn less than 3% interest are generally domiciled in the overseas account of some of the potential subscribers to our present bond issue; and yes, I also know that we may end up paying up to $50m as annual service and management charges on the estimated net inflow of $450m, after deduction of road show cost, plus fees and commissions payable to Deutshe and Citibank (the book runners) and other obligations to Barclays Capital and FBN Capital, Financial Advisers for this loan; but it is a \u2018sensible\u2019 loan because future loan applications from Nigeria will be guided by the market price we will pay this time out\u201d. However, we may ask, if the $500m bond is fully subscribed, to what purpose will the funds be applied? Evidently, the amount could supplement existing reserves, which as earlier indicated, earn returns which are a fraction of the cost of the proposed Eurobond; hazy financial logic, you may say! Alternatively, the funds may be captured as Central bank income which would be, subsequently released as part of the monthly allocations to the three tiers of government after the dollar value has been substituted with naira, at current exchange rates; thereafter the CBN would traditionally proceed to auction the same $500m to commercial banks and bureau de change. Unfortunately, this traditional application of our dollar reserves, triggers a distorted exchange pricing mechanism, round tripping and capital flight and also facilitates the funding of smuggling and money laundering! Indeed, less than a week after Aganga\u2019s interaction with financial correspondents on the \u2018need for the bond issue\u2019, the CBN simultaneously promptly offered $300m for sale at its foreign exchange auction on Monday 10/1/2011. Notwithstanding the above, CBN had on new year\u2019s eve, also allocated the NAIRA equivalent of $1bn sum withdrawn from a controversially constituted Excess Crude Account to the three tiers of government; invariably, the resultant N150bn exchange value complemented the regular monthly statutory allocation to significantly expand naira liquidity, such that the sum of $300m subsequently sold by CBN in the first dollar auctions in 2011 became oversubscribed to further weaken the market naira exchange rate. Similarly, the present $500m Eurobond will inevitably also trace the same path of naira substitution to exacerbate the contradictions in our fiscal and monetary policies, with adverse consequences on industrial regeneration, employment and social welfare. Specific critical infrastructural purpose In view of the above complications, Nigerians will wonder why Aganga is so motivated to commit Nigeria to such an unnecessary and expensive loan. Indeed, if additional funds are required for some specific critical infrastructural purpose, government has lately indicated that about $4bn soft multilateral loans, with low interest charges of between 1 \u2013 3% and with 20 or more years\u2019 gestation are currently available for the picking! So why must we choose the hard and much more expensive option! However, this odious modus operandi of forex management may not surprise keen observers of Nigeria\u2019s ballooning domestic debt. Indeed, when the Debt Management Office, DMO (read as Debt Creating Office) was established just over three years ago, Nigeria\u2019s domestic debt was barely N1000bn, and consisted mainly of outstanding payment to local contractors. However, soon after the controversial exit from the Paris/London Club debt burden, the DMO came on board, and their immediate mission, according to the purposes of loans indicated in their prospectus, was to create a \u2018benchmark\u2019 (do you recognize that word?) and to deepen the domestic market for long term loans. Similarly, Aganga had also defined the purpose of floating the current Eurobond as that of creating a benchmark for Nigerian bonds in international financial markets. The DMO\u2019s initial offer therefore unequivocally confirms that the loans also sought were not intended for any positive, tangible or practical application that could jumpstart our prostate economy or even address our infrastructural deprivations. Today, Nigeria\u2019s domestic debt has steadily galloped and quadrupled beyond N4000bn; yet, there is still no visible positive impact on the economy and our people\u2019s welfare! Not surprisingly, DMO bonds were usually oversubscribed while the commercial banks were primarily, usually, the main patrons; ironically, therefore, the same banks that government, persistently frantically and actively supports with trillions of cheap interventions funds have also become the major beneficiaries of government\u2019s debt obligations. The DMO issues were usually popular because of the mouthwatering yields of between 10 \u2013 15%, rates which were well in excess of what you would get from the international financial markets or indeed from funding the real sector. Currently, the Central Bank and the DMO inexplicably continue to borrow almost N200bn monthly from the same banks that enjoy tremendous government patronage with the hundreds of billions of naira free public funds domiciled with them, whenever monthly allocations are paid to the three tiers of government.\u201d The above is summary of an article published in Vanguard Newspaper in January, 2011. Postscript 2017: Nigerian\u2019s debt burden is currently above $57bn! The amount may actually approach $90bn or more, when contractors and AMCON toxic debts which are in excess of N5Tn are also captured. However, as was the case in 2011, Kemi Adeosun, the Finance Minister will celebrate the over subscription of the recent $1bn bond; regrettably however, she may have inadvertently triggered a new cycle that would further deepen our descent into a horrendous debt trap.

        "text": "By Denrele Animasaun \u201cNon nobis solum nati sumus. (Not for ourselves alone are we born.)\u201d -Marcus Tullius Cicero 1st of October was a muted affair across the diaspora and in many households in Nigeria. It helps to be honest that, in the last couple of decades, there has been nothing of note to celebrate. Yes, may be for few not for many. In PMB\u2019s national speech: did strike a worthy note and tone: \u201cOver the years the country has gone through trials and tribulations, but October 1st is always a day for celebrations.\u201d I don\u2019t disagree much with PMB but with this, I don\u2019t think October 1st is a day for celebration; we should celebrate when the citizens are thriving and not merely surviving. Frankly, am done with this freedom malaky; the day we got our freedom from colonial rule is wearing a bit thin. We are not slaves and we need to stop acting like slaves. We are Nigerians and should by now realise that we hold our future and that of coming generations in our hands. We cannot hold our future to colonial times, we as people exist before they came. Buhari cutting the Nigerian anniversary cake in Maiduguri Having said that, I believe that PMB gave good and objective account of the state of the nation. PMB; \u201cWe should remind ourselves of the recent journey from 1999 \u2013 2015, when our country happily returned to democratic rule\u201d. Yes, we have come a long way and sometimes we lose sight in how far we have come and the reminder helps put things into perspective. He reminds us that oil boom has gone boom; \u201cHowever, in spite of oil prices being an average of $100 per barrel and about 2.1m barrels a day, that great piece of luck was squandered and the country\u2019s social and physical infrastructure neglected. We were left with no savings and huge infrastructure deficit.\u201d The gravy train has left the platform and of course, we know that many have squandered our commonwealth, in time these thieves in fine clothing will get their comeuppance and many are getting so uncomfortable that they want to blame everyone and create chaos. PMB seems to be their target but the man is unshakable and they should know that by now. PMB reminded everyone that with freedom comes responsibilities; \u201cIn the past two years, Nigeria has recorded appreciable gains in political freedom. A political party at the centre losing elections of state governor, national assembly seat and even state assemblies to the opposition parties is new to Nigeria. Added to these is complete freedom to associate, to hold and disseminate opinions. Such developments clearly attest to the country\u2019s growing political development. But like all freedoms, this is open to abuse.\u201d So those who think he has lost his bite, the general is playing a waiting game and it is better to give people enough rope to hang themselves and they are doing a good job as it is. For those who take silence as inaction, they are in for a rude awakening and they better get used to it; this Sheriff ain\u2019t leaving town. To those who call for restructuring, PMB has this to say; \u201cRecent calls on re-structuring, quite proper in a legitimate debate, has let in highly irresponsible groups to call for dismemberment of the country. We cannot and we will not allow such advocacy.\u201d \u201cAs a young army officer, I took part from the beginning to the end in our tragic civil war costing about two million lives, resulting in fearful destruction and untold suffering. Those who are agitating for a re-run were not born by 1967 and have no idea of the horrendous consequences of the civil conflict which we went through.\u201d \u201cI am very disappointed that responsible leaders of these communities do not warn their hot-headed youths what the country went through. Those who were there should tell those who were not there, the consequences of such folly. I totally agree with PMB. I wrote extensively about restructuring and my take is: some people are looking to make money on the back of the masses and in its place create more chaos and havoc across the nation. This has always been their stock in trade. They do not have the best interest of Nigerians at heart. They have always thought about what they can take from Nigeria and not what they can help to build for Nigeria for the better. Shame on them and their acolytes. The major progress has been the work of the armed forces in the reduction of insurgency and the displaced; on security, Nigerians must be grateful to our gallant Armed Forces for rolling back the frontiers of Boko Haram\u2019s terrorism, defeating them and reducing them to cowardly attacks on soft and vulnerable targets. PMB mentioned; \u201cOur Armed Forces in an effort to enhance the operational capability of troops of Operation Lafiya Dole have established mobile strike teams in the northeast. These will ensure the final push to wipe out the remnants of Boko Haram. \u201cIn addition, through targeted air strikes most of the leadership and identified logistics bases and routes of the insurgents have been neutralized\u201d. PMB delivered on some his election pledges to dismantle Boko Haaram and he is well on the way to rid them of all their hiding places. Crucially, it is clear that some states are diversifying and growing food crops for its citizens and also to trade, this is really good news. With continuous planning there is no reason why Nigeria cannot be one of the food basket of the continent for that PMB said :\u201dEqually commendable are contributions of the governors of Ondo, Edo, Delta, Imo, Cross River, Benue, Ogun, Kaduna and Plateau states for their support for the presidential initiative for palm oil, rubber, cashew, cassava, potatoes and others crops.\u201d I for one know that this speech will be scrutinised for years to come as a time Nigeria turned a corner. PMB left citizens with a feeling that collectively we can make a difference and why shouldn\u2019t we? We are Nigerians after all; \u201cI call on all Nigerians to combat corruption at every turn. By not asking for and refusing to accept a bribe, by reporting unethical practices or by blowing a whistle, together we can beat corruption. \u201cThe government for its part will work for accountability at all levels \u2013 federal, state and local governments. Change will then be real.\u201d This is the time many Nigerians have been wishing for, when Nigeria was getting better but it would get better without everyone pitching in. The psyche of Nigerians will change when they lift each other up, kicking corruption to the kerb, we should seek for excellence and not mediocrity. The choice is really ours to make. but I know what I want to do. That\u2019s Not My Job! This is a story about four people named Everybody, Somebody, Anybody and Nobody. There was an important job to be done and everybody was sure that somebody would do it. Anybody could have done it, but nobody did it. Somebody got angry about that, because it was Everybody\u2019s job. Everybody thought anybody could do it, but nobody realized that everybody wouldn\u2019t do it. It ended up that everybody blamed somebody when nobody did what anybody could have done. 57 and Still Counting \u2026.. I understand that Ms Diezani Alison-Madueke, the former minister of petroleum resources, is requesting to be brought back to face trial in Nigeria. That is not going to happen anytime soon if the Attorney General of Nigeria has anything to do with it. The Attorney General, Abubakar Malami, said Ms Madueke is already facing charges of money laundering in the United Kingdom, \u201cit is important to face the charges there than for her to come as a mere witness in a case in Nigeria\u201d. This is not looking too good for Alison-Madueke who hot -footed it from Nigeria, as PMB took office as she caught wind that her past dealings were to be scrutinised and she would have to face the humiliation of the courts. She begged and wooed everyone she knew that could influence PMB but to no avail, so she left anyway in the guise that she was receiving treatment and then went on a shameless elaborate ruse of playing the cancer victim. She was milking sympathy from the Nigerian populace, who many were quick to forgive her financial transgression because of supposedly terminal condition. Oh, what deceitful web we weave when first try to deceive! Now the astonishing level of thievery is out in the open, the net is closing in, she thinks coming home means it\u2019s better the devil you know, newsflash for Ms Madeuke; she better think again. Nigeria then is not Nigeria now. Yes, if you do the crime then you will do the time. Ms Madueke always thinks a couple of steps ahead of the game and that\u2019s why it took a long time to cotton on to her ways. Now, so she has filed a suit at a high court in Abuja seeking to be joined in an on-going money laundering involving her associates. She better think again. Ms Madueke wants to force the government to extradite her to Nigeria from the UK. She is definitely running scared as she knows that the international authorities would unearth all her shady dealing and she will most definitely do time and a very long time too . She will also get a well-deserved worldwide coverage and she does not want that. That would be disgraceful for her and how dear Nigeria permits her to wash her dirty linen in public! She should know the boat have sailed on that one, the world and its cousin knows she siphoned a large amount of the nation\u2019s commonwealth so, how delusional can this lady be? This is a lady who had callously pillaged and denied many people in the country a better standard of life and now she has the temerity of seeking refuge and sanctuary. She and her brood were rolling in money and flying private jets at the drop of a hat as it is the common thing to do. She has no conscience and lacks insight. Possibly, she may be downright arrogant with some level of pathology because she knew fully well that she can get away with it as she knows many people in high places in Nigeria most worryingly she may also hold some secret to many other monies held by others in past and present administration. Some people should be very afraid indeed. She tried but she should know by now that she is on her own and she can squeal as much as she wants, the same fate awaits her fellow hoodlums. So where on earth are these civil liberty groups come from who are vocally supporting her extradition to Nigeria, it\u2019s suspicious as it is usually the other way round. It is laughable that anyone in their right mind would want to support or request that she is given trial in Nigeria? Who are these people and what are they on? The Attorney General response to the media after the Federal Executive Council (FEC) meeting; the federal government will not take any decision that will jeopardise what the UK government is doing. The truth of the matter is that the government is doing something especially on issues of corruption and litigation in Nigeria and outside the country, and it went on; \u201cConsidering the fact that there is an existing understanding between Nigeria and other countries especially United Kingdom on the recovery of stolen funds, you cannot say government is not doing anything. It does not have to prove a point, it should ensure that the lady receives the full weight of the law. FEC concluded that if the government feels strongly that there is need to bring Mrs Diezani Alison-Madueke to Nigeria to face charges of corruption, government will not hesitate to do that. Malami also dismissed suggestions that Ms Madueke might not get fair hearing; \u201cthe issue is not about fair hearing now, we are talking about investigation first and it is not within Mrs Diezani Alison-Madueke\u2019s power to ask the federal government to bring her to testify in any case in Nigeria,\u201d Now, I don\u2019t know about you, but I am sure Ms Madueke has more tricks up her sleeve and she has got stupendous and offensive amount of capital at her disposal, and she is not afraid to use it. Some Nigerian lawyers are getting from her illegal proceeds. For the likes of Ms Madueke , times are indeed changing! \u201cThe Nigerian situation is made worse by deep economic problems, itself a result of our political instability. Good men are not coming forward. If this country dies and it will die if we don\u2019t take care but I have not seen the salvation yet. And my heart bleeds for the deprived. We cannot go back to colonisation besides, I do not like being colonized by anyone anymore and it does not matter who- Kola Animasaun. Related",

        "author": "Rotimi Fasan",
        "text": "By Rotimi Fasan It\u2019s not every day that academ-ics celebrate their birthdays. But it was an occasion for celebration a fortnight ago when Bashiru Okesina, medical doctor, professor and current Vice Chancellor of Osun State University, marked his birthday. It was his 60th milestone and one that friends, colleagues and relations of the professor of medicine thought should be celebrated in a modest way. And so it was that they came together to celebrate the life of a man they agreed has impacted on them in very different but positive ways. By virtue of his professional background as a teacher and medical doctor, Professor Okesina seems naturally programmed to be conservative. He looks it and plays the part. But his faith must also be a factor in his conservatism. Okesina is a muslim with a capital M. He makes no bones about this but doesn\u2019t wear this on his sleeves either. O yes, he dresses and looks like a committed Muslim but even this does not have that in-your-face quality that some give to it. He seems content to \u2018live and let live\u2019. Bashiru Adekunle Okesina It must therefore have been quite an effort for him to be part of the event organised for him, modest as it was. He nevertheless enjoyed himself. That much was clear from the way he danced to the music of the five-man live band that ushered him into the league of sexagenarians. But for the fact that they were introduced by the master of ceremony, the bit known about his immediate and extended family would probably have gone unremarked. He did not seem eager to publicise their presence even when there can be no doubt that he is proud of his achievements in that regard. I can only move in the realm of conjecture based on observation when I comment about Prof. Okesina. I know him, but only from a distance. But even the bit I know of him confirms my perception of his person as a man not given to elaborate displays and noise-making. I first met him in close proximity about a year ago, during a visit I made to his house with the former Dean of the Faculty of Humanities, now Provost of Adeyemi College of Education in Ondo, Prof. Olukoya Ogen. His part of town is within walking distance of but separate from the part of the rich and well-to-do of the area. He lives, so to speak, on the fringe of wealth. His house, a medium-sized one storey affair, was nested in the midst of houses you would see in any other part of town. There was nothing to suggest it was the home of a Nigerian big man. If the house looked modest enough from the outside, the interior itself proclaimed quiet modesty and dignity. It was entirely unpretentious and uncluttered with the gaudy ostentation typical of the homes of people of his status. When he spoke, he did so without a conscious attempt to make an impression beyond, perhaps, that which showed him as stating nothing but the truth as it comes from within him. Same was his laughter- deep and entirely heartfelt. He didn\u2019t appear to mind a good laugh at his own expense. These are the more obvious qualities to be seen and admired in him. It is this apparent simplicity of personality that might make the casual observer not to take note of Okesina in a gathering. But this could be easily checked by his grandfatherly beard which commands instant attention. Not even his beard, though, could conceal the fact of his simplicity and obvious contentment with life. This quality has no doubt stood him in good stead and must have contributed in no small terms to his present status in life. A 60th birthday is surely something to celebrate in a country where life expectancy is just over 40 years. And for a man whose rise from the relative obscurity of Okuku must have been no less heroic than his desire to become a medical doctor, a 60th birthday is indeed worthy of celebration. Yet, this celebration is also a reminder that a lot still needs to be done and achieved. As the guest lecturer at his birthday, professor of history at the University of Ibadan, Charles Adesina, asked rhetorically, \u201cWhat would Bashiru Okesina be remembered for in the years to come?\u201d History must surely have a lot more to report about him than the fact that he distinguished himself as an academic and medical professional who once had the privilege of heading a higher institution as vice chancellor. This fact cannot be lost on the professor. In just about a year and half on the saddle of vice chancellor he has demonstrated the right drive and will to succeed. But beyond the will to succeed, Prof. Okesina cannot be said not to have seen the need for improving on what he met upon appointment. Critical areas for intervention include improvement in the quality of students offered admission. There has been much talk about a general drop in the quality of graduates from Nigerian universities. That problem often begins from the primary and secondary levels. While universities may not be in the position to intervene at these lower levels, they can at least do something by way of ensuring effective gate keeping in terms of candidates offered admission. Staff training and development is also an area that cannot be discounted. Many universities in Nigeria today are poorly resourced in terms of qualified manpower and personnel. The minimum threshold for teaching qualification, a doctor of philosophy degree, is one most Nigerian universities fall far short of. Osun State University has a well-oiled staff training programme. But this programme can be made more aggressive by quick provision of additional support for lecturers in training positions. Lecturers, especially those in training, ought not to be overburdened with lectures. Also not to be discounted is the issue of staff sponsorship for local and international conferences. Many university lecturers are today intellectuals in name alone. This is not for want of talent or intellect. But there is little or no avenue for sponsorship to attend conferences. Where this is available, as with the bit that is being provided by TETFUND, the process of accessing fund for conferences has been grievously politicised and corrupted. A world class university is not just a matter of sloganeering. It calls for active commitment on the part of its managers. True, the university carries more staff and student portfolio that requires far more spending than was necessary in the first five years of its existence. But rather than being a matter to cause discouragement, the advantage that comes with that has been mentioned by the Vice Chancellor and should be harnessed. Happy birthday, Mr. VC Sir! Related",

China which housed a quarter of humanity, including 500 million peasants who were generally illiterate with no access to healthcare, electricity or schools, was forced on a diet of opium by Britain. When the people protested against their being turned into an ocean of drug addicts by the British traffic in opium, Great Britain sent a punitive force by 1842 to \"protect free trade\"\u009d. China was a semi colonial country occupied by nine countries.Young Chinese patriots joined a secret anti-colonial movement \"The Society Of Harmonious Fists\"\u009d better known as\u00c2 the \"Boxers\"\u009d. The Boxers uprising in 1900 was put down by an expeditionary army of eight countries: the United States, Austria, Italy, Britain, Japan, France, Russia and Germany. They imposed an annual indemnity on China for Boxer \"crimes\"\u009d. On October 10, 1911 the Manchu dynasty which had ruled the country since 1644 was overthrown by the Kuomintang,\u00c2 the political party led by Sun Yat-sen who ruled until 1925. A power struggle followed with General\u00c2 Chiang Kai-shek emerging victorious three years later. He had served in the Japanese army and trained in the Soviet Union . After consolidating, he executed hundreds of his communist allies. The rest communists fled and began to congregate at Chingkanshan. These included their leader, Chou En-lai, Mao Tse-Tung who was to emerge the overall leader, and Chu Teh who moulded what became the Red Army. Although accepting the Marxist-Leninist ideology that the Working Class would lead the revolution, Mao argued that in the case of China which was semi feudal with multiple colonial masters\u00c2 and a relatively small workforce, that task would fall on the rural populace, the peasantry. The revolutionaries were few, weak and were the government's for the taking, which was precisely what Chiang Kai-shek decided to do in 1930 by ordering that the \"bandits\"\u009d be wiped out. The government evacuated villages and built new ones with barbed wire. So the revolutionaries were isolated from the populace, could not recruit new members or replenish supplies including food; they faced complete annihilation. Rather than commit mass suicide by fighting\u00c2 or surrendering, they decided to undertake what became one of the most audacious and stunning manoeuvres in military history; to evacuate 100,000 fighters and their families from the Kiangsi Province in the south to the northern Shensi Province. What became the legendary Long March began in October 1934, covering 12,500 kilometres across numerous rivers and snow capped mountains with the fighters under constant air\u00c2 and ground attacks. It lasted 12 months with only 30,000 of the fighters surviving. The Japanese which had occupied the Manchuria in 1931 invaded the rest of China in December 1937. Although the government and communists temporarily allied to fight the Japanese, they were no match; over 15 million Chinese died in this and the Second World\u00c2 War. Japan was defeated by the allies and the Chinese civil war resumed with the revolutionaries being seemingly no match. Mao assessed the Kuomintang (government) as being extremely powerful; it had the support of the world's powers, its army which was perhaps the largest in the world, was modern, well-equipped and trained by the world\u00c2 powers, and it controlled \"\u2026the key positions or lifelines in the politics, economy, communications and culture of China\"\u009d. In contrast, Mao said: \"Our (revolutionaries) political power exists in scattered and isolated mountainous or remote regions and receives no outside help whatsoever\u2026The Red Army is numerically small, its arms are poor, and it has great difficulty in obtaining supplies such as food, bedding and clothing\"\u009d. But how did they defeat the mighty Chinese army? It was a combination of ideas, superior military strategy and tactics, belief in a just cause and unparallel patriotism. For them it was a just war necessary to cleanse the land and enthrone a people-centred system Mao said \"The aim of war is to eliminate war\u2026that is to oppose war with war\"\u009d. The revolutionaries abandoned the cities and urban centres, operated in the rural areas and succeeded in getting the government troops to over-stretch themselves and their supply lines. The rebels adopted guerrilla strategies which was summarised in Mao's maxim: \"The enemy advances, we retreat; the enemy camps, we harass; the enemy tires, we attack; the enemy retreats, we pursue\"\u009d. He also told them: \"Oppose fixed battle lines and positional warfare, and favour fluid battle lines and mobile warfare\"\u009d. From 1948 the revolutionaries began to isolate the strongholds of government forces and the following year, switched from guerrilla warfare to direct battles. In the major battle of \"Huai \"\u201cHai\"\u009d fought in the walled towns of Yungcheng and Suchow, they inflicted serious injuries on government troops who lost over 500,000 men. With these victories, the revolutionaries became unstoppable taking Tientsin and Beijing in January 1949, Nanking the then capital in April followed by Shangai in May and finally Canton in October. The Chiang Kai-shek government fled to Formosa (Taiwan) where American forces protected, and is still protecting it from being routed. On October 1, 1949 the victorious revolutionaries led by Mao proclaimed the new Peoples\u00c2 Republic of China. Chou En-lai was Prime Minister and Mao was party chairman and Head of State. Mao who was interested in classical studies, poetry, development of ideology and putting down his thoughts stepped aside as Head of State in April, 1959\u00c2 with Liu Shao-chi taking over. Following serious ideological differences, Mao in 1965 regained the presidency, carried out the Cultural Revolution and purged Shao-chi and others who were toeing a different line. Chou En-lai the Prime Minister since the revolution who was seen as Mao's likely successor died in January 1976 predeceasing\u00c2 Mao who died on September 10, 1976 aged 83. Both men early in life found their historical mission and fulfilled it. In the process they\u00c2 made their country a model of development which even enemies cannot ignore and completely redirected world history. Related",

        "title": "What does it mean to be a fisher of men ?",
        "author": "Femi Aribisala.",
        "text": "By Femi Aribisala. The gospel will lead far more people to condemnation than to salvation. David counsels that when God speaks once, we should hear him twice. (Psalm 62:11). That does not mean twice literally, but several times. Similarly, Jesus maintains we must forgive our brothers seventy times seven times. (Matthew 18:22). That does not mean four hundred and ninety times, but indefinitely. Therefore, when God speaks, we should review what he says again and again. Because we have listened to God as we do to men, we have missed a lot of what he has been saying. God does not think like men, and he does not speak like men. His thoughts are not our thoughts; his ways are not our ways. (Isaiah 55:8-9). Therefore, when he says something, we must be careful to make sure we understand exactly what he is saying. Fishing men Jesus says to his disciples: \u201cFollow me, and I will make you fishers of men.\u201d (Matthew 4:19). We have heard about this and talked about it. We have been singing about being fishers of men since we were little children in Sunday school. But should we not pause for a moment and ask what Jesus means by saying he will make us fishers of men? Is it wise to jump to the conclusion that he wants to turn us into exceptional evangelists and mega-pastors using combine-harvesters to bring men into the kingdom of God? The distinction between a fisher of men and a Saviour of men is important. However, this distinction is not understood by most Christians who presume erroneously that a fisher of men is a saviour of men. We know who fishermen are. They are fishers, not of men, but of fish. But now Jesus talks of fishers, not of fish, but of men. So to start with, we need to determine what it means to fish men. How does a man fish men? What does he do with the men he \u201ccatches?\u201d God as fisherman Once we look to the bible for answers to these questions, we are in for a rude awakening. In quick order, we discover to our surprise that when God fished men in the scriptures, it was never for salvation: \u201cBehold, I will send for many fishermen,\u201d says the LORD, \u201cand they shall fish them; and afterward I will send for many hunters, and they shall hunt them.\u201d (Jeremiah 16:16). Amos echoes this: \u201cBehold, the days shall come upon you when he (God) will take you away with fishhooks, and your posterity with fishhooks.\u201d (Amos 4:2). The net was a weapon of warfare which gladiators used to hamstring their opponents in combat. Therefore, to be a fisher of men scripturally is to be an instrument of God\u2019s judgment. God says of disobedient Ephraimites: \u201cWherever they go, I will spread my net on them; I will bring them down like birds of the air; I will chastise them according to what their congregation has heard.\u201d (Hosea 7:12). Solomon echoes him: \u201cLike fish taken in a cruel net, so the sons of men are snared in an evil time.\u201d (Ecclesiastes 9:12). Once caught, fishes end up in the frying-pan and eventually in someone\u2019s dinner-table. The same applies to men with regard to the gospel. As fishes are taken unexpectedly in a net, so sinners are taken by the gospel. The prophetic design in preaching the gospel is that it will lead far more people to condemnation than to salvation. Trap of the gospel Hear and understand: God has designed the gospel in such a way that sons of God will receive it but men will reject it. Jesus tells his disciples: \u201cIt has been given to you to know the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven, but to them it has not been given.\u201d (Matthew 13:11). Isaiah says: \u201cThe word of the LORD was to them, \u2018Precept upon precept, precept upon precept, line upon line, line upon line, here a little, there a little,\u2019 that they might go and fall backward, and be broken and snared and caught.\u201d (Isaiah 28:13). The same person who sends us to preach the gospel also tells us beforehand that men will not accept it. God said to Isaiah: \u201cGo, and tell this people: \u2018Keep on hearing, but do not understand; keep on seeing, but do not perceive.\u2019\u201d (Isaiah 6:9). This scripture is repeated more times in the bible than any other scripture. John says: \u201cThey could not believe, because, as Isaiah says elsewhere: \u2018He has blinded their eyes and deadened their hearts, so they can neither see with their eyes, nor understand with their hearts, nor turn- and I would heal them.\u2019\u201d (John 12:39-40). Accordingly Jesus, the word of God, is a double-edged sword. (Hebrews 4:12). Simeon, the prophet, prophesied that Jesus would cause people to fall before causing them to rise: \u201cThen Simeon blessed them, and said to Mary his mother, \u2018Behold, this Child is destined for the fall and rising of many in Israel, and for a sign which will be spoken against (yes, a sword will pierce through your own soul also), that the thoughts of many hearts may be revealed.\u2019\u201d (Luke 2:34-35). Stumbling stone Couched in this manner, the greatest trap of all will not be the devil: it will be Jesus. Many will stumble because of failure to understand and receive Jesus. Isaiah says: \u201cHe will be as a sanctuary, but a stone of stumbling and a rock of offense to both the houses of Israel, as a trap and a snare to the inhabitants of Jerusalem. And many among them shall stumble; they shall fall and be broken, be snared and taken.\u201d (Isaiah 8:14-15). Christians are mistaken in failing to recognise that it is the false gospel that fills the churches while the true gospel empties the churches. (John 6:60-66). The true gospel is preached as a testimony against men. Thus, Jesus says to his disciples: \u201cWhoever will not receive you nor hear you, when you depart from there, shake off the dust under your feet as a testimony against them. Assuredly, I say to you, it will be more tolerable for Sodom and Gomorrah in the Day of Judgment than for that city!\u201d (Mark 6:11). It is worse to hear the word of Jesus and reject it than not to have heard. Jesus says: \u201cIf I had not come and spoken to them, they would have no sin, but now they have no excuse for their sin.\u201d (John 15:22). Through the gospel of the kingdom of God, all men are fished to condemnation; but sons of God are saved. The word of Jesus that men reject is precisely what will judge them on the last day. Jesus warns: \u201cHe who rejects me, and does not receive my words, has that which judges him- the word that I have spoken will judge him in the last day. For I have not spoken on my own authority; but the Father who sent me gave me a command, what I should say and what I should speak.\u201d (John 12:48-49). It is therefore imperative that Christians should magnify the words of Jesus in our lives. Only Jesus has this testimony from God: \u201cThis is my Son, whom I have chosen; listen to him.\u201d (Luke 9:35). Related",

        "title": "War against which corruption?",
        "author": "Hilary Okoronkwo",
        "text": "By Hilary Okoronkwo IN the eyes of the average Nigerian, a full frontal war against corruption is being waged by the current administration of President Muhammadu Buhari. Reservedly so, there are a few of us who strikingly reminisce what appears to be the same choosy confrontation on corruption staged by preceding administrations including Buhari from 1983 to 1985. A war against corruption, any war for that matter being pursued by any individual or a government for that matter must have clearly stated objectives. The objectives should be conveyed to all and sundry. In this case, only President Buhari and those close to him knows what the scope and strategy is. Corruption by elected and selected officials in Nigeria is a cancer that has practically destroyed the entire rudiments of the Nigerian society. Nigerians opportunely grumble about the unsavoury effects of corruption but seems to stop there for all undetermined and exhibited intents and purposes. When it is time to hold our leaders accountable for their actions, our pejorative predisposition automatically switches into selective, confused and sometimes irrational mode. Privately we all agree that corruption is bad and should be eliminated. However, depending on who the culprits are and the circumstances, there appears not to be a generally accepted template for which all corrupt exploits are viewed and measured. In my treasured realm of Nigeria, you may not be duplicitous in the eyes of the law even after it is apparent that you invented nothing and are living above your means. Even if you illegally acquired or diverted public wealth, the following are some of the many available options that allow looters to enjoy the loots of their labour. How not to pursue the war \u2022While in office it appeared you \u201cperformed\u201d and stole just a \u201clittle\u201d. The definition of little may well be in billions of Naira. The political landscape you \u201cserved\u201d may have received trillions of Naira in revenues for the eight years of your administration and no one cares that a good amount of it were unaccounted for. Accusations of helping yourself by exploiting public funds to create a personal website fell on deaf ears and your nomination as minister scaled through the Nigerian Senate with relative ease. \u2022You can convince the perpetually susceptible Nigerians that you were already rich before assuming office. \u2022You can be bold enough to declare that you don\u2019t really give a damn about corruption and go as far as declaring that corruption is not stealing. You are connected directly to the proprietors of the media houses who are receiving huge subventions from misappropriated arms funds. \u2022 You possess the staying power to ignore your \u201closer\u201d critics and remain relevant by being solidly connected with those that matter in the system. As an important member of the political party in power, no one in their right thinking EFCC mind could accuse you of being corrupt let alone visualise holding you accountable for anything. You are simply relevant enough and too important to be disgraced. \u2022 You characteristically grease the palm of the influential media operators and pay your tithe to spiritual merchants. \u2022 You ignore Nigerians who are jealous of your grand accomplishments. Seek and obtain immunity from prosecution from a friendly federal high court in Nigeria. Nigerians have wide-ranging scales and dislocated viewing lenses to measure corruption. Since we cannot agree on what corruption really is and who the corrupt may be, we the people, by default empower every government including the Buhari administration to establish low bars in fighting corruption. Unless there are moves and ideas that the Buhari administration is yet to share with Nigerians, it is my every measured estimation that this government is blowing hot air wasting our collective time fighting a partisan, selective, unacceptable and imprudent war against corruption. Not too long ago, when Olusegun Obasanjo was president, most of us were hoodwinked to believe that corruption was finally being confronted. In an unprecedented turn of events, a former Inspector General of Police was charged and convicted of stealing from the Nigerian Police funds. At least one serving Governor was removed from office, charged and convicted of embezzling public funds. Through all of these, while Nigerians cheered more corruption was being perpetuated inside government and public offices. It was as if former President Obasanjo allowed corruption to thrive. He manipulated the looters and intimidated them in a way that almost propelled him to an illegal third term. We later found out that those who challenged Obasanjo or are considered too close to his enemies were prosecuted to the full extent of the law. Those who openly did his bidding were allowed to enjoy their loot. The point here is not to make any comparison between Obasanjo and Buhari\u2019s approach to fighting corruption. A recognizable parallel is that both are grossly inadequate and are a complete waste of time and resources. It is true that no amount of retribution will serve as a deterrent to eliminating corruption in a society that offers no other reasonable alternatives. Our institutions are too dependent on the government of the day and they need to be encouraged to become a force for good that serves all Nigerians. The ICPC and EFCC were virtually on an extended leave of absence under the Jonathan administration. Things were so bad, the immediate past Chairman of EFCC was accused of converting looted assets recovered from corrupt officials. As Nigerians we pretend to be smart but the rotten state of social and political environment says exactly the opposite. This verdict also portrays us as self-serving individuals without any appreciation of what collective interests are. When our failures are presented to us, we become evasive, defensive or even angry. Most Nigerians are excited that the former National Security Adviser, Sambo Dasuki is being exposed. Every time a new recipient of the $2.1 billion bounty is exposed, it seems to confirm what we suspected to be true all along. Through all of experiences leading up to now, I am yet to confront manyNigerians who share the big picture mentality. Some will say, if it wasn\u2019t for President Buhari, we will never know. Knowing that Dasuki diverted funds meant for arms procurement is one thing but then what? Olu Falae, Tony Anenih, Emmanuel Iwuanyanwu, Iyorchia Ayu, Jim Nwobodo, Bode George, Bola Tinubu, Raymond Dokpesi, and Nduka Obaigbena among many others have all been sharing public funds for a very long time. In return, they are national awardees for their participation while we cheered. In 1984, Nigerians woke up one morning to the rude awakening that a former Director of the National Youth Service Corp (NYSC), then Army Colonel PK Obasa and a few privileged others misappropriated about 200 million Naira. Adjusted for inflation and exchange rate fluctuations, that amount in 1980s could be worth more than Colonel Sambo\u2019s $2.1 billion dollars. To put this into better perspective, the exchange rate of the Naira was at par with the British Pound when the crime was committed. I have no idea what became of Obasa. He could well be holding a traditional chieftaincy title that is immune to any form of prosecution or public ridicule. This administration will have wasted our time again if the following are not looked into. \u2022 The government should as a matter of immediate exigency come up with strict campaign finance policies and collaborate with the National Assembly to pass them into law if the existing laws are not tight enough . \u2022 Both APC and PDP should disclose how much they raised along with the sources to prosecute the last general elections. \u2022 Initiate complete overhaul of all institutions so that they can self regulate. \u2022 All Naira notes are printed and appropriated with equal values. There is no difference between a Naira that should have been used to purchase arms and another meant for road construction or a hospital project. We should attach the same level of disgust and disdain to all misappropriated public funds. \u2022 This administration is acting like an island on its own. The Nigerian people are being entirely kept in the dark. A few weeks ago, we were told that corrupt Nigerians were returning looted funds that are being deposited in the Central Bank. As of this moment, we do not know who those faceless Nigerians are and how much have been returned. I have to presume that all Nigerians concur with me that President Muhammadu Buhari rode to power on the financial backing of corrupt Nigerians. To convince us that he is serious about fighting corruption, he needs to come out publicly and disclose how much was donated either directly to him or his presidential campaign and who those people are. This selective inarticulate or quarter loaf approach to fighting corruption is not going to get us anywhere. My name is Hillary Okoronkwo and I am not and have never been affiliated with the Peoples Democratic Party. I actually endorsed Muhammadu Buhari for President. *Hillary Okoronkwo lives in Michigan,USA. Related",

But 20 years ago he had to forfeit nearly half a million dollars to the U.S. Treasury Department after being named as an accomplice in a white heroin-trafficking and money-laundering ring that stretched from West Africa to the US Midwest. Although his case has been bandied about the Nigerian press for years, Tinubu\u2019s involvement in a federal drug and racketeering investigation waged jointly by the DEA, FBI, and IRS has gone unreported elsewhere, even after his ascendancy to Karl Rove-like status last month. A recent gauzy Financial Times profile of him, for instance, neglected to mention that two decades ago Tinubu was identified as a bagman for two Nigerian heroin movers who operated out of Chicago and Hammond, Indiana. They are Adegboyega Mueez Akande and Abiodun Agbele, Akande\u2019s nephew, who was exposed to law enforcement after selling white heroin first to Lee Andrew Edwards, another dealer later jailed for trying to murder a federal agent, and then to an undercover cop.\u201d</p><p>---- Michael Weiss Reporter for Daily Beast (US Journal) Monday April 27, 2015.</p><p>Nigeria's Number One Corruption.</p><p>\"PIB Debate: North Controls 83% of Oil Blocks\"</p><p>by Henry Umoru and Joseph Erunke</p><p>\"Abuja - Chairman Senate Committe on Rules and Business, Senator Ita Enang has called on President Goodluck Jonathan to revoke and re-allocate oil blocks, saying that the northerners control 83 percent of the Oil blocks in the country.

It was later discovered that this amount was paid into a British Bank where it yielded about $400 million interest. Nobody knows where that money is. Buhari said he did n't know about it. He was appointed by Abacha as chairman of PTF, my own brother Prof. J.P. Clark was a member. In fact only prof. J.P. Clark and Buhari are still living members of PTF. Buhari brought his brother-in-law as a consultant and later handed over the entire administration of PTF to him and others. They had the authority to execute all projects. At the end of it all, they left and Obasanjo dissolved the board and removed all of them. Then Obasanjo set up a Commission of Enquiry to probe the PTF and the report, which had just been published by some newspapers, shows that N25 billion could not be accounted for by Buhari and those who administered the place.

        "title": "Fixing Nigeria\u2019s \u2018socially useless\u2019 banks",
        "author": "Tabia Princewill",
        "text": "By Tabia Princewill There is no shortage of excitement in Nigeria today. Although the incredible revelations regarding #DasukiGate read like something straight out of a telenovela, one must appreciate that it is necessary to purge the system of corrupt acts and persons in order for this country (and its government) to successfully function. Many of the agencies and parastatals seem to be in a state of chaos, with their heads being successively interrogated for various counts of either fraud or mismanagement. The case of the NIMASA DG and other such agencies which earned revenue in dollars yet allegedly only remitted a lesser Naira equivalent to the Federal Government, proves that without the anti-corruption war, the many loopholes and leakages created and enforced by past administrations, would prevail, thus robbing Nigeria and its citizens of the much-needed funds to develop this country. The EFCC recently communicated that it has been interrogating Sally Mbanefo, DG Nigerian Tourism Development Corporation over the misuse and possible misappropriation of N600 million. If this proves to be true, what is left for the next DG to work with? So, to those saying Buhari has not fulfilled his campaign promises, let us sincerely ask, how can he, without first of all recovering the funds necessary to fulfill said promises? Former national security adviser of ex-president Goodluck Jonathan, Sambo Dasuki (R), speaks with his lawyer Ahmed Raji, during his trial at the federal high court in Abuja, on September 1, 2015. Nigerian prosecutors on September 1, 2015 slapped a charge of unlawful possession of arms against Dasuki. Dasuki was arraigned on a \u201cone-count charge of being in possession of firearms without licence,\u201d Prosecutor Mohammed Diri told the federal high court in Abuja. AFP PHOTO Permanent tax waivers Most Nigerians don\u2019t pay taxes. In fact, according to the country Director of Action Aid, Ms. Ojobo Atuluku, Nigeria lost an estimated $3.3billion in revenue last year because many companies don\u2019t pay taxes. Curiously, the Federal Government under the past administration signed permanent tax waivers with some companies, which therefore make only profits and remit nothing to government. This estimated $3.3 billion (N750 billion) lost is three times Nigeria\u2019s budget for healthcare and education. So, again, how can Buhari fulfill his campaign promises without plugging such holes and leakages, which exist due to corruption? Now, let us come to the immoral, complicit banking system that houses these \u201clost\u201d funds, which rightfully belong to the Federal Government and to the Nigerian citizenry. Let us also compare this to what obtains in other climes. Last year HSBC was fined \u00a328 million for assisting money laundering through \u201corganisational deficiencies\u201d which meant the bank helped a mixture of mafiosos, politicians and businessmen from the developing world (of which some top Nigerians listed in a public report) to make their money appear legitimate. At the end of the trial, Geneva\u2019s chief prosecutor, Olivier Jornot, said to the bank executives: \u201cThis (the so-called organisational deficiencies) is an excuse which will only apply once.\u201d When will Nigerian banks be given such notice? It is not enough for those on trial for corruption to say: \u201cwe didn\u2019t know where the money was from\u201d. The Nigerian financial sector is opaque and awash with criminal funds. Every time a bank launches a meaningless, would-be empowerment scheme which barely benefits a handful of people, and we excitedly celebrate them for handing the people crumbs, I think back to the words of Mark Carney, the English Central Bank Governor who in 2013 cautioned banks against being \u201csocially useless\u201d. Any bank that doesn\u2019t focus on the real economy, on building small businesses by providing loans to entrepreneurs, a bank that only truly deals with the funds of the 1%, can be deemed \u201csocially useless\u201d for not helping businesses to invest their money and create jobs. The millions still operating outside of the banking sector often because their money is regarded as \u201ctoo small\u201d to make a difference, show Nigerian banks are disconnected from real people and their trades which it could build its profit on. Our banks prefer government officials\u2019 quick, easy money. Hence why the Treasury Single Account, TSA, was so vehemently opposed by the banks and the politicians whose dirty money is no longer welcome in most Western countries: even Switzerland is attempting reform! Then there is the issue of foreign exchange transactions and round tripping, aided by bank staff. The illegal diversion of money from the inter-bank market to the parallel market, benefits bureau de change operators; it is this system that enables such allegations as $35 million used to rig an election. Speculative trading To counter \u201csocially useless\u201d banks and to enable government more firmly control and benefit from forex transactions, the Tobin tax (named after Nobel Laureate and economist James Tobin) is used in financial centres confronted with speculative trading and round tripping (e.g. Mumbai, Johannesburg, Hong Kong). This tax on large forex transactions not only raises money for government but can also be used to finance its debt. In Nigeria, given that many banks were rescued by AMCON using public funds, and to top it all, do little to economically empower the public, why shouldn\u2019t they be taxed? The state needs funds to deliver change for the common man: let\u2019s get creative and rescue public funds from those holding it hostage. After all, AMCON MD, Ahmed Kuru says rich Nigerians who owe the corporation money still fly around in private jets rather than repay what they owe! Nigerian banks don\u2019t invest in Nigerians (we believe it is only the bank of industry or micro credit banks\u2019 job to do this) whereas most of our financial institutions operate under commercial banking licences. Rather than focusing on auto loans or mortgages, or encouraging hard working Nigerians to invest or buy shares, we prefer to accumulate non-performing loans awarded to various characters who see shareholders\u2019 money as their personal play thing. In the #DasukiGate saga, it is interesting that none of the banks holding the funds paid to Olisa Metuh or any of the other accused, are being made to explain the role they played. Funds of dubious origin These companies are as of yet just witnesses, but if Buhari\u2019s proposed anti-money laundering bill is passed, banks and asset managers handling the alleged proceeds of corruption will be prosecuted, as is done all over the world because a party has indeed committed an offence if he knows or ought reasonably to have known that the funds are of dubious origin. A certain Nneka Ararume, a former wealth manager with Assets Resource Management, ARM, claimed during the Metuh hearing, that she received $2 million in $100 bills from him, for investments. She was quoted as saying: \u201cWe only have access to the funds when the client transfers money to us or when the client asks us to transfer money to them, we have all clients\u2019 account details on file.\u201d In which case, why didn\u2019t anyone raise the alarm? Thankfully, section 15 of Buhari\u2019s anti-money laundering bill states: \u201cIt is a criminal offence for anyone to make or accept a cash payment beyond a particular amount\u201d and if such a transaction occurs, it must be reported by the institution and/or its employees. Concealment of such an act is criminal. One thing\u2019s for sure, 2016 will be a most interesting year. A rewarding one too, for those who refused to take part in the looting. Obanikoro It is evident that Nigerian politicians do not understand the way a democracy works. If an allegation leveled against you is false, let it be proven to be so, allow the authorities to investigate without insulting them. EFCC isn\u2019t \u201cdeceiving\u201d Nigerians or indulging in \u201csmear tactics\u201d by letting the public know its findings. Nigerians have a right to know what is alleged to have happened to public funds, which government officials hold in trust. The common man\u2019s human rights matter too. Buhari The challenge facing the war against corruption: our corrupt judiciary. What about establishing special courts? Corruption, with these mind-boggling revelations, is a crime against the citizenry. If properly explained to Nigerians there would be wide spread support for special courts to circumvent corrupt judges. I might even be in favour of using international bodies to try these cases, perhaps the UN or the ICC as no one is impartial in Nigeria and the accusations are grave enough. Why not an international criminal tribunal, like in Sierra Leone after the war? Make no mistake, we are indeed at war against those willing to destroy Nigeria. Related",

        "title": "Buhari\u2019s rapidly vanishing mystique",
        "author": "Ochereome Nnanna",
        "text": "By Ochereome Nnanna EVERY administration enjoys its share of honeymoon after assuming power. The allure of newness and expectations are high during this period, and the people are willing to overlook and excuse little blunders here and there. But months down the line, one or two major things happen, and the honeymoon is over. When former President Goodluck Jonathan took over in 2011, his trajectory from Deputy Governor to Governor and from Vice President to President was a major talking point during his honeymoon. His being the first ethnic Minority Nigerian to recieve the overwhelming vote of the electorate, even when ranged against powerful Northern opponents was something people found inspiring. But the moment he attempted to remove the petroleum subsidy starting from January 1, 2012, the romance quickly vanished. Unfortunately, Jonathan backed off from completely removing the subsidy, with the resultant effect that Nigeria went on to spend over two more trillion Naira on fuel subsidies; an amount that could have turned around the massive infrastructure deficit of the country if properly invested. President Muhammadu Buhari came on the crest of what some romantically termed: \u201cChange Revolution\u201d. It was the first time a sitting president seeking a second term was voted out in Nigeria and he left without making any fuss. In Africa, it was the second time it ever happned, following the noble example of former Senegalese President, Abdoulaye Wade, who conceded victory to his former Minister, Macky Sall, on Monday 26th March 2012. Even if the election that brought Buhari in was not that copasetic (what with millions of under-age voters and non-use of the card reader in the Muslim North, his main political base), the transitional process was second to none. This was obviously why many newspapers awarded both the former and incumbent presidents their joint Man-of-the Year 2015. On assumption of power, Buhari\u2019s media magicians, notably Femi Adesina (alias Kulikuli) and Garba Shehu, stoked his mystique with fairytale characterisations: \u201cthe New Sheriff in Town\u201d, who accomplished great feats of change through his \u201cBody Language\u201d, feats which were fondly attributed to \u201cThe Buhari Effect\u201d. You will recall that as soon as Buhari was announced winner of the presidential election, the Naira, which was going for 228 against the US Dollar, appreciated by seven percent to 211. His supporters boasted that if he could achieve this without lifting a finger, then his campaign promise to make the Naira equal to the Dollar would be accomplished before long. But today, the story is different. At the last check, the Naira exchanged for the Dollar at 313: 1, with many proffering the bleak prognosis that we might be headed eventually for 500:1 or an outright devaluation (which Buhari\u2019s Western backers have asked him to do). In June 2015 the comatose refineries suddenly restarted refining petroleum products without the regime spending a kobo. Today, Kaduna and Port Harcourt refineris remain shut and will not resume production till end of this month. While \u201cthe Buhari Effect\u201d held sway, there was a noticeable improvement in power supply, even when the new leader had not made a policy pronouncement on which way his cat was going to jump. Some even claimed they now had between 18 to 24 hours of power supply a day. They forgot that this was the cool and rainy season when, traditionally, the hydrothermal plants were full with water which results to more available megawatts for the national grid. What do we have now? The power supply has nosedived, though the administration has reported that we have crossed the 5,000 megawatts threshold \u201cfor the first time\u201d. The Power Distribution Companies (DISCOs) which bought over the assets of erstwhile state monopoly, Power Holding Company of Nigeria (PHCN), on February 1, 2016, made good their threat to raise electricity tariff by 46 percent. Nigeria\u2019s Organised Labour, which had been in hibernation since Comrade Adams Oshiomhole stepped down as Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC) President, also made good their threat to picket their offices nationwide. That is the most poignant sure sign that the honeymoon is over. This honeymoon usually stops when concrete governance starts. However, the power tariff hike is a small thing compared to the great damage to the Buhari administration\u2019s image which the 2016 budget saga is beginning to turn up. The insanity of the 2016 budget is twofold. On the one hand is the massive amount of corruption (paddings, duplications) which are being unearthed at the House of Representatives and the Senate. The second is Federal Government\u2019s inability to discover these crooked intents to steal our public funds right under the nose of an anti-corruption president, which reeks of gross incompetence from the Budget Office and the Federal Ministry of Finance to the Presidency. Not only that, an aide of the President, Senator Etta Enang, has been accused of being behind the tampering with the budget which President Buhari presented before the National Assembly. The confusion and corruption surrounding the budget is so much that one of the Ministers, Prof. Isaac Adewole, who is in charge of the Health Ministry, openly disowned his ministry\u2019s budget when he was supposed to defend it before the Legislature. He said \u201crats\u201d (which are also known as \u201cbudget mafia\u201d) had doctored it. Frustrated, the Chairmen of the Appropriation Committees of the House and Senate, announced that the February 25 date for the passage of the budget had been postponed indefinitely. The President has promised to punish the civil servants who were responsible for sabotaging the budget and using it to paint his administration in corrupt colours. We wait to see.Buhari\u2019s Budgetgate exposes an irony. Remember, during the four-month delay in naming his cabinet, Buhari betrayed his confidence on bureaucrats and disdain for ministers. He told France 24, a television station and I quote: \u201cNo. It is what we know \u2013 and which we learned from the Western system. The civil service provides the continuity, the technocrat. And in any case, they are those that do most of the work. The ministers are there, I think, to make a lot of noise\u2026. But the work is being done by the technocrats. They are there; they have to provide continuity, dig into the records and then guide us who are just coming in\u201d. Buhari was heavily criticised (I lent my voice to it here) for making it seem like ministers are unimportant. Is it not an irony that the same civil servants on whom Buhari depends for \u201cguidance\u201d are now the ones corrupting his first budget with a view to stealing public funds? Buhari\u2019s trusted civil servants who orchestrated the disgrace of former Health Minister, Professor Adenike Grange (she has since cleared her name in court) are the ones who want to scam us once again through this Budgetgate. Nine months into his regime, our President, who is permanently on foreign tours, no longer possesses the body language to deter civil trusted servants from attempting to loot the treasury. They are no longer deterred by the exploits of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) which is grabbing people, detaining them, arraigning them and sealing up their properties. In fact, it has come to a point where Buhari will criticise the Judiciary and the Chief Justice of Nigeria and the Nigerian Bar Association will answer back. Boko Haram, which had been \u2018\u201ctechnically defeated\u201d resumes invasions of communities and a rash of suicide bombings. It has become obvious, even to Buhari\u2019s ardent supporters that governance is not a fairytale; it is not a daydream. You must do the work and do it well. In this our democracy, whatever you sow, you will reap. Related",

The truth of the matter is that PMB need to quickly address some critical issues now and put in place means of ensuring more vigilance and decisiveness in dealing with upcoming issues and events that could tarnish his efforts and the image of his government. He is the President and CIC and the buck stops at his desk. He needs to trust those working with him like he did the Civil Servants but when they fail him, like most of them are likely to do because they want to maintain the statusquo, I believe heads should roll; and infact heads should start rolling by now. We cannot continue to blame past government or the PDP. This government and APC is in-charge now and we need to see what differentiates it from the past or the clear positive change they promised Nigerians. If APC accepts the former PDP chieftains into its fold to remove the PDP from power, it should be able to manage them well enough to enable it deliver the change it promised Nigerians. Otherwise, it will be doing a dis-serivce to the nation and Nigerians. The President has power to hire and fire officers who work with him. He is obliged to employ the appropriate procedures to remove any Civil Servant that becomes a clog in its wheels of progress.</p><p>As for the Naira-Dollar rate, I don't believe devaluation is the answer. Devaluation of the Naira will only be useful to Nigeria if it has many products it export to earn foreign exchange. Our key commodity, the crude oil, is priced in US Dollars and not in Naira, so devaluing the currency will not make the product sell more to the benefit of Nigeria and her Naira. The Government and its economic team, if it has any, need to take measures that will block the leakages where the foreign reserves are drained, for example, importation of frivolous goods like food items that can be produced locally, tooth picks, plastic products, various China toyish household goods that we find on our streets including furniture. Others are vehicles...lets patronize the locally assembled ones and school fees...lets strengthen our educational institutions and infrastructures, medical tourism...lets reform our medical system, etc. These are the drain pipes on our foreign reserves that is killing the Naira.</p><p>May God guide this regime and bless Nigeria.</p>",

        "title": "Judges: Working from the answer to the question",
        "author": "Josef Omorotionwan",
        "text": "By Josef Omorotionwan PRESIDENT Muhammadu Buhari easily provides a good example of a living realist who sees, and appreciates, things as they really are, devoid of all unnecessary niceties. While addressing the Nigerian community in far-away Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, Buhari came out loud and clear, \u201cIn the fight against corruption, the Judiciary is my greatest problem\u201d. Is Buhari alone? Certainly not. We agree with the President that except he gets the Judiciary to buy into his vision in the fight against corruption, not much will be achieved. This is where the Judiciary has attempted to constitute itself into a clog in the wheel of progress. Again, besides the battle-front of the corruption fight, the Judiciary, as symbolised by the apex court, the Supreme Court of Nigeria, has exposed itself to public opprobrium in many respects: For example, lately, we have observed a sharp dichotomy between the Court of Justice and the Court of Law: On electoral matters, while the lower courts \u2013 the Election Petitions Tribunals and the Court of Appeal have stood on the side of justice where they saw no alternative to re-run elections in areas where elections were bedeviled with widespread violence and massive irregularities and in most cases elections did not hold at all, like Rivers and Akwa-Ibom States, yet miracle results emerged. On the other hand, the Supreme Court has remained on the side of the Court of Law and technicalities where strict constructionism holds sway. And nothing else counts. Every aspect of the contraptions in the 2015 elections in Rivers and Akwa-Ibom States manifests signs that can easily consume everyone \u2013 a situation in which people are openly encouraged to win elections by all means and at all costs; and then proceed to the Courts to validate it portend real danger. We wonder how anyone could be allowed to become a winner of such bedeviled contests as happened in Rivers and Akwa-Ibom States where, largely, elections did not hold at all and results were written, no thanks to the so-called power of incumbency. Someone must tell the Supreme Court Justices that they have just given a stamp of approval to violent elections and election robberies. We are back to the murky waters of dirty politics; and the world is watching us. The tree of liberty must be watered by the blood of tyrants. Sadly, there is an added dimension to our adjudication process. We call that the hanging judgment. Apparently, with monotonous regularity, the Supreme Court gives judgment before going into the books in search of the reasons that fit the judgment. This is working from the answer to the question. At last, the Supreme Court Justices have obliged us with the deferred reasoning for their decision in the Rivers State gubernatorial contest. We search, but in vain, for any spectacular reason that clearly justifies the waiting, apart from putting a death knell on the Card Readers. Is that what we must wait for 16 long days to hear? And this was a case that they had three months to deal with, a reasonable part of which they could as well have devoted to writing the decision. We have seen how the deferred reasoning works elsewhere. In Year 2000 presidential contest between Al Gore and George W. Bush in the US, the difference in their scores was razor-thin. Inauguration clock was ticking off and there was a quick legal question that needed to be determined as to who should be inaugurated. The Supreme Court sat all night and untied the tight knot. In such an emergency, there was good reason to ask people to wait for a few days to hear the full details and reasoning behind the Supreme Court decision. Definitely, this cannot apply in cases where someone was sleeping on duty and asking the world to watch him snore. Which system of justice anywhere in the world would totally ignore the feelings and temperament of the people in its adjudication process as the Supreme Court of Nigeria would want us to believe? Is it not becoming clearer that former President Goodluck Jonathan really saved this country from catastrophe? We can now see why the Judiciary may never forgive him for choosing the path of honour by bowing out honourably. If nothing else, there is loss of income to some people somewhere. Some expected him to reject the outcome of the last election. They were already laying wait for him at the entrance of the Supreme Court, where a favourable decision awaited him. And since the feelings of the people do not come into reckoning, it would also not have mattered an inch if by now, the entire country was aflame. This represents a frightening glimpse of the dangerous path the Supreme Court is shaping for this country. There is no better time than now to begin to listen to those who feel that our judges must stand to be judged. The time to subject our Judiciary to total investigation and overhaul is now. The Judiciary cannot be exempted from the current crusade against corruption. In fact, it should be at the very centre. Recently, a judge whose allegation of massive corruption and misconduct was about to be determined by the National Judicial Council, NJC, quickly threw in his retirement papers and went back home to become a first class traditional ruler. Recent action of the Supreme Court is one impunity taken too far. For how long shall the entire country be taken for this jolly ride? We, however, take solace in Justice Chukwudifu Akunne Oputa (1918-2014), a former Justice of the Supreme Court and one of the most eminent jurists the world has ever known: \u201cWe are final not because we are infallible; rather we are infallible because we are final\u201d. Yes, the powers in the hands of judges are great but they must be exercised with caution. After all, the stones are still on the ground. In extreme provocation, people throw them at people! Sadly, we are getting there. Related",

        "text": "By Obi Nwakanma Last week, Vanguard reported a curious drama during the State House briefing after the meeting of the National Executive Council, between State House Correspondents and the Minister for Information, Mr. Lai Mohammed. It seemed like the Buhari cabinet did not have much to talk about. There is of course much going on. Boko Haram is still killing and pillaging. The Chibok girls are as good as lost. To remove the sheen from that fact, the President was reported a while ago to have pointedly told parents of the girls of Chibok to go home as there\u2019s not much else he could do for them. Former President Goodluck Jonathan Well, that\u2019s very disappointing because President Buhari and the APC made it a cardinal point of their election promise to return the kidnapped girls of Chibok to their families as soon as they are installed in government. Not to return the girls will amount to a breach of trust and a failure to fulfil a cardinal electoral promise. Goodluck Jonathan lost Nigerians, and began to lose his re-election following the massive international outrage that accompanied the kidnap of the Chibok girls. The Jonathan administration was vehemently criticized for its slow and half-hearted response, and for its inability to mount a strategic rescue operation to get back the girls from their captor. The loss of the Chibok girls was Jonathan\u2019s greatest undoing, and it is actually in my thinking right after all, that for that alone, he deserved to lose the presidency. Right under his watch over two hundred young women disappeared from a boarding school. This was more than a security lapse, it was a clear failure of national security. It required a great operational capability to move that number of people through many borders, and it needed only a decayed or frayed security system to permit that. Because the president failed to protect these citizens of Nigeria to whom he had sworn both allegiance and service, he did not deserve to be returned to his job as president. In actual fact, Jonathan\u2019s slow response, and the campaign mounted in protest grew to frenzy. In the end, he went to the National Assembly and secured $1 billion in supplementary funding for his national security operations to fight Boko Haram, and mandated that operation on his National Security Adviser, Sambo Dasuki. If truth must be told, by the time of the elections, Jonathan\u2019s new strategy had put Boko Haram on the run, degraded its operations, and the tide had turned very clearly. Another three to six months of sustained action at the level may have seen the end of Boko Haram by now. But it was already too late for Jonathan\u2019s government. He had waited far too late in the day to mount a serious counter offensive against the Islamic insurgency. It was too little too late. But there were visible signs of an impending Boko Haram defeat at the eve of Jonathan\u2019s departure, on the strength of which Mr. Lai Mohammed, the Minister for Information, and Chief spokesman of this administration, no sooner in the life of the current administration was almost too quick on the draw to claim victory and the defeat of Boko Haram. Lai Mohammed was quoted at various times to say that Boko Haram, \u201ctechnically\u201d had been defeated and \u201cdegraded.\u201d But six months later, Boko Haram is still there, and under the watch of this administration, has mounted even bolder, more ferocious attack, and on a greater killing spree than was possible under Jonathan. The Buhari administration has thus far failed in its promise to defeat Boko Haram. The significant push-back achieved at the twilight of the Jonathan administration has been lost. There is no clear-cut policy on the insurgency by this president except to move his military headquarters and put more boots on the ground. But an insurgency such as this requires a different strategy of counter-insurgency beyond traditional warfare techniques, and Jonathan\u2019s last strategy before his electoral defeat had come to understand this. Meanwhile, the Buhari administration is busy conducting a killing spree of unarmed Biafran protesters in the South East of Nigeria, while Boko Haram insurgents are running wild in the North East. Something clearly doesn\u2019t add up here, but back to Lai Mohammed. His critics have dubbed him \u201cLiar Mohammed,\u201d an unkind cut from his name, \u201cLai.\u201d I have always liked the name, \u201cLai\u201d because a great friend of mine from the University was called \u201cLai\u201d and he was a great guy. Besides, I will not go so far as calling a Nigerian minister, \u201cLiar,\u201d but it often takes a great alchemist of untruths and distortions, to do the work of pure propaganda, as Mr. Mohammed has often done for the current administration. His strategy when everything fails is, \u201cblame Jonathan.\u201d So, in this last briefing of journalists, only two items were lined up: his attempt to explain the president\u2019s numerous foreign travels, which has recently come under severe criticism, and his need to blame Jonathan for everything else. Reporters wanted to know a bit more \u2013 the radical slide of the naira, Boko Haram, the budget-padding scandal, the administration\u2019s economic projections. But Lai Mohammed was in his element. Blame Jonathan. To justify the president\u2019s increasingly expensive and wasteful foreign trips, the minister said, \u201cYou cannot run an economy by being isolated.\u201d True enough. But that is why we have a Foreign Ministry and a foreign minister. Trained diplomats would not tell the Telegraph in London as the President recently did that \u201cNigerians are mostly criminals.\u201d Such a statement is not meant to inspire or invite investor confidence. But what did Lai say? Blame Jonathan. Buhari has to travel because Nigeria had a pariah status under Jonathan. That is a lie, minister. Nigeria\u2019s international standing actually improved under Jonathan. But this blame Jonathan game is getting old and worrisome. Budget goes missing, blame Jonathan. Buhari travels, blame Jonathan; Boko Haram continues to strike, blame Jonathan; Naira crashes, blame Jonathan; Economy worsens, blame Jonathan. One truth is clear: Jonathan revived the comatose railways, rebuilt long run-down federal highways, re-equipped the Armed Services, built twelve new Universities, and expanded the middle class. Above all, his greatest achievement was that Nigerians felt true liberty and freedom: no Nigerian lived in fear of government\u2019s persecution, and he brought to an end, the spate of assassinations and kidnappings that marked the height of national insecurity before him. He wasn\u2019t without achievement. His greatest undoing was the kidnap of the Chibok girls and his slow response to it. Lai Mohammed\u2019s attempt to place the current failures of the current administration on Jonathan is both laughable and tragic. What is increasingly clear is that the APC had no plan to govern. Buhari\u2019s first steps in government was all wrong: he started by alienating an entire segment of Nigerians, and he was too slow to respond to the realities of the crisis in the international oil market. Rather than pick up from Jonathan running, he crawled for six months, and seemed startled and confused by his own electoral victory. That period of inaction for six months when he failed to organize his government, stanch leakages, and establish necessary reforms has led to the current crisis with the Naira in a freefall, and the economy leaking badly like a wicker basket. Buhari\u2019s economic policy that limited the circulation of money has led to a crisis of production and distribution. When he finally presented his budget, it became clear to Nigerians that this president is the one who really has no clue what running a contemporary nation is about in the 21st century, and the Tsunami that is about to hit him if he fails to reposition his priorities. He is already nine months in office, and he is still blaming Jonathan. Come three years hence this government will still be blaming Jonathan. Blame Jonathan is, it seems, the Buhari administration\u2019s most consistent domestic policy. O ma bloody se o! Related",

One thing is sure, and that is that, true history cannot never be perverted or suppressed. Jonathan, is not a demon, he loved Nigeria and did his best as a man.Jonathan achieved several things for Nigeria as highlighted by the writer. Rubbishing and hatred for anything Jonathan would never be an achievement for Buhari and his cohorts. Until this government recognise that governance is a continuum, Buhari would not be able to make any meaningful change to better the life of Nigerians.</p>",

It was a message garbed with uncaccustomed subtlety from Soyinka, who is usually finger-in-your-eye with words when addressing what he perceives as lapses in a regime he does not fancy. Buhari and Soyinka Yes, indeed, the President Muhammadu Buhari All Progressives Congress (APC) Federal Government is full of Soyinka\u2019s friends, including a former governor of an oil-rich state whose traducer successor alleged he spent N80 million on the respected professor\u2019s 80th birthday bash (which the former governor pooh-poohed). We all vividly still remember that Prof Soyinka cheered the then opposition APC federal lawmakers on in 2014 when they climbed the gates of the National Assembly in Abuja to nip the possible impeachment of Speaker Waziri Tambuwal after being locked out by the security agencies. He often engaged former President Goodluck Jonathan, his wife, Dame Patience, and spokesmen of the then ruling Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) Federal Government in open, \u201ckill-and-bury\u201d verbal exchanges. This, indeed, is the very first time in the history of this country that Prof. Soyinka is portraying the sheerest of bonhomie towards a sitting Federal Government. He went to prison for upbraiding the General Yakubu Gowon regime for the atrocities against the ordinary people in the breakaway Republic of Biafra during the civil war. He went on exile as part of the National Democratic Coalition (NADECO\u2019s) struggle against the regime of General Sani Abacha, and for the revalidation of the annulled June 12 presidential election of 1993 won by Chief Moshood Abiola. He publicly sparred with General Olusegun Obasanjo in the two periods that Obasanjo, his kinsman from the same Abeokuta, occupied the presidential office. Therefore, this new and strange bedfellowship between Soyinka and a government in power is totally out of kilter with his tradition. Obviously, the Buhari presidential dispensation is Soyinka\u2019s dream government. Surely, if the situation were different, rather than this unnerving diplomatese, Soyinka would have poured vitriol. The way I see it, this call for a conference to help Buhari find the antidote for the economic situation after nine months in power simply means he thinks the President has no answers of his own. In fact, people have gone so far as to use the word: \u201cclueless\u201d to describe Buhari\u2019s lack of economic direction. The Economist of London had termed former President Jonathan an \u201cineffectual buffoon\u201d. The Nigerian writer widely accused of being the brain behind that barefaced insult has just been appointed as Buhari\u2019s fourth media aide. Now, the shoe is on the other foot. Nine months of rudderless economic floating, the Financial Times of the same London summarised \u201cBuharinomics\u201d as \u201cthe height of foolishness\u201d arguing that its plan to raise $25 billion dollars from private and public sources to avoid the looming recession might actually plunge Nigeria into a Venezuela-like economic crisis. Now, what would the paper say about the oddities in Buhari\u2019s first budget to the National Assembly, which contains so many hilarious items, the most prepostrous of which was the over N22 million set aside for \u201crent for Aso Villa\u201d! Former military President, General Ibrahim Babangida built Aso Villa. Is he the \u201clandlord\u201d collecting the \u201crent\u201d for Aso Villa, our own White House? I am waiting to hear what The Economist of London, which had openly endorsed the Buhari candidacy, will say after Professor Soyinka\u2019s subtle friendly fire. Even Professor Pat Utomi, who had been an ardent admirer of the President when he assumed power, has now gone red in the face at the total lack of space for economists in the Buhari presidency. It is now a trite observation to say that Buhari and his party were not ready for governance. They still are not, even now. While the President is slurping the splendours of the Presidency junketing from coast to coast, pole to pole, his party men and women are scrambling for posts being vacated by Jonathan\u2019s employees. Buhari\u2019s idea of running the country has obviously not changed from the template of 32 years ago when he first came: fight corruption and send looters to jail. Unfortunately, he no longer has the benefit of a Deputy he trusts enough to effectively govern while he flies around. In 1984, he had Brigadier Tunde Idiagbon, whom he allowed to run the successful War Against Indiscipline (WAI). That appeared to be the only real achievement of that regime in its 20 months lifespan. For some reasons known to Buhari, Vice President Yemi Osinbajo has not been made the Tunde Idiagbon of our time. We sometimes don\u2019t even remember he is there. Unfortunately, the man who might have anchored the Buhari Presidency for him (Mallam Nasir El Rufai) is the Governor of Kaduna State, with his hands full after being threatened with witchcraft by beggars he intended to remove from the streets. Instead, the President has created some super-ministers and given them huge sums of money to go and do their own magic. Mallam Adamu Adamu, who is running the Education Ministry with the N370 billion allocation in the controversial budget, is using APC\u2019s broom to sweep away Vice-chancellors of universities built by Jonathan and loading them with (mainly) people from his section of the country. Babatunde Fashola, the blue-eyed Lagos wonderboy is given N433.4 billion to work miracles in the Power, Works and Hosuing sectors, while Rotimi Amaechi, the President\u2019s Port Harcourt discovery, is given N216 billion to turnaround the Transportation sector. When will the budget be ready for the spending spree to start? I don\u2019t agree with Prof. Soyinka that we need an emergency conference. There is nothing about the economic challenge we are facing which a visionary regime cannot tackle if they want to. Buhari should stop chasing shadows abroad and sit down to fix the economy as he promised at the campaigns. We are watching. Related",

I am also not of the opinion that you are an ethnic bigot.

Regular readers of your column will remember that you were all out for Goodluck Jonathan during the campaigns. Since your hero was defeated at the polls - and this for you is obviously very painful - you have never missed any opportunity to excoriate Buhari. Your present outing is only one in a long list of such insincere contributions. But for your antecedents (on Buhari) anyone who read this piece would come away with a positive judgement. But you see, such antecedents plant in the mind of readers other criteria to judge the writer. I am not an oracle on this but this is the way I see it.</p>",

        "title": "Niger Delta people, flow into a common river",
        "author": "Owei Lakemfa",
        "text": "By Owei Lakemfa THE people of the Niger Delta are \u201cone people from the same tree.\u201d This is a basic fact, but it assumes far greater significance when this open secret is revealed by HRH Omoba Godfrey Ikenwoli Emiko, the Olu of Warri, leader and symbol of the Itsekiri Nation. His actions since his coronation on December 12, 2015 and interview in the Saturday February 20, 2016 Vanguard Newspaper maybe an indication that the restive Niger Delta has a mighty force of peace sweeping through it. One of the major statements he made in the interview is that \u201cBeing in conflict with the Ijaws is the most unfortunate thing to have happened to the Itsekiris, because they are supposed to be our closest neigbours, with whom we have inter-married the most.\u201d During those tragic conflicts in the 1990s, I was a sort of special correspondent for Vanguard on the Niger Delta and was assigned to do some reports which required my interviewing leaders from both sides. I was given the address of a house in Lagos where leaders of Itsekiri youths met regularly to strategise on the conflict and plan new moves. When I announced my presence, the inhabitants seemed stunned. They knew me, and one of them blurted \u201cYou are Ijaw\u201d. I answered in the affirmative. Another asked in surprise why I was not afraid to come to the house, I answered that we are basically brothers, besides, the person who sent me, Mr. Sam Amuka, Publisher of the Vanguard, is an Itsekiri elder and one of the best known Itsekiris. He knew I was Ijaw before assigning me, but he knows I will do a professional job. The Olu told a personal family story \u201cMy father of blessed memory, Erejuwa II, his mother is from Escravos. The five prominent Itsekiri royal families today, their mother is Ijaw.\u201d This is quite familiar. During the conflict, I had often wondered how both sides could differentiate themselves; it was not unlikely that blood relations attacked themselves. I recall the Urhobo-Itsekiri conflict. Again, I was confident that blood relations were attacking themselves. At that time, I had a journalist colleague in Lagos who seemed lost in thought. I asked her what the problem was, she shook her head and smiled ruefully, \u201cIts my parents, old people; my mother asked my father \u2018why are your people killing my people?\u201d The mother is Itsekiri, the father, Urhobo. That was the dilemma many from the Niger Delta had during those crazy conflicts which were partly elite fight over crumbs from oil companies. I had often wondered what I would do if Ijaws and Isokos were to have such a conflict; my paternal and maternal grandmothers were Isokos, and both Ijaw and Isoko were spoken in my home. In my part of Ijawland, it is difficult to find a family without Isoko connections, and the language is used as one of commerce. My father told me a story that happened in the 1920s about a dispute over land with some Isokos in the creeks. The youths mobilised to go and retake their lands. He said at a point, he got up and said while it was painful that part of their ancestral land was being occupied by Isokos, he cannot shed the blood of his mother\u2019s people. His brother got up to support him, more youths took his side, and the attack had to be abandoned. I agree with the Olu\u2019s analysis that most of the problems Ijaws and Itsekiris have are \u201cmore political because an Ijaw man, who knows how the relationship was built over the years, would not attack an itsekiri man on whatever ground.\u201d The Olu\u2019s recall of two other incidents were quite touching. The first was that when Itsekiris were excluded from the National Conference convened by the Jonathan administration, \u201cChief Tunde Smooth, an Ijaw, was the first person that wrote in the papers that it was wrong for an Itsekiri man not to be there.\u201d Subsequently, Chief Issac Jemide was invited to the conference. The lesson he says is that \u201c The Ijaw man should fight for an Itsekiri man and an Itsekiri man should do likewise. The same thing should apply to an Urhobo man, and this would in turn make us a strong body defending each other.\u201d This brings me to his next illustration. The Olu\u2019s father, His Majesty Erejuwa II was dethroned as the Olu in 1964. But when Major General David Ejoor (Rtd) an Urhobo, became the new Governor of the then Mid-West Region, he reinstated him. The Olu recalls \u201cAn Urhobo man brought my father from there (exile in Ogbese, behind Okada) saying \u2018go away, go back to your throne\u2019 and that was it. I will never forget that experience.\u201d The Niger Delta people are tributaries flowing into a common river; the waters cannot be differentiated, and if any of the tributaries is contaminated, the whole river is polluted. The Olu\u2019s recipe for development in the area is simple; engage the people in gainful employment, provide basic infrastructure such as a link bridge from Ogbe-Ijoh to Ode-Itsekiri and resuscitate Warri Port. On the national level, he suggests grazing sites for Fulani herdsmen to eliminate the recurrent bloody farmers-herdsmen conflicts The Olu who is reaching out to traditional rulers in the Ijaw and Urhobo kingdoms needs to be encouraged and supported in his chosen path. There are those who profit from conflict, such people who can be found in all nationalities in the region including the Itsekiri, will not want him to succeed. Related",

        "title": "Islam\u2019s global image problem",
        "author": "Donu Kogbara",
        "text": "By Donu Kogbara The Sultan of Sokoto, Alhaji Saad Abubakar III, recently expressed regret about the fact that Muslim extremists make Islam look bad and have turned it into \u201ca bashing boy\u2026because people hold it responsible for the misdeeds of a few.\u201d His Eminence, the Sultan, who is the spiritual leader of Nigerian Muslims and the President, Supreme Council for Islamic Affairs, then urged his faithful followers to be peaceful and to work hard to improve their religion\u2019s ailing reputation. I really feel for the Sultan and for all decent Muslims who abhor the terrible crimes against humanity that are being committed, not just in Nigeria but worldwide, by psychopathic outlaws who claim to be super-devout Islamic warriors. The activities of these marauding murderers is costing Muslims so much goodwill in many nations that have been subjected to suicide bombings and other acts of savagery. And many non-Muslims now view ALL Muslims with intense suspicion or burning hatred and regard Islam and its adherents as intrinsically evil. Muslim population The sad irony is that when outrages like the Brussels bombings of March 22 take place, Muslims \u2013 women and children included \u2013 also get caught up in the carnage. The Sultan and other principled Muslim dignitaries frequently point out that it is only a \u201cfew\u201d individuals who are creating mayhem. And they are right in the sense that the number of active Muslim terrorists \u2013 or terrorist-sympathisers \u2013 is far exceeded by the number of Muslims who are not remotely interested in terrorism. However, the \u201cfew\u201d are still a significant percentage of the overall Muslim population. And I would like to understand why so many Muslims are so full of blinding rage and so determined to destroy their own societies and The West. I can see why impoverished and neglected Nigerian Muslim youths in the North-East might become emotionally brutalized and regard Boko Haram as an option. But I don\u2019t see why so many Muslim youths are embracing extremism in essentially liberal countries in which everyone can count on basic necessities and thrive. In the UK, for example, hundreds of Muslim youngsters (whose parents emigrated from Pakistan, Somalia, etc) have benefitted enormously from the best that Britain has to offer \u2013 the welfare state, free education, free healthcare and so on. And yet, they (girls as well as boys) have bitterly turned their backs on their adopted country and abandoned their studies. Several are highly intelligent and could easily have become doctors, lawyers or whatever; but they have chosen to take off to Syria, Iraq and other war zones, to risk their lives by fighting for ISIS. Why? My sister works for a local government area in London that has a lot of ethnic minority inhabitants; and she regularly interacts with non-White youngsters and tells me that many feel alienated and discriminated against by the White majority. I grew up in the UK and have not personally experienced much racism. But my father was a VIP and I went to elite British schools; and I\u2019m humbly willing to accept that rampant racism is a reality for less privileged non-White UK residents. However, non-White Christian kids from ordinary backgrounds face the same challenges as non-White Muslims from ordinary backgrounds in the UK. So why are the former much less prone to joining terrorist organisations than the latter? THIS is the question that Muslim leaders need to address. Christianity has a bloodthirsty past \u2013 history books provide us with gory details about the Inquisition, the Crusades, the anti-Jewish pogroms and so on. And the Christians of today are not saints either! There are violent Christian militants in the Niger Delta and homicidal Christian militias in the Central African Republic and nasty Christians wreaking havoc in numerous other locations. But Islamic terrorism is particularly widespread and particularly effective and particularly lethal and particularly worrying; and I don\u2019t have a clue how this global menace can be eradicated. I\u2019m not even sure that it can ever be eradicated. But it\u2019s cheering to hear influential Muslims like the Sultan admitting that a serious problem exists. One can only pray that solutions can be found. Related",

The treatment of the infidels in Islam is divided into two categories. The polytheists, pagans, idolaters and heathens have the choice of converting to Islam or suffer death. The Jews and Christians, whom the Koran calls people of the book, can retain their religion but on the sufferance of accepting humiliation and subjugation to Islam and payment of Jizyah (poll-tax) to the Islamic rulers.</p><p>Now, let us have a closer look at what the Koran says about the infidels:</p><p>Slay the unbelievers wherever you find them (2:191)</p><p>Make war on the infidels living in your neighboorhood (9:123)</p><p>When opportunity arises, kill the infidels wherever you catch them (9:5)</p><p>Kill the Jews and the Christians if they do not convert to Islam or refuse to pay Jizya tax (9:29)</p><p>Any religion other than Islam is not acceptable (3:85)</p><p>The Qur\u2019an certainly proclaims that when the time is appropriate, Muslims must use force to convert the unbelievers to Islam. For the non-Muslims, the alternative to this is to pay the humiliating protection money (Jizya tax) or be killed (by beheading, of course). A militarily dominant Islam, without doubt, precludes the peaceful co-existence with the unbelievers if the Muslims have to abide strictly by the unalterable stipulations of the Qur\u2019an.</p><p>This is why we see very few \u201cmoderate\u201d muslims coming out and speaking against the violence.

It is recorded that some of these actions have the express permission of God. My understanding is that we are saved by the New Testament.We would have been beasts like these Muslims. The Koran is without a New Testament (a gift of a new life) that is why Muslims are a menace to others and themselves.

I did not tell you in my comment that we are not saved by grace but that a biblical Christian who has the living and loving relationship with Christ cannot be all those people Donu described as Christian terrorists in her article.</p><p>I would like to correct your error of equating the senseless and needless violence of Islam via Muslim jihad to the judgement of God on wicked people and culture in Old Testament. Both of them may be violent but they are not the same.<br>For example, God commanded the destruction of the Canaanites as a judgement on a people that had been exceendingly overdue of God\u2019s judgment for over 400 years. They were given a long time to repent but they did not which was why God used the Israelites as an instrument of judgment on on them and their wicked culture. <br>The Canaanites heard the news of God\u2019s mighty power  which should have brought them to repentance. The biblical Rahab and her family is an evidence that the Canaanites could have avoided their destruction if they had repented before Israel\u2019s God . They did not have to die. Because Ezekiel 33:11 tells us that God\u2019s desire is that the wicked turn from their sin rather than perish . <br>The truth must also be told that God  did not approve of all of the wars recorded in the Old Testament, and that all of the wars that were specifically commissioned by God beyond the time of Joshua were defensive in nature.</p><p>I would like to ask you some questions to clarify the differences between violence in Islam and violence in the Old Testament:<br>1.  Was the violence in the Old Testament a means of spreading Jewish faith? It is no where written in the Old Testament that violence was used to promote Jewish faith.</p><p>2. Did the violence in the Old Testament command martyrdom or did it reward anyone with seventy-two virgins for killing the innocents for the cause of God?</p><p>3. Did the violence in the Old Testament command the killings of infidels or was it only a means by which God judged the wicked?</p>",

        "title": "Should Kachikwu be made to resign?",
        "author": "Muyiwa Adetiba",
        "text": "By Muyiwa Adetiba A petrol station is not the place to spend Easter. But that was what happened to millions of Nigerians last week. For many, the entire Easter weekend was devoted to the search of the elusive liquid gold. So it was at Christmas. So it was at New Year. It is beginning to look like the leadership is determined to deny the rest of us the simple pleasures of the festive seasons having taken most other pleasures and conveniences from us. In the midst of all this, the man whose duty it is to ensure we have sufficient fuel for our needs said most undiplomatically that he was not a magician and that our woes would continue a while longer. We had adequate fuel most of last year and the year before. Were his predecessors practicing sorcery or magic? Dr. Emmanuel Ibe Kachikwu, GMD, NNPC But it could very well mean that the man is facing problems from his constituency unknown to the rest of us. It could mean he is being actively sabotaged by the very people who should be helping out. It could mean the powerful oil and gas barons are putting cogs in the wheel of progress. It could mean the enemies within are the government and party officials who expect the largess of being at the centre and feel short changed. Whatever the cause, Kachikwu\u2019s frustrations and exasperations came out in that statement. It also exposed him to the wolves who would be only too glad to devour him. Asiwaju Bola Tinubu led the pack with his scathing statement. I don\u2019t know whether it was written in his personal capacity or as the leader of the party though the contents suggest the latter. Many people question the medium. Yes, there are indeed many ways Tinubu could have made his feelings known privately including sending for the Minister. But I have no quarrel with the medium if it is not the first time because sometimes you have to make things public for effect and an erring relative could be better corrected if scolded in public. I however believe that the first reprimand should always be made in private. Another positive thing about the letter is that it tried to protect the party by letting us know that it is not insensitive to the plight of the people while assuaging the feelings of the populace. However, a public comment exposes you almost as much as it exposes the person you are writing to in that public analysts are likely to dissect both the content and the intent of the comment. They are going to wonder if there are under lying currents behind the public display. Already, there are insinuations that someone from Lagos State was appointed by Kachikwu without the approval of Tinubu. Or that OANDO which is mainly owned and run by a Tinubu is being gradually squeezed out. Or that the main target is to attack the employer of Kachikwu. While these may or may not be the reasons, it is almost certain that Kachikwu had at some point, stepped on the powerful toes of Tinubu who has now seized the moment like all astute people do. I believe Kachikwu should learn one or two things from the letter. His public comments and body language sometimes make him seem aloof which is strange because he is ordinarily a good communicator. He should also learn to be patient when dealing with the press and the public. While I do not really question the medium and the message in the public letter, I question the tone of it. It is almost as out of line as the Minister\u2019s comment that drew the ire. It is not only dripping with ill-will, it is condescending and lacking in respect. Dr Ibe Kachikwu is, until he is removed, the Honourable Minister of the Federal Republic and deserves some respect especially in public. Berating him like a school boy is not right. Or to use the words of the writer, out of line. Asiwaju Tinubu barely stopped short of asking for his removal. He did allude to it though when he said \u2018he would have been reprimanded or worse\u2019 if he was in the private sector. This was probably the impetus needed by the chorus boys to step forward and ask for Kachikwu\u2019s resignation. A call that led to an unnecessary division in the party structure. I do not wish to dabble into the internal politics of the APC party except to say that should Kachikwu be made to resign on account of incompetence as it is being implied, then over seventy per cent of those in the cabinet should go. He is by far, the most active of the Ministers. He has since assuming office tried to grapple with the hydra-headed monster that is NNPC. He has pushed once again, the PIB into the front burner. If a newspaper named him the best Minister in December, it was probably because many of the others have been anonymous. So if he should be asked to go on the grounds of incompetence, what reasons should be used to keep the others? Most people celebrated Easter in darkness and a million houses a year is at the moment, nothing but a slogan. The education ministry is wobbling and fumbling. The Transport Minister is more enmeshed in local politics than facing the challenges of his ministry. Lassa fever is still killing people months after it first broke out and health workers\u2019 strike are more the rule than the exception. Many of the other Ministers are yet to raise their hands and be counted. Kachikwu is doing a difficult job in difficult circumstances. He should be corrected when he makes careless and un-useful remarks. But his party should not be the first to send him to the gallows to be hung unless he turns out to be a common thief. And the calls for his resignation are premature. One thing that is emerging is that APC is not in sync with itself. It got to power on the promises of change but many of its members are averse to any fundamental change. Many are still concerned with position and self- aggrandisement. For how long can the centre hold? Related",

        "title": "Patriotism even in thievery",
        "author": "Josef Omorotionmwan",
        "text": "By Josef Omorotionmwan RICHARD Nixon (1913-1994), the 37th President of the United States of America; and Jacob Zuma, 74, the incumbent President of South Africa, are two of a kind. They share similarities in many areas: By dint of hard work, both rose to the pinnacle of power by becoming the Presidents of their countries. They were also the two Presidents who squandered State resources in revamping their private homes. This aspect is the main focus of today\u2019s write-up vis-\u00e0-vis a comparative analysis with the Nigerian situation. After the assassination of President John Fitzgerald Kennedy in 1963, Americans felt compelled to beef up security around their Presidents. Nixon was the US President from 1969 to 1974 when he became the only American President to ever resign that office. Nixon had earlier served as a member of the House of Representatives and Senator from California as well as US Vice President from 1953-1961. As soon as he became the US President, he squandered $17 million, in a criminal up-grade of his country home, in the name of presidential security. This smart lawyer outwitted America because what constituted presidential security was nowhere defined. But his action was an eye-opener. With the promulgation of the Impoundment Act, 1974, never again would any American be given a blank cheque under any guise. Similarly, on becoming the President of South Africa, Zuma substantially up-graded his private home in rural Nkandla \u2013 Kwazulu with State resources amounting to 216 million Rand (about $24 million). The Public Protector\u2019s report found that items like swimming pool, amphitheatre, cattle enclosure, chicken run, etc., contained in the up-grade had no relevance to presidential security. Even where the Constitutional Court of South Africa handed down what could be considered a loose ruling \u2013 that Zuma should refund \u201csome amount\u201d to the State \u2013 Zuma has stoically ignored the court ruling. Truly, Nixon got off the hook but the stigma on him is forever. If you go to America today, a present-generation American would quickly tell you, \u201cWe once had a bad President\u201d. As for Zuma, he is getting off the hook because \u2013 unlike Nigeria where a majority party in parliament would carelessly relinquish power to the minority party \u2013 the ANC, a party that knows its onions, will not allow Zuma to go down, even where a party veteran. Ahmed Kathrada \u2013 an antiapartheid stalwart who was jailed with Nelson Mandela \u2013 has joined the call for him to step down. All the same, the scar on Zuma remains permanent. Nixon and Zuma could have wished they were Nigerians. In Nigeria, when money talks, nobody walks. Nigeria is one place where no leader ever gets questioned for helping himself to any amount of public funds to build private mansions. Nigerians build and build, sometimes in utter contravention of the biblical assurance in the Book of Isaiah 65: 21-24 where God gave His children the blessed assurance that they would build their houses and inhabit them; and they would plant their vineyard and eat the fruits thereof. They would not build for others to inhabit; and neither would they plant for others to eat. Nigeria is the only place where people steal for other nations to prosper. It is a known fact that many Swiss and other foreign banks thrive on loots from Nigerian leaders. We are reminded of the numerous Nigerian leaders who have been named in the Panama Papers \u2013 a set of 11.5 million confidential documents detailing information on how more than 214,000 off-shore companies and other wealthy individuals hide stolen assets from public scrutiny. It is instructive that while those involved in the Panama leaks elsewhere are resigning their positions in shame, Nigerians involved are running around, apparently looking for where to steal more. The Prime Minister of Iceland, Sigmundur David Gunnlaugsson was the first leader to step aside in the wake of the Panama scandals. Someone was wondering why no prominent Americans have been named in the Panama Papers. He was quickly reminded that Americans are patriotic, even in thievery. What they steal are kept in American banks \u2013 circulating in, and developing, America. Nigerians steal to develop other lands. While the US and South Africa have developed to the level of questioning their leaders who pilfer small sums of public fund, Nigerians engaged in the stealing industry do theirs brazenly, with impunity and nobody questions them. In Abuja, a single military or civilian brass would own a sprawling estate with hundreds of duplexes and condominiums adorning an entire block and nobody raises an eye-brow. What of the case of a former Nigerian Head of State who invited a colleague from another African country to come and see his holdings? After the guided tour, the visitor surmised, \u201cAll these cannot be for one man in one life time\u201d. Corruption creeps into the life of a nation in various shades and colours. For instance, each time our Senators abandon their duty post to accompany their boss to the Code of Conduct Tribunal, as if they are part of the defence team, this comes at a cost of millions of Naira on the tax-payer in lost mann-hour. God make man; man made money; and money made man mad. Not too long ago, the Local Government Council Chairmen in a particular State formed themselves into a Club where they made a monthly contribution of N1million each. Of course, one bad turn deserves another. One of the Chairmen took his contribution and invested it on a property in an erosion course. In less than two years, erosion had completed the task of burying the property under sand and water. That\u2019s the nature of stolen wealth. It takes only one committed generation to rebuild a nation. We shall get there someday. Of necessity, Nigeria must invest more in the business of total re-orientation of society. By the time people realise the vanity and vainglory in the hazardous business of stealing; the propensity to embark on wanton looting of public funds will be drastically reduced. Related",

        "title": "The conscience of a reformer: Deregulation and social palliatives to restore Nigeria",
        "author": "Tabia Princewill",
        "text": "By Tabia Princewill A LOT has been said about the recent fuel price increase but not enough of this has taken into account the social palliatives accompanying it now that the budget has been passed and funds will be released. Too many of us still misunderstand the dire straits the Nigerian economy is in and totally misjudge how this is a direct consequence of corruption, which makes graft the number one issue to be tackled immediately if there is any hope of all others being resolved. NEW FUEL PRICE\u2014Minister of State, Petroleum, Dr. Ibe Kachikwu, briefing newsmen on the new fuel price, yesterday, in Abuja. Policymaking in Nigeria has been ineffective, not for a lack of ideas, or of brilliant minds and not merely due to poor implementation but mostly because funds to achieve stated goals are ruthlessly looted. Global funds donated to fight HIV/AIDS and malaria received by the Federal Ministry of Health (some estimates quote over 500 million US dollars received by successive Nigerian governments since 2003) have had no real impact on Nigerians, with donor agencies finally clamouring for an account of these funds (possibly because the international perception is thatwe now have a commander-in-chief ready to investigate). Subsidy removal This momentous fraud has been timelessly replicated across ministries and agencies, from power, to housing, to roads, education etc. so how can anyone reasonably claim \u201cwitch-hunt\u201d if not due to some complicity or attempts at a cover up? The clean up has to start somewhere and will eventually engulf all those whom corruption has stained. If a murder suspect were on trial, would we say his trial should be suspended till every single murderer is either tried or jailed? Corruption kills and deregulation is the first step to stemming the bleeding. Government has always practiced \u201ccure after death\u201d style medicine; it\u2019s now time for a (real) change. Yes, many were once against subsidy removal but making life \u201ceasier for the people\u201d cannot be sustained through crowd-pleasing yet ineffective measures. This is real change, telling people the truth as ugly and disappointing as it is, while providing support to the poorest and most vulnerable. The lack of said support was one of the reasons why I personally was opposed to subsidy removal under previous governments. I didn\u2019t trust previous leaders to use the subsidy savings judiciously: case in point, we have no savings today even after prolonged periods of oil selling at an all time high. Okonjo-Iweala who served as Finance minister during two \u201crich\u201d administrations cannot blame the lack of savings on pressure from governors: it was her job, as well as the two presidents she served, to make sure whatever was withdrawn from the Excess Crude Account (ECA) was properly used, the same goes for the recovered (allegedly re-looted)Abacha loot. It wouldn\u2019t be too much of an exaggeration to say state governors, federal ministers have \u201ccrimes against humanity\u201d to answer to. What did they do with funds from the ECA? Sure-P, designed to reinvest oil rents now looks like nothing but a scam. Nigeria is one of the least agriculturally mechanised countries in the world. Our farmers use manual, obsolete tools that haven\u2019t been seen since 19th century Europe\u2019s peasantry. Yet, we call attempts to fix all this a \u201cwitch-hunt\u201d! As a presidential candidate, Buhari said subsidy was \u201ca fraud\u201d (which it is) and that he\u2019d clean up the oil industry, resulting in the prices of petroleum products \u201ccoming down\u201d. In an ideal world, one where the \u201csubsidy cabal\u201d (and their political masters) were not so powerful, that should have been the case. A man who searches for different alternatives to tackle a problem when initial plans don\u2019t work is smart, not a liar. But how would we know, we\u2019ve become used to doing things the same way and expecting a different result! We called this NEEDS (National Economic Empowerment and Development Strategy), then a transformation agenda, we even had a so-called \u201cservant leader\u201d in between (whose family was intriguingly perturbed by the lack of paid adverts commemorating his death; people hardly seem to get this \u201cchange\u201d idea, but again, why should they, it goes against their very survival). Unproductive gains The only savvy way to tackle the \u201ccabal\u2019s\u201d influence and corrupt, unproductive gains was to use the current economic crisis and lack of FX to pay for subsidy, to Nigeria\u2019s advantage. Deregulation could not have been done 4 years ago when the petroleum ministry was the personal fiefdom of a few individuals, who\u2019ve now all curiously disappeared, some conveniently ill, others rumoured to be selling off their ill-acquired properties. Nigerians pay incredible, unrealistic prices for services because the providers know we\u2019ll find the money by whatever means, as we all merrily continue our association with corrupt politicians and the cabals they empowered, making them emissaries among us, representing and encouraging an unsustainable system. We\u2019ve all been living off the proceeds of political corruption and economic monopoly. This had to happen: we had to hit rock bottom to wake up. Let the little we have build roads not enrich a few hundred men buying private jets and fooling unknowing former presidents into believing this translates into Nigeria being a rich country! It makes a lot more senseto feed 5.5 million children, for 200 school days: this\u2019ll boost school attendance,spur agricultural production. Economic opportunity Such programmes have been successfully conducted in other countries, yet we in Nigeria would rather defend a wonky system where closeness to power enables subsidised economic opportunity, while those who don\u2019t benefit from any representation (in the National Assembly or at state government level) go hungry. The monthly N5000 stipend to the poorest amongst us will help combat the subsidy shocks, much like the billions budgeted for loans to artisans, trades, plus N60,000 for unemployed graduates. However, no amount of welfare could ever be enough to tackle poverty if we have no functioning infrastructure, power, modern healthcare centres, schools, roads and railways (construction will also drive employment). Those are the real triggers to lift Nigerians out of poverty.Rather than creating a few billionaires and calling this wealth-creation. This government will create hundreds of thousands of small-scale operatives who\u2019ll employ others in their communities. Social investments soften the impact of deregulation while creating a sustainable future for all. True reformers have a conscience: their improvements reorganise our character, restructure our beliefs from mindless consumption to production. Chibok girls Their parents should sue the past administration as well as officials who denied their very existence. The US government maintains the girls could have been rescued (they had intelligence regarding their whereabouts but couldn\u2019t act alone). Rescued Chibok girl, Amina Ali The Jews have never forgotten the Holocaust yet we in Nigeria have made a habit out of accepting the killing of our people due to our own selfishness and greed. Human rights lawyers should counsel the Chibok parents, especially in light of the $15 billion arms fraud which allowed Boko Haram to kidnap, rape and kill, virtually unchallenged. The parents\u2019 blood should boil at the thought that Dasuki claimed our soldiers were \u201ccowards\u201d. This same army, from Liberia to Sudan, assisted foreigners but couldn\u2019t save its own. Corruption is a crime against humanity. Amnesty programme Would the US government pay terrorists not to destroy infrastructure? What governments across the world do, however, is to minimise the social factors, which lead to unrest in the first place. If the Niger Delta oil spills had been properly tackled and fishing hubs hadn\u2019t been destroyed, if the NDDC had done its job, if state governors had done more than enrich themselves, we wouldn\u2019t be talking about paying people not to harm themselves. Rumours of unrest in the Niger Delta being connected to the possible arrest of former President Goodluck Jonathan are outrageous yet full of meaning: do militants fear the end of wasteful contracts which didn\u2019t develop the region beyond creating rich militants? The rule of law must prevail: any Nigerian can be called upon by the EFCC, especially if evidence of their negligence and possible complicity cost a country and its citizens so much. Related",

        "author": "Owei Lakemfa",
        "text": "By Owei Lakemfa THE Mediterranean Sea for three days last week claimed over seven hundred lives. The extent of this tragedy, was enough for the United Nations to call an emergency Security Council meeting. But no serious reaction came from those who claim to be protectors of the human race. On Wednesday, May 25, a boat carrying about 600 persons capsized. The body count is on-going. The next day, a boat which did not have an engine but nevertheless carried 670 souls, capsized as it was being towed by another boat. Five hundred and fifty persons from this boat, are missing. Then on Friday, May 27, another boat, sank. No part of humanity can wash its hands off these tragedies. Not since the Irish Potato Famine of 1845-1852 which resulted in about 1.3 million deaths and over one million Irish taking to the seas in so called Coffin Ships to reach England, Wales, Australia and North America, has humanity witnessed such calamity. The Irish journeys were so tragic that for instance, over 20,000 Irish of the 100,000 that headed for Canada in 1847 perished either on the way or on arrival. But the 170 years that separate the desperate Irish sea journey to America and the current one to Europe, should have prepared humanity against this 21st century calamity. What makes the current case worse, is that while the Irish famine was a combination of natural and British-tailored disasters, the current one is essentially man-made. Forty one percent of the those making the precarious journey to Europe, are Syrians fleeing war. The war in Syria is a proxy one by the United States, Europe and some Middle East countries to get rid of the Bashar al-Assad Government. To achieve this, they created, trained, armed and funded ISIS which has become an uncontrollable monster. Twenty one percent are Afghans; a long suffering people. The Afghan Civil War of December 1979 to February 1989 was a proxy one reflecting the Cold War. The defunct Soviet Union and its Warsaw Pact allies supported the Government while the United States and its NATO allies, established, trained and funded the Mujahideen rebels. The latter attracted young Muslims from the Arab world like Osama Bin laden to fight in the war. Laden created the al-Qaeda which was accused of being responsible for the horrendous 9/11 attacks in United States. The Americans and their allies invaded Afghanistan to get Bin Laden out; 26,270 civilians have been killed since 2001, Bin Laden is dead, but the war continues. So for many Afghans, the choice is to flee. Thirteen percent are Iraqis. That country under Sadam Hussein was fiercely anti-terrorist. Under the false claims that the country had Weapons of Mass Destruction and was a State Sponsor of Terrorism, America, Britain and their allies including Australia, Denmark, Poland, invaded it from March 20, 2003. They succeeded in destroying Sadam and his regime, and of course, Iraq itself. Iraq became a failed state, ISIS carved out large portions of it for its Caliphate, the victors control its oil and many became refugees. Apart from those trying to escape violence in Somalia, Libya and Pakistan, these figures show that 75 percent of the refugees are from the war torn countries of Syria, Afghanistan and Iraq, which gives a lie to claims that they are mainly, economic refugees. Even the few economic refugees reflect partly, the failure of globalisation to meet basic human needs that will make living meaningful. A world of desperate people who have nothing to live for, cannot be a safe one. People fleeing violence, hunger and uncertainty for whom possible watery death, is preferable to living in their countries, cannot be stopped. In 2015, we lost over 3,500 of such people to the seas, while in the first five months of this year, at least 2,500 have been lost. Those lost to the seas, sometimes with their entire families, had hopes of a better life and future; they had loved ones who looked forward to seeing them. A humanity that will cry over the killing of a lion, weep for the shooting of a gorilla and mourn the passing of a dog, but has no tears for 700 human beings drowned in the seas over three days in avoidable tragedies, needs to re-examine itself. After over six decades of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, and humanity getting to the level of protesting the detention of a single individual, the impression was that all human lives matter; so why does it look the other way when hundreds of people are drowned at sea? Is it because they are poor, defenceless people? In the past five months, over 2,500 people are either dead or missing in the tidal waves of the Mediterranean Sea compared to 3,500 in the whole of 2015. What this shows is that painful watery graves, are no deterrent, nor are the wooly-headed measures taken to stop more people taking to the seas. The Australia option of dumping refugees in detention camps outside its shores, is criminal. The European Union measure of blocking the refugees from leaving Greece and pushing them to large holding centres in Turkey \u2013 having bribed that country with money and promises of incorporation into EU and visa-free programme \u2013 will also not work. In fact, this new EU \u2018policy\u2019 has made the crises even more bizarre. While some months ago, the precarious journey in the seas to reach Europe, was undertaken from Asia and Africa, now those who survived the seas to get to Greece, are undertaking another dangerous sea journey; an intra-European one from Greece to Italy. In the short term, humanity needs to welcome the migrants. In the medium, Europe, Australia, America and other destinations of choice for the refugees, should provide visa for the most vulnerable which to me, are those fleeing wars and violence. On the long term, we need to address the core reasons for this migration including ending the wars in Iraq, Afghanistan, Yemen and Syria, defeating ISIS and terrorism, and evolving a just globalisation from which all humanity will benefit.

        "author": "Henry Boyo",
        "text": "By Henry Boyo The release of licenses, in June this year, to 65 Nigerian companies to establish local refineries must be welcome news to everyone who is unhappy with the overwhelming Foreign Exchange bill for our fuel imports. The licenses were granted barely two weeks after President Buhari\u2019s inauguration, and probably provide a strong indication of PMB\u2019s burning desire to reduce Nigeria\u2019s huge fuel import bill and hopefully also reduce or eliminate the incidence of subsidy in fuel pricing. A refinery Indeed, in an attempt to attract investors to this venture, the Department of Petroleum Resources(DPR) is reported to have reduced the licensing fee for new refineries from $1million to just $50,000. It is however, not yet clear if the 18 companies which had earlier paid $1m and received licenses since 2002 to establish refineries would now be favored with a partial refund to maintain some level of equity in the application fee. Nevertheless, Nigerians may also wonder why, till date, only one of the 18 licensed companies had actually come on stream with a modest capacity for just 1,000 bpd output of diesel. Curiously, industry observers may similarly wonder why nothing came out of the celebrated Memorandum of Understanding signed between the Federal government with an American and Nigerian Joint Venture Group in July 2012 for the construction, within 12 months, of six modular refineries, with a combined capacity of 180,000 bpd at an estimated cost of about $4.5bn. Incidentally, the promoters of the project had claimed that, within 30 months, \u201cthe six refineries would produce 30m litres per day of refined products, as the entire modular refinery complex, including all piping and electrical fittings would be built and test operated in the United States to ensure that each of the six plants will achieve 100% of their projected average 5m litres per day production capacity before 2015. The firm assurance by Olusegun Aganga, the serving Minister of Trade and Investment, at that time, that his ministry would work together with the DPR and the NNPC to ensure the actualization of the project, makes the apparent failure of the venture, more disturbing. Instructively, Nigeria\u2019s estimated daily domestic demand of about 40m litres would have been adequately covered if existing government refineries produced just 10m litres to compliment the output expected from the 2012 MOU with the American-Nigerian consortium. Indeed, in July 2012, we had cautioned in a related article titled \u201c6 new refineries, Hurray, but not yet Uhuru\u201d that \u201cin its anxiety to facilitate adequate fuel supply, the Nigerian government appeared constrained to fetch water with a porous and poorly cellotaped basket! The ultimate result can only be frustration and failure\u201d. The unanswered question therefore, is why companies which received licenses to establish refineries continue to dash our expectations for self sufficiency in fuel supplies. With this hindsight, what changes, we may ask, have now been made to guarantee that the 2015 batch of 65 licensees would not also disappear and frustrate our country\u2019s hopes of ultimately becoming a net exporter of fuel.

Go to the creeks and see the way the so called illegal refineries are refining pms and dpk as pure as what we import...if not of higher quality...how much did it cost them to set up these local and illegal refineries? If you watched channels TV news last week, you'd see the manner at which the navy were destroying those illegal refineries in the creeks. Inside 2 drums, they showed viewers the diesel that was just refined, as pure as the imported ones. These guys in my opinion need to be empowered to set up  modular refineries that can consolidate and complement  the productivity of the big ones.</p>",

        "author": "Donu Kogbara",
        "text": "By Donu Kogbara Last week, I told you that I was in London and had just voted in the European Union, EU, Referendum. The British Prime Minister, David Cameron, had triggered off the Referendum to give citizens and residents of the United Kingdom, UK, a chance to decide whether they wanted the UK to leave or remain in the EU. By now, most Vanguard readers will be aware that the majority stubbornly ignored sound advice from august bodies and serious individuals \u2013 the International Monetary Fund and Barack Obama, for example \u2013 and voted to leave the EU. Jeremy Corbyn and Jeremy Corbyn Most of you will also be aware that this decision has had devastating consequences, the most obvious being that the Pound plunged to its lowest level for over 30 years. Meanwhile, Cameron has shocked almost everyone by resigning, thereby plunging his ruling Conservative Party into a period of chronic uncertainty and into the disruption of having to elect a replacement Prime Minister at very short notice. Lacklustre campaigning The opposition Labour Party is also going through turmoil. Many Labour parliamentarians are convinced that their leader, Jeremy Corbyn, is partly to blame for the Referendum result because of his lackluster campaigning during the run-up to the historic vote. They say that Corbyn did not \u201csell\u201d the benefits of EU membership vigorously enough to the ordinary working people who are Labour\u2019s backbone; and they have just passed a No Confidence motion in him. Scots and the Northern Irish are also furious because most of them voted to stick with the European mainland and don\u2019t see why they should be dragged out of their comfort zone by the English and Welsh\u2026so much for \u201cthe United Kingdom\u201d! Despite the above economic, regional, political and psychological tensions \u2013 and my own disappointment about the Referendum outcome \u2013 I believe that Britain will overcome the multiple downsides of its exit from the EU (\u201cBrexit\u201d) within a reasonable time span\u2026and that it will eventually find positive new ways of relating to Europe and continue to be held in high esteem in other parts of the world. I voted \u201cBremain\u201d (for Britain to remain in the EU) because I felt and still feel that while the EU is and will always be far from perfect, it is an essentially benign institution that is not flawed enough to justify an anger-fuelled withdrawal. Yes, the EU is too bureaucratic. Yes, the EU is full of unelected officials who are not answerable to EU electorates. Yes, many EU executives enjoy excessively high salaries and expenses. Yes, the EU passes laws that challenge the sovereignty of the British Parliament and its legislative counterparts in other member nations. Yes, because of the EU\u2019s rules about free movement of persons across borders, Britain attracts hundreds of thousands of immigrants from poorer EU countries who are putting pressure on public resources like the National Health Service. As a matter of fact, the immigrant influx was the single biggest concern that those who voted Brexit expressed. The xenophobic politicians who lobbied for Brexit exploited their fears. And there have been hard-working, honest and useful. Anyway, at the end of the day, the EU does a lot of good overall. In addition to promoting enlightenment, a healthy tolerance of diversity, pacifism and unity, the EU delivers substantial amounts of concrete development aid to deprived areas within and outside Europe. It helps Nigeria, for instance. And quite a few British locations, organisations and people have also benefitted from EU funding. My son, Oliver, is 21; and he and his friends all \u2013 like most youngsters in the UK \u2013 voted Bremain because they are instinctively cosmopolitan and enthusiastically committed to multiculturalism; and they are incensed that their elders (a vast swathe of Brexiteers are pensioners who yearn for a return to \u201cThe Good Old Days\u201d when Britain was largely white and monocultural) tipped the balance. Oliver, his generation and some of their parents believe in the concept of the Brotherhood Of Man and feel completely comfortable about the fact that the new Mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, is the Muslim son of Asian immigrants. But, sadly, London \u2013 which voted overwhelmingly to remain in the EU \u2013 is not typical. There are many traditional Britons outside the sophisticated capital city who are bewildered and appalled by Sadiq Khan\u2019s elevation, regard such developments as suicidal and are grimly determined to prevent \u201cforeigners\u201d from \u201ctaking over.\u201d I like Cameron. But I wish he had not tried to be a Great Democrat! There are times when an authoritarian approach makes sense! He didn\u2019t HAVE to cave into Eurosceptic/Europhobic demands for a Referendum. It was an unnecessary gamble. Ah well. Never mind. No use crying over spilled milk. Britain is, in my opinion, a special country. It has always punched above its weight. At one point, during its imperial era, this small island controlled a quarter of the earth\u2019s surface. And it still has a mighty Commonwealth, comprising its former colonial territories. English, meanwhile, happens to be the most widely spoken language on the planet. And while I reckon that the British would have been much better-off staying in the EU, I\u2019m pretty sure that Britain will, ultimately, not drown without the EU. Frivolous show-offs \u2014 follow up Last week, I complained about a recent British TV programme that starred the youthful scions of two famous Nigerian clans \u2013 the Otedolas and Mbadiwes. I accused them of being frivolous, boastful, vacuous, pretensious and insensitive. Several Vanguard readers have subsequently contacted me to ask how they can access the documentary I complained about. For those who are interested, it is titled \u201cLagos To London: Britain\u2019s New Super-Rich\u201d and available on You Tube. Related",

        "author": "Tabia Prince will",
        "text": "By Tabia Prince will Watching the UK Conservative Party\u2019s change of leadership which resulted in Theresa May succeeding David Cameron as the country\u2019s Prime Minister, I was struck by the many parallels between good and bad behaviour in the UK and Nigeria. The smooth way with which the Conservative Party resolved its leadership tussle should be something to be studied by fledgling democracies such as ours, where to contest for leadership is hardly ever about ideas and service to one\u2019s country but rather about the promise of corruption and economic recklessness. Theresa May\u2019s main opponent, Andrea Leadsom dropped out of the race when she realised she was no longer the party favourite: her unfortunate comments about Mrs May\u2019s childlessness aside, her willingness to put the party\u2019s interests first is something almost unheard of in Nigeria (after all, she didn\u2019t invade her party\u2019s headquarters with thugs). I\u2019m left feeling wistful every time politicians in other climes exhibit behaviour which is so far from the norm in Nigeria. When will we see our own Obamas, Camerons and Theresa Mays? Men and women who were raised with principles, who are not motivated by money alone? People with an agenda beyond ethnicity and religious manipulation? Senator Oluremi Tinubu and Dino Melaye Religious manipulation Neither candidate threatened secession or civil war nor did the loser claim that a cabal, or a government within the government is behind her woes and preventing her rise to power. In fact, it is quite amazing (by Nigerian political standards) that neither of these two women has ever been accused of corruption, forgery, embezzlement, or sordid sexual proclivities or any of the many heinous things Nigerian politicians take for granted. Our nation\u2019s grandees\u2019 lack of propriety or principles is no longer news. The Nasarawa State chapter of the Nigeria Labour Congress recently announced the state government borrowed N28 billion from different banks, from 2011 to date, and therefore demands payment of workers\u2019 salaries. But a bigger question remains: what did the state do with N28 billion? It\u2019s not enough to get angry at Cameron for calling Nigeria \u201cfantastically corrupt\u201d. Rather, we should be angry at those who\u2019ve consistently done little for the common good and whose greed has left our states so poor. We are the butt of international jokes about poverty and corruption. Rather than being angry at those who laugh at us, we should be angry at those who make it so easy for us to be laughed at. The Ohanaeze Ndigbo Youth Council has called on Nigerians to ignore Festus Keyamo, a lawyer and popular public commentator who says Dr. Uche Ogah should be sworn in as Governor of Abia State as the election of the incumbent governor has been invalidated. I always wonder who exactly is behind the so-called youth groups in Nigeria who curiously only speak about political issues but never about the real every day matters which affect Nigerians. Even more strange is the fact that these youth groups seem to be the antithesis of everything youth in other parts of the world stands for: openness, oneness in the pursuit of common opportunities for development, justice for all rather than sectional, ethno-religious interests, etc. Are the youth groups who attend UN summits, campaigning for reconciliation between peoples, from Mars? No, they are cut from the same cloth as the Theresa Mays, Camerons, etc, which I mentioned earlier. Their education and not simply their wealth, makes them part of a thinking elite which knows that service to politicians does not mean service to one\u2019s community. We must not just yearn for a country where our contemporaries hold these beliefs as true but work towards it. I\u2019ll end by encouraging us to think about a shocking incident, which one person concerned has since partly denied, that is the alleged altercation between Senators Dino Melaye and Remi Tinubu. But before that, let\u2019s go back to Theresa May and David Cameron, it\u2019s an interesting parallel. You see, following the #Brexit vote, then Prime Minister, David Cameron, promptly resigned and no one within his party or the society said he should receive a Nobel prize for doing what was right. When the public so blatantly disagrees with a leaders\u2019 policy or direction, honourable men and women in civilised societies leave way for others. This is not Nigerian thinking, ours is a more \u201cdo-or-die\u201d approach where militancy avenges only the interests of the powerful, an attitude whereby sabotage and petty jealousy feature heavily. Notice how Mrs May hasn\u2019t hinted that Cameron\u2019s people in Number 10 sabotaged her in any way, as the civil service is apolitical, unlike ours; so transitions are smooth no matter what persons or parties are in power. What a democracy! Cameron showed little ego in stepping down. He was full of good humour, and quips, some about himself, saying: \u201cI was the future once\u201d (in reference to a wisecrack he made about Tony Blair when he, Cameron, was a young Member of Parliament). The confidence and certitude that there is a future outside of politics enables men like Cameron to walk away serenely, their honour and good name intact. In our society, one must ask about most politicians: who were they, what was their call to fame, or simply, their occupation, before public office? Enter Dino Melaye. In defence of his \u201cfriend\u201d, the Senate President, Mr Melaye\u2019s alleged behaviour seems to have been the total opposite of what is allowed or encouraged in saner climes. I\u2019m sure Mr Cameron also has friends in Parliament. It is intriguing that none were alleged to have threatened to beat or rape a female colleague for daring to suggest that the institution they represent shouldn\u2019t be dragged into any one individual\u2019s court cases. Dragging on his premiership One can also easily surmise that if Cameron were accused of corruption, he would resign to clear his name. But what would Theresa May have responded to Dino Melaye? The exchange would never occur because Mr Melaye has no equivalent in the UK Parliament. Even Trump, as careless with his words as he has been, hasn\u2019t been accused of saying he would \u201crape\u201d or \u201cbeat\u201d Hillary Clinton. Cameron did the right thing for his country by refusing to drag on his premiership. On the opposite end, we in Nigeria routinely excuse and explain away bad behaviour or as we call it \u201cmere allegations\u201d. Take Senator Bukar Abba Ibrahim, a former governor of Yobe State who, in defence of Bukola Saraki reportedly said: \u201cI can assure you that 99 percent of senators are behind Saraki for the simple reason that we are all human beings, and we do make mistakes. When you are a governor for eight years, there is no way you can account for every kobo. So, if anybody wants to investigate you thoroughly, he will find a fault here and there.\u201d Where does one begin, without being choked by bile and disgust for the system that enables such a thought process? In the words of Thomas Jefferson: \u201cI tremble for my country when I reflect that God is just; that is justice cannot sleep forever\u201d. Alleged dismissal of judges The Nigeria Judicial Council, NJC, has reportedly dismissed Justice Mohammed Yunusa for granting an injunction stopping the EFCC from probing Stella Oduah. It seems Thomas Jefferson was right. Let me clarify, it\u2019s not about witch-hunting anyone. Rather, it\u2019s about everyone with a case to answer having their day in court, as is done all over the world. Obanikoro The EFCC has apparently been interrogating the former Minister\u2019s daughter, in relation to an alleged N800 million transaction. One must wonder, again, if Cameron, Theresa May or any one of their associates\u2019 children have access to such sums and what makes these things, if proven true, possible in Nigeria. Mrs Obanikoro who was also interrogated, is said to suffer from high blood pressure. Related",

This write-up is a well researched work on our degenerated attitude in Nigeria as to compare with other country where Nigeria has enough stake and with similar democratic principles invoke. But the response of some individuals in this shows that we are still in the dark ages. Let me call the attention of some people who have out resentment or selfishness criticized this write-up that governance in any progressive nation does not recognize ethic sentiments or relationship of any form. Nigerians are so perverted by past regimes that nothing goes outside \"do-or-die\" affairs and our leaders are only there for money, not even fame of interest of the people that elected them. Though Buhari is taking the trend of a game-changer, though very myopic people in the society don't seem to understand him. The issue is that we all know that 99.9% of Nigeria politicians are corrupt and culpable, but nevertheless, Buhari will not try all the  corrupt people same time. There are some innocent (but very corrupt) politicians and servicemen working with him which everybody know. But Buhari can't try them now because if he does, they will rock his boat, because they are the people that planted him. <br>However, from what the writer has said we lack decorum in our nation because we have not learnt enough on the principles of democracy. As the white man says; \"a little learning is dangerous\". It dangerous in our system as it has occasioned many abuses on the rule of law and utter-mostly a negation of democratic principles. Why has the senate president still seating as the head of the senate with numerous allegations of fraud hovering over his head. And still people align with him as friends or associates, it is not the same in an good society where people abhor crimes. <br>To augment his allusions on Nigeria's democracy, I should recommend Nigerians for ethical orientations training to imbue in them patriotism and good value system to reduce  the high level of greed among its citizens and socials malady in the Nigeria society by any means.  Also a good educational system is very important as Nigerian schools and Universities are milling out junks who are not qualified to be of any good to the society.</p>",

        "title": "The unravelling of #BBOG",
        "author": "Yinka Odumakin",
        "text": "By Yinka Odumakin GOD bless the soul of Senator Abraham Adesanya on the other side of eternity.There was no one who stayed around the late good old man for long that would not remember his depth of Yoruba philosophy with his wisecracks and anecdotes. #BBOGmarchesToVilla I remember this one whenever there was multitude of counsels and he suspected the motives of counsellors .He would share the story of the day a king\u2019s horse went missing and a search party went to work in a jiffy with many of the actors desperately trying to show the king that they cared. As the exercise was going on, a wise one leaned on the wall with his right hand on his chin, stamping his foot on the earth. He looked at the army of searchers and started labelling the formations within it.He said there were those who cared for the King and would go to any length to search for the missing horse. He identified another group as those who would pursue the horse to a never-to-be -seen-again destination. And that there were those that would outrightly kill the horse if they found it in a spot where no one would see them to report what they did. But to the king they all were a search party. This anecdote has been ringing in my head, having watched security agencies twice in a week turning back the BringBackOurGirls group or what is left of it from accessing the presidential villa in what I am suspecting as a pre-clampdown on the group if they continued to make a \u201cnuisance\u201d of themselves at the seat of power in the days ahead. The wicked carting away of over 200 Chibok schoolgirls in 2014 in very mysterious and suspicious circumstance threw the whole country into a frenzy. Someday we still would have to confront how 200 human beings (more than the passengers that would load a Boeing 737 plane) would be taken through many checkpoints without anyone suspecting foul play if there was no connivance at highest level. In the midst of the national outrage came the BringBackOurGirls campaign with the hashtag #BBOG going viral. It surfaced in world capitals, including the White House. The world media became focussed on Nigeria and a little brat from the CNN was in Abuja treating our then Information Minister, Labaran Maku, like a school kid.The local media were not left out as activities of the group enjoyed hours of live coverage and undisguised manifestations of cashing in on the misfortune of the Chibok parents as a tool of regime change. Only the pathetically naive would not see through that it was less of the search for the missing girls than the campaign for the polls that were ahead. Not one protest took place in Borno State where the tragic incident occurred and no one asked the governor of the state any question. But like the king whose horse got missing, the poor parents assumed that all the noise was about their musing daughters. How would they suspect that a sinister agenda was playing out with their hapless daughters as cannon fodders. When power eventually changed hands on March 28,2015 it was as of the girls were going to be part of the inauguration ceremony on May 29. The campaign suddenly ebbed momentarily. Major activists of the movement were rewarded with plum positions in government. Perhaps those ones know so well what the script was all about ab initio. Sixteen months after,only one girl has been brought back and it was one of those who abandoned the campaign for plum job in government that was invited to come and present the found girl at the presidential villa. The remnants of the movement were slow in getting the message that they were already becoming irritants and pests. In fairness to the remnants who must have been under the mistaken impression that the heavy support that came their way under the ancient regime was all on account of the campaign for the missing girls sake,they kept faith with the campaign by the time it dawned on them that the Chibok girls were not on the front burner as they thought it would be. The recent video by the evil group Boko Haram on the girls brought a renewed vigor to the movement which has depleted. Some 50 girls were shown with a gunman who demanded the release of fighters in return for the girls, and said some girls died in air strikes. The non-Muslim girls were forced to convert to Islam, and it is feared that many of the schoolgirls have been sexually abused and forced into \u201cmarriage\u201d by their captors. Parents of the missing girls described their anguish at seeing their daughters in captivity. The video started with a shot of a masked man, carrying a gun, speaking to the camera. He said that some of the girls have been wounded and have life-threatening injuries, and that 40 have been \u201cmarried\u201d. Speaking in the Hausa language, the gunman said the girls on display will \u201cnever\u201d be returned if the government does not release Boko Haram fighters who have been \u201cin detention for ages\u201d. The video concluded with footage of bodies, said to be the victims of air strikes, lying on the ground at another location. The militant also carries out a staged interview with one of the captives, who called herself Maida Yakubu, in which she asked parents to appeal to the government. Another girl among those standing in the background can be seen with a baby. Some of the girls can be seen weeping as Maida speaks. Official response to the video fell below the expectations of the movement which has led to the latest rounds of agitations around the seat of government which is being warded off by security agencies. And as if to expose the many forces that buoyed the #BBOG in the past as self-serving .American Secretary of State Mr John Kerry recently visited Nigeria-half of Nigeria to be precise-and we did not hear a word about the Chibok girls in all his speeches in his meetings with the Sultan,the President and five governors from the North. It is amazing how those who were campaigning in Washington two years ago on the missing girls would now have a high official in Sokoto and Abuja and the girls they so loved a while ago would no longer be in the reckoning. What should the remnants of the movement now do as it seems a crackdown is imminent if they continued to pester government over the abducted girls? They should avoid a confrontation as much as possible so that attention is not shifted from the missing girls to broken ankles and injured heads. Given the character of Nigerian law enforcement since the colonial days,it is not wise to give opportunity for a test of the instrument of violence against them. Am I saying they should abandon the campaign? No! The column that was lumped with other \u201csearchers\u201d should continue to give hope to the parents of the abducted girls through activities that do not involve confrontation with law enforcement apparatus . The distraught parents should on their part not become forlorn and give up hope on their kidnapped daughters who are presently at the mercy of these evil minded men.They should draw strength from the three Hebrews who were thrown into the fiery furnace and were expected to burn into ashes until the fourth man showed up in the fire. Daniel should have been meat for the lion but he came out unscathed. Some day,when these girls would have been reunited with their parents as our God liveth,there would be some closure to this inhumanity to young women by these marauders and evil forces. For now we keep remembering them. We Remember Them\u2026 In the rising of the sun and in its going down, We remember them; In the blowing of the wind and in the chill of winter, We remember them; In the opening of buds and in the warmth of summer, We remember them; In the rustling of leaves and the beauty of autumn, We remember them; In the beginning of the year and when it ends, We remember them; When we are weary and in need of strength, We remember them; When we are lost and sick at heart, We remember them; When we have joys we yearn to share, We remember them; So long as we live, they too shall live For they are now a part of us as We remember them. *From Gates of Prayer, Judaism Prayer Book Related",

        "title": "WAI, a war for the poor",
        "author": "None",
        "text": "ON Monday, August 8, 2016, we were told that the Federal Government had revived the War Against Indiscipline, WAI, a priority programme of Major General Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s 1984/85 military regime. It was under the control of the late Major General Tunde Idiagbon, his Deputy (Chief of Staff, Supreme Headquarters). Buhari was also conducting the most barbaric war against corruption to deal with politicians who allegedly stole from the public treasury or collected bribes or inflated contracts. The Special Military Tribunals, SMT\u2019s, were set up, and politicians, both the guilty and innocent, were jailed and stripped of their legitimate and illegitimate earnings. Buhari used the SMT\u2019s to impoverish the political class; many of them went to their untimely graves. He damaged the Nigerian political class in the same way that General Murtala Mohammed destroyed the Civil Service. The immediate import of it was that when politicians came back to the scene under General Ibrahim Babangida\u2019s transition programme, treasury looting became the first incentive for getting involved in politics, and the \u201cbad guys\u201d started having a bazaar. Buhari never told us how much he recovered from the politicians, and what he did with it. The SMT was his unpalatable menu for the \u201cbig men\u201d. For the masses, he unfolded WAI. He felt that the best way to address the general atmosphere of indiscipline and lack of love for the country was to use the military to force people to queue up instead of struggling to outdo one another in a savage demonstration of \u201cmight is right\u201d. People were told not to give or take bribes, but no one told us how many bribe-givers and takers were prosecuted and jailed. Military governors forced civil servants to resume work on time and stay till closure of work, (though this was observed in breach). The famous monthly National Environmental Sanitation Days, which took place every last Saturday of the month ( which is still largely observed in many states) was introduced. Again, soldiers and other security agencies were on hand to implement it. They did it the only way they knew how. If you were caught violating any of the rules in public, you were \u201cfrog-jumped\u201d and beaten to the soldier\u2019s heart\u2019s content. It was later that some states introduced Mobile Courts to try violators of the sanitation exercise. A unique attribute of WAI was that it was mostly the poor people who walked the streets, markets and open spaces that were caught in the soldiers\u2019 net. They were the ones that the soldiers could beat and kick around. Don\u2019t get me wrong. WAI did have some salutary effects. When Buhari was toppled, many people went back to their old ways, but a few Nigerians stayed true to it. The Environmental Day has endured, somewhat. WAI was quite effective while it lasted because the officer in charge of implementing it \u2013 General Idiagbon \u2013 was committed to it. But when the regime was overthrown, his successor Babangida, scrapped Buhari\u2019s WAI and formed his Mass Mobilisation for Self Reliance, Social Justice and Economic Recovery, MAMSER, which Professor Jerry Gana headed. MAMSER\u2019s efforts produced the best presidential election ever in Nigeria\u2019s history \u2013 on June 12, 1993. It was won by Alhaji Moshood Abiola of the Social Democratic Party, SDP. Babangida, in a fit of regional arrogance and abuse of power, annulled the election and scrapped his own MAMSER. He formed the National Orientation Agency which subsists till date. Successive regimes starved the NOA of funds, and Alhaji Idi Faruk, as its Director General, settled for sponsored seminars from state to state to keep the Agency alive. What am I saying? Buhari\u2019s WAI, enforced with brute military force and impunity, only worked while he was in power, though some of its relics remain. Babangida\u2019s persuasive MAMSER worked by producing the most detribalised election in Nigeria, but the election was annulled and its winner murdered. Nigeria returned to the era when politicians\u2019 supporters killed innocent people when they lost election, and the leader boasted more killing would take place if he lost again. The masses saw that the leaders were not serious with social re-engineering. Now how do you do it right? How do they do it in other countries we love to go and spend our money? How did our leaders do it before the soldiers came in with their \u201csalvage mission\u201d mentality? The answer is simple: Make the laws and other dos and don\u2019ts (which we have already over-made). Explain them to the people through socialisation or orientation. The \u201cpeople\u201d means everybody, from the President to the peasant, no sacred cows. Use every unit of society to spread the message \u2013 the families, schools, religious organs, media (especially radio, television and the Internet) and traditional institutions. Let the people know that the law is for their own good, and it is no respecter of person \u2013 even the President, Emir, Bishop or Dibia. Lead by example. Don\u2019t tell them: \u201cI feel your pain\u201d when your food bill alone is in billions. Then organise the law-enforcement agencies to enforce the law. Anyone who does not want to come along willingly will have to come along unwillingly. Pay the law enforcers well. Take care of their welfare. Equip them. Motivate them. But hold them to account by ensuring they work within the same law. This is pretty basic stuff, which our colonial masters left with us and soldiers threw away. The typical Nigerian has lost faith in government and its agencies because government does not work for them. He faces his hardships, providing light, water, security, education and other things that government should give him. He watches those he elected on the platform of \u201cchange\u201d wearing designer shoes and watches, riding in a royal cortege when they return from medical holidays abroad over mundane illnesses such as ear ache, spending our scarce foreign exchange to train their children and relations in elite universities abroad and planting them in the juiciest of our government agencies such as the CBN, NNPC and what have you, when they graduate. WAI? No! Related",

        "author": "Treena Kwenta",
        "text": "\u2013 the funloving, but hardworking single parent By Treena Kwenta Hi readers! I had ardently hoped that Rose, the pretty girl in Accounts, would be among those who would choose to leave voluntarily to go get jobs elsewhere, but to my chagrin, she wasn't. What to do? Tayo had advised that I should throw her out because she might be a big distraction to Shola when he starts coming over to Seb's company to help put the place in good financial shape. We hadn't retrenched, so it would be awkward to ask her to leave just like that. For days, I agonized over how I should handle the matter in a way that wouldn't set the workers against me. Rose, in spite of her penchant for 'borrowing' some of the money she's recovered from the debtors, and her 'on-the-premises affairs,\u00c2 she is liked by many workers there. I like her myself because she's friendly, warm and polite to me. Besides, she always has hard-luck stories to tell at any given time. How can you give such a person the boot without being called heartless? Yes, I know you have to be firm when managing a company, but \u2026 If there were any way I could retain her but hide her away from amorous Shola, I would have done so, but that wasn't possible. I must confess it was with some trepidation that I\u00c2 agreed to Shola's coming. He was going to be using my official office there while I use Seb's. I got in early and went to open the connecting door to see if the office had been well-cleaned. I almost fainted when I saw Shola in his chair having a chat with Rose who was leaning against a wall. Wao! He's sure a fast mover when it comes to women, I told myself. I glanced from one to the other. He gave Rose a nod of dismissal, and she, after\u00c2 greeting me respectfully, left the room. \"So, Treena the love of my life, how are you doing today?\"\u009d asked Shola, half his attention on me and the other half on the file in front of him. \"My desk at CLAWS is piled high with work, so, I got in here early so that I can leave at 2pm to go squeeze a day's work into the remaining hours over there. Come on, say something, Treena dear. You look dazed. Are you alright?\"\u009d \"Good morning Shola. I'm very alright.\u00c2 Er, I know you're a grown man, and you're single, but that lady who just left here can be an unholy distraction to your work here. I'm not saying she eats men alive, but er, she's got quite a reputation for office romance. Be warned.\"\u009d \"Oh, that's it, then! Thanks for the warning Treena, my love. Rose is old stuff as far as my romantic feelings are concerned..\"\u009d \"You mean you've already had a relationship with her? That's comforting and re-assuring. It means you won't be panting after her during your tenure here. I'd be most delighted if you can give this work your utmost attention so that the company can recover in record time. Promise there will be no office romance here, Shola dear. I'm sorry if I've offended you by what I've just said, but anxiety about this company is making me lose weight by the second. You don't want to add to the stress, do you? Certainly not if I'm the love of your life as you've been saying all these years.\"\u009d \"Er, well, why don't you marry me, and then you can be sure that I'll never indulge in any affair, whatever the attraction, for the rest of my life? If I have you for myself legitimately, I'll never look at another woman. You can bring the Bible, the Koran, Ifa, and other symbols of faith and I'll swear on them. I can't break my word. Not when it has to do with you. Marry me, Treena dear, and I'll go straight, right from this minute.\"\u009d I looked at the clown with some anxiety. I had to humour him. You never know how serious he is when in the mood for proposing marriage. Whatever the case I didn't want him refusing to help put the company in fine shape. Dare said he was the Mr. Fixit that we needed. Would he make a relationship a condition for acceptance? Surely, the Shola I know wouldn't be that calculating. But then you never can be sure. Apart from the fact that I'm not interested in tying the knot again, Shola's a no-go area in that matter. Who wants to be step-mother to about twenty children from an assorted type of women? Only an angel of a woman would put her head in that sort of net. Still, I had to be careful in my response that morning.\u00c2 I shouldn't upset him to the point that he would get up and leave. In desperation an idea hit me. \"Treena love, I don't know why you have to hesitate to accept to be my wife,\"\u009d he was saying. \"I'm not bad-looking for my age. I may not be swimming in the stuff, but I'm not a pauper. If I didn't have so many kids to look after, I'd certainly be counted among the comfortable. I work hard. You can't fault me there. I'm one of the hottest brains around. I'm romantic. I'm still young and virile. Ours will be a perfect union. I'll send you poems and flowers three times a day, to beat the performance of your late fianc\u00c3\u00a9. I dress well and I talk posh when the occasion demands.\"\u009d \"What else, Shola? Go on! Sell yourself.\"\u009d \"Oh, there's hope I could be considered, and my marriage proposal accepted?\"\u009d \"You could be considered, with all those marks you awarded yourself.\"\u009d \"Are you serious? This is going to make my day. I leave my house a single man and return, an engaged man. Whoopee!\"\u009d \"One point, though, Shola dear. I have this understanding with Seb that I'll marry only the man he approves off.\"\u009d \"Why? He's not your father.\"\u009d \"He isn't, but he's my very first love, and that was when I was a teenager.\"\u009d \"Hm, so, I'm returning home a single man as usual, after all.\"\u009d \"You may not. I suggest you pick up your phone and tell Seb that you want his permission to marry me. If he agrees, then you can go straightaway to order your wedding suits, and outfits for a honeymoon in Acapulco. I learnt the weather there is conducive right now.\"\u009d \"I knew this wouldn't amount to anything. I've been rejected by you yet again. Are you counting the number of times I've proposed marriage to you, Treena dear, and you've flung it back at my face?\"\u009d \"Well, I haven't since I'm not an accountant. Why don't you want to ask Seb? The Shola I know is not a coward. He'd stick out his chest and go for it. Go on! Ring Seb.\"\u009d \"I won't waste my credit on that. Even if by the stretch of the imagination I'm able to get the words out of my mouth, Seb would hush me down straight away and tell me to keep off you. What's more, he may begin to count me among his enemies. So, let's forget that I proposed to you today, shall we?\"\u009d \"If you say so. Shall we get on with the job then?\"\u009d \"I was working while we were discussing marriage proposals. I'm being paid for this job, and my time is precious. I'm almost through with what I have to do here today. Rose will join my team of debt-collectors right away. You won't have to pay her extra for that as she would be doing her normal job here.\"\u009d \"I was considering her for a sack so that she won't be a distraction to your duties here.\"\u009d \"Why should she be?\u00c2 She's old stuff as I said earlier, my dear.\u00c2 If I wanted to pass that way, I would have done that many years ago when she was still quite young and appealing. I'm not saying she's faded, or fading, what I'm saying is that she can sit here on my lap and I won't feel a thing. I've never been attracted to her. It could be because several friends of mine have dated her and they didn't find her so hot; not as hot as her beautiful exterior. At least, that was what they told me afterwards. It\u00c2 may not be true. Also, her younger sister was a girlfriend at a time. When she got pregnant, I was delighted and I toyed with the idea of marrying her as she requested, but an informer told me she was sleeping with several other men, alongside me.\u00c2 I investigated, it was true; so, I rejected the pregnancy. One of the other men accepted it and\u00c2 married her, but I learnt the union later hit the boulders.\"\u009d \"Oh my God! Shola, your body must be old and tired. You've certainly slept around.\"\u009d \"I haven't. I'm as fresh as ever. Men don't get worn out. Now, my dear, let your heart be at rest concerning Rose. She's the best here at the job of debt-collection, and I've used her privately on a few occasions. I paid her well for her services. Solo, she may not be able to do much, but with my team, good results will be achieved. Let her stay.\"\u009d \"I'll have to.\u00c2 So, where do we start?\"\u009d \"I've already given Rose her duties. She will need some money for field assignments. I've discussed that with the Chief Accountant, who happens to be her boyfriend. That man is a caution! You know he used to be with us at CLAWS. He turned his office into a bedroom. I had to give him the boot. Mind you, he's brilliant. He was uneasy when he learnt I was coming here to do some work. I assured him, I won't put sand in his garri.\u00c2 He seems to enjoy working for Seb.\"\u009d \"There's no couch in his office here, so, he must be taking his girls elsewhere. Also, the GM is next door to him, so, he won't be able to try anything funny in there. Not that that bothers me. But Shola, aren't you both in this same trade?\"\u009d \"You mean it's a case of a kettle calling a pot black?\u00c2 Er, you may have a point there, but his addiction for skirts is much worse than mine. I'm a good boy.\"\u009d Do you believe that?\u00c2 I don't. Tara. Related",

        "author": "Kunle Oyatomi",
        "text": "By Kunle Oyatomi Over 100 million Nigerians are currently held hostage by a few people who want us to believe that President Yar'Adua is conscious, fit and sound to rule. And they have the audacity to insult our collective intelligence by saying that no law prevents the president from ruling in absentia!! And sadly enough, for 75 days on they have succeeded in hijacking presidential power, and kept it in\u00c2 the cooler in order to take advantage of the vacuum. As this dastardly political terrorism unfolds, we are playing with the blame game, trying to locate the problem on President Yar'Adua's court. I am afraid, that is chasing shadows. At least we now know that the ailing president was rushed out of this country practically unconscious or virtually helpless, and so was probably not in a position to be in full grasp of himself. And nobody in Nigeria today can say categorically how the president looks like or give a credible account of his state of health. The only people who know for sure what is happening are Turai (the wife) and \u2026 (the chief of staff). And these people have been not just silent, but also out of sight. Apart from the BBC stunt, we do not know a thing about our President beyond the banal resolution of the Federal Executive Council which said the president is capable of performing his duties. On yes, no law obligates that FEC to prove to us that Yar'Adua is fit to rule, so, as demanded by the court, they have done what the constitution asked them to do \u2013 pass a banal resolution that is totally false, because unsubstantiated, that the president is in \"perfect health\"\u009d. So, end of story, and the pillage of the country is accelerated beyond whatever this country has ever experienced. Now, how do we know that President Yar'Adua is in a state of mind stable enough to make critical decisions about governing a country in crisis like Nigeria? At least we can make very intelligent guess that the only reason Yar'Adua has not come out to respond to the outcry against his absenteeism could be that he is incapable of responding \u2013 the man is in a terrible battle for his life, and that is all that matters right now. If for any reason the world would\u00c2 want to think of Nigerians as docile people too dumb to reason quickly, isn't 75 days enough to tell us that Yar'Adua's absence from his duty post is because he is incapable of performing his duties? For God's sake let the likes of Andoaaka and Taminu credit us with some intelligence. Yar'Adua cannot be fit to rule, and for 75 day prefer to lie down on a Saudi hospital bed wasting public funds to treat himself of a mild indisposition that a\u00c2 roadside chemist in Nigeria can treat. That would be criminal of the man. But for all that we know of him, our ailing president is not a criminal, like those who are telling damnable lies about his health. We know that something serious is happening to our President to keep him back in a Saudi hospital this long. Without a doubt he is INCAPABLE of performing his function at the presidency. Thus it is most uncharitable for us to locate the blame for our crisis on the President. He could be to all intent and purposes unaware of the state of the nation as a result of his ill-health-absolutely unaware despite his BBC interview. Who then shall we hold accountable for the festering crisis that we now have\u00c2 on our hands? The chief architects of this situation are the Attorney General of the Federation Mr Andoaaka, and his\u00c2 Foreign Affairs counterpart, Ojo Maduekwe, the economic adviser to the President Mr Taminu, and the entire cabinet in the Federal Executive Council. They are the ones holding Nigeria to ransom, using the court process to manipulate the constitution of the Federal Republic. But for Dora Akunyili, the only voice in the din who at the meeting of Ministers last Wednesday decided to follow the path of honour. Anyone who knows Akunyili will testify that the woman does not have the liver to live a lie. She told her colleagues to say it loud and clear that Yar'Adua is not fit to still rule. The most tragic aspect of this crisis is that the whole lot of them are not elected by the Nigerian people and\u00c2 so they will be considering themselves unaccountable to Nigerians except Mr President who appointed them. And by extension, perhaps, they cannot be trusted to act in the national interest, except the president asks them so to do!! There are the characters that are holding us hostage in the name of Mr President. In a situation like this, who can we depend on to save the nation from the catastrophic consequence of imminent collapse that stares us in the face. My humble submission is this, after the President, on whose table the buck stops, the next group of people or institution that can come to the rescue are members of the National Assembly. They are the peoples' representatives, and they, (not the FEC), are responsible to the Nigerian citizens for good governance and ensuring that the rule of law\u00c2 prevails. So if governance is in crisis today, the National Assembly, not the FEC should be held accountable especially so because in this particular case, they occupy the highest seat of the moral conscience of this country. But so far they have broken faith with public trust, and still have not reached a consensus as to what to do in the public interest. Yar'Adua is not the problem. The man is too enfeebled by ill-health to be in charge; and those whose responsibility it is to secure governance are as disabled as Mr President himself.\u00c2 That is our dilemma. Until the National Assembly wakes up or is cured of its (is it terminal?) slumber, we are racing ever faster to disaster. Time is running out!! Related",

        "text": "\u2013 the funloving, but hardworking single parent By Treena Kwenta Hi readers! Sometimes I'm glad I'm not into a second marriage. No kidding, and no bad belle! As regular readers of this page know, of all the gals, only Becky in still in the same marriage contracted long ago, and is still thriving. Mind you, it rocked seriously several times, but it steadied when her husband discovered God and decided to remain on God's side. We all heaved a sigh of relief when he became born-again. Our relief was because we didn't want it to seem that our group was made up\u00c2 of ladies with broken homes. That's not a good image,\u00c2 no matter how emancipated and 'with it' we are. Boma didn't have a broken home, her beloved FD passed on of a sudden illness when he was in his\u00c2 mid thirties. Luckily, she met another good man who happened to be a widower, and they're happy together. Liz thought her 'made in heaven' marriage was for a life time, but sadly, it ended in divorce. Again, luckily, she found love\u00c2 in Uka, a divorced man, and they're happy together. Tayo and I met our spouses while we were teenagers in Britain. We married them, returned home, and the happy and loving marriages we had, shattered, ending in divorce. Tayo could have got married if she wanted, but as she made money and acquired lots of property, it became difficult for her to know who loved her for herself, and who wanted her because of her wealth. Poor lady! Treena didn't have that problem. I've always lived strictly on my earnings, and Seb supported me and our children with a generous allowance, so, I live a passably comfortable life. I don't have the surplus, or property that can become a snare in my life.\u00c2 No extra money to attract men. I did fall in love with one of the most loving and romantic men in the world, but the old dear couldn't pluck up the courage to tie the knot with me, so, we remained engaged till he passed on. His demise killed any passion I might have for re-marrying or even for a romantic relationship, so, I'm occupied with other interesting things, like keeping this column for you, my appreciated readers. I said I'm glad I'm not into a second marriage because of what Liz is going through at the moment. Her husband, Uka, has two sons and one daughter, and Liz has four children for her first husband. Together, they don't have any issue. Now,\u00c2 Uka's daughter is getting married here in Lagos, and turbulence is brewing. His first wife, the mother of all his children, is saying that she won't attend if Liz is a part of any of the ceremonies. Relationship between her and Liz hasn't been cosy, understandably, even though Liz wasn't the reason her marriage broke up. In fact, before Liz, Uka had been briefly married to a Ghanaian lady when he was on secondment to his company's branch in Accra. They had a son who died, and when it was time to return to Nigeria, the lady refused to come here with him. She told him she didn't like the way his relatives who visited him in Ghana, treated her as a non-issue in the home, and she was sure they would behave worse if she were to come live in Lagos. Sadly, he had to return alone. Later, he got served divorce papers and the marriage was over. Liz came into his life several years afterwards. But the way his first wife who also went on to have another failed marriage behaves, you'd think that he had committed adultery with Liz while still in their marriage.\u00c2 The gals advised Liz to keep cool since the woman resides in her hometown in Asaba most of the time, and it was obvious her resentment is because Uka loves her (Liz) very much. She heeded the advice and concentrated on her home. The 'Introduction' of this Uka's first daughter was done at the couple's house in Dolphin Estate last year. As usual, the gals were supportive and we all attended, taking coolers of food and drinks to support our friend. It was a shock to us when Tayo and I discovered that Uka's first wife had been one of our primary school classmates here in Lagos. It was Tayo who recognized her. She went over to confirm this, and came to tell me. I looked and it was indeed the Clarissa we had known. I went over for a chat with her and she responded well. The three of us went outside to go down memory lane. It was laughs all through as we remembered our teachers, fellow pupils, etc. Coolness developed later when it was time to introduce family members and friends present, and Uka proudly introduced the gals, who he referred to as\u00c2 'The 5 Muscateers', a group to which 'the gem in my crown, Liz, belongs'. As he was saying this, he pulled Liz to himself and hugged her. Wrong move, if you ask me, since Liz wasn't the mother of the bride, and little attention should be given her at the occasion. But then, you know how ex-husbands or ex-wives can behave when they want to make their exes uncomfortable; maybe to repay them for a past hurt or so. Even though Uka is a well-bred, decent and polite person, I suppose he wasn't above such er, sorry, pettiness. You can imagine the effect on Clarissa.\u00c2 Her countenance changed at once with anger, and for the rest of the time, she ignored Tayo and me completely, not bothering to mention to the gathering, that to her delight, her childhood school mates were present, even though on the other side, Tayo and I were disappointed.\u00c2 In her shoes, we would have proudly taken recognition of our ex-school mate. When the ceremony was over, I was outraged when Tayo suggested we should go over and say 'goodbye' to her. \"Tayo dear, you're on your own there,\"\u009d I told her promptly. \"Didn't you notice how she was eyeing us with resentment throughout? That's apart from failing to announce us as her ex school mates. You want to give her an opportunity to rubbish us in front of all these people? No, thank you.\"\u009d \"Come on, Treena, be a sport. This is a classmate we haven't seen since our childhood days. How many times do you have the opportunity to come across such people? Let's go over like the enlightened ladies you and I are, and bid her 'goodbye'.\"\u009d \"Why not let her come over and bid us 'goodbye'?\"\u009d I asked. \"Let her show us that she cares.\"\u009d \"We're the hostesses, along with our friend, Liz, who's the madam of this house.\u00c2 You can't fall down and die if she eyes us again. Look, she's going to her car. Let's go.\"\u009d Reluctantly, I followed Tayo outside. Luckily, she had got into her car, and the driver was pulling away when we came to the road.\u00c2 As they drove past us, Tayo smiled and attempted a wave, but Clarissa only glared at us and didn't respond. \"At least, we behaved like civilized ladies,\"\u009d Tayo said, as we went back into the house to help Liz serve the other guests. With that incident at the Introduction, I wasn't surprised to hear that Clarissa didn't want Liz to be a part of her daughter's wedding. After that public display of affection that Uka put up at the Introduction, it's normal that she didn't want a repeat performance at the traditional wedding and the white wedding. Both are to take place here in Lagos as Uka didn't want to subject his friends and in-laws to the inconvenience of\u00c2 travelling on bad roads all the way from here to his village in Delta State. Naturally, Uka wants his Liz to be part of the ceremonies, just as he gave Liz support when her daughter got married. Liz's ex-husband ignores him totally when they meet, but at least he didn't ban him from the venues of the ceremonies. His own current wife sat behind him, while Uka sat behind Liz at both events. He and Liz had to sit together and present a united front there as parents of the bride. It would be very odd indeed if Liz were absent at Uka's own daughter's wedding. When Liz discussed Clarissa's threat with the gals, we told her that in the interest of peace, she should keep away. \"That was what I told Uka,\"\u009d she said, \"but he was furious that I should even consider such a thing. In fact, he felt insulted. He asked how his wife can be absent from his daughter's wedding. Wouldn't people think that there's no harmony in his home? Oh, I don't know.\"\u009d \"Poor you!\"\u009d said Becky. \"I understand Uka's point, but what if Clarissa decides to humiliate you at the events by coming to ask you to leave the venue? That would be terrible.\"\u009d \"So, that means that those two gorgeous outfits we have taken for the two events would be wasted,\"\u009d was my own contribution to the discussion. Tayo, Becky and Boma, all descended heavily on me, saying that all I can think of is going to dazzle people with the latest outfits, instead of being sympathetic about our friend's plight. I quickly apologized to Liz. \"Oh forget it, Treena dear,\"\u009d she said. \"I would probably think along those lines too, even if I don't say it aloud. Another thing is that Nkechi, who's very good friends with my daughter would be upset if I don't attend.\"\u009d \"Who's Nkechi?\"\u009d asked Boma. \"Uka's daughter. The bride. You remember that all his kids lived with us while their mother was abroad in her second failed marriage.\u00c2 We all had a passably good relationship then.\"\u009d \"Really? Then you must be at the weddings. We'll come along and support you,\"\u009d said Tayo. You should see the smile and relief on my face. Now, we can go knock people out with our classy and expensive outfits. Tara. Related",

        "author": "Henry Boyo",
        "text": "By Henry Boyo \u201cThe report of the 14 Nigerian banks which were appointed as Asset Managers of Nigeria\u2019s reserves was carried on the back page of The Guardian Newspaper of the 5th of October 2006. The report confirmed that \u201calready deposits worth $7bn representing part of the Central Bank of Nigeria\u2019s share of foreign reserves estimated at about $38bn had been released to the consortium of bankers\u201d, according to CBN\u2019s Head of Corporate Affairs, Mr. Festus Odoko. \u201cIn this event, CBN made good its promise to invite Nigerian banks which have consolidated a minimum $500m capital base to a \u201cforeign reserves banquet\u201d if they showed evidence of collaboration with internationally recognized financial houses. The Guardian report further confirmed that all 14 Nigerian banks are already associated with reputable affiliates, but it is not clear whether or not the M.O.U. between the parties involves joint responsibility for profits and loss, with global best banking practice and ethical standards, or if collaboration is simply formalised glorified correspondent banking! \u201cNonetheless, critics wondered if the 14 banks which had just raised their capital base under duress to N25bn could also raise additional capital of about N35bn in so short a space of time to qualify for management of CBN\u2019s reserves; conversely, the apex Bank may have quietly dropped this requirement so as to pursue its declared agenda! \u201cBut whose interest is CBN serving? The sum of $7bn is a huge sum of money in any currency and disbursement of such huge public funds should not be treated with levity. Although in the Guardian report \u201cMr. Odoko confirmed that the appointment of the 14 banks was ratified by the Investment Committee of the CBN on Tuesday, 3/10/06, the deposits worth $7bn had already been shared by Thursday morning, 5/10/06! The question is whether or not the returns from this huge investment will stimulate productivity and employment, and improve our social welfare. If not, who will benefit from this biggest ever single investment paid upfront by the Nigerian nation? Yes, you have got it, the 14 banks who will wear broad smiles to their overseas vaults! Although CBN did not declare what returns it demands from the 14 fattened beneficiaries, it is unlikely that banks will pay more than the prevailing international cost of about three per cent interest per annum for such placements! \u201cIncidentally, the 14 favoured banks are at liberty to invest anywhere in the world! Thus, while we are pleading with foreign investors to come to Nigeria to support economic and industrial development, we are simultaneously exposing our hard earned foreign exchange, for minimal gain, to a consortium of Nigerian banks which have a consolidated capital base of less than $3bn, without asking for some measure of audit control or equity participation. \u201cNigerian banks have for so long found it unattractive to invest in the real sector, particularly the income and employment generating SMEs; so, it would be foolhardy to expect that the largesse of an uncollateralised $7bn low interest loan would change their attitude to the Nigeria economy. The bizarre strategy of a minimal return of three to five per cent for a $7bn investment without an overtly declared time limit is amplified by CBN\u2019s willingness to conversely pay interest rates of between 12 and 17 per cent for monies it borrows from these same banks. \u201cNonetheless, in the event that the 14 banks are free to repatriate all or part of the $7bn back to the Nigerian capital market, it is not difficult to predict where their interests would lie: you have got it; the obvious destination would be further patronage of government\u2019s treasury bills and bonds where they can earn rates of return of up to 17 per cent from government borrowings! \u201cWorse still, moneys so collected for sale of government bills and bonds are regrettably just kept idle in CBN vaults. \u201cMr. Odoko, the CBN mouthpiece had also claimed in the Guardian report quoted above that \u201cthe $7bn represents the apex bank\u2019s share of the foreign reserves!\u2019 I beg your pardon! Apart from the very lucrative business of changing naira for federally allocated dollars, what work did the CBN do to earn $7bn? The Constitution does not distinguish a share of dollar reserves, especially for the CBN; our crude oil earnings belong to the Nigerian people as constituted by the three tiers of government; the Senate and the House of Representatives would have defaulted in their constitutional duties if CBN is not invited to defend why $7bn of our reserves should be \u2018given\u2019 to 14 banks without oversight approval!\u201d The preceding is a summary of the above article, which was first published on the 9th October 2006 in the Vanguard Newspaper. Not surprisingly, less than two years after Prof. Chukwuma Soludo\u2019s lauded banking consolidation and assurances, most Nigerian banks tittered on the verge of collapse. There has never been any confirmation that the 14 banks repaid the $7bn \u201csoft loan\u201d granted by CBN before the 2008 banking crisis; consequently, it is possible that Nigeria\u2019s $7bn reserves may have ultimately \u2018gone with the wind\u2019 during the ensuing financial meltdown! Nonetheless, such probable default did not stop the banking sector from receiving additional largesse in excess of N5tn ($30bn) from lifelines from CBN and its surrogate, the Assets Management Corporation of Nigeria\u2019s interventions, less than three years thereafter, between 2009 and 2010! CBN\u2019s misguided generosity notwithstanding, the banking sector has remained resistant to providing the real sector with loanable funds at affordable rates to stimulate industrial rejuvenation, economic growth and increasing employment opportunities. If anything, the CBN\u2019s self-styled \u201cown reserves\u201d increased well beyond $40bn to fund CBN\u2019s sporadic multi-pronged cash interventions to various subsectors; paradoxically, in spite of a still comatose real sector, the banking sector has since bounced back with bountiful profit postings, while unemployment, oppressive mass poverty and increasing national debt persist! In the above event, it may be necessary for the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission to take a closer look at the circumstances and the ultimate fate of CBN\u2019s extraordinary loan of $7bn to the banks in 2006; Nigerians surely have a right to know. After all, if the CBN made the $7bn largesse to banks, a widely reported media affair, one should, indeed expect that successful application and liquidation of this soft loan should even be heralded by a much more \u2018in your face\u2019 media blitz to assure Nigerians of the wisdom of such intervention in the first place.

The question however, is who will benefit from this huge upfront payment for yet unfulfilled promises to grow our economy? Yes, you have got it, the 14 banks who will wear broad smiles to their overseas partners\u2019 vaults, since the related cost of funds, if any, may not exceed the usually very modest prevailing international 3% annual interest for such placements! \u201cIncidentally, the 14 favoured banks are not constrained to restrict application of the $7bn to address our domestic infrastructural deficit, and are therefore at liberty to invest internationally! Curiously, therefore, while we are pleading for foreign exchange inflow for investment from foreigners, we are also inexplicably simultaneously exposing our precious $7billion, for minimal or nil return, to a consortium of Nigerian banks which have a consolidated capital base of less than $3billion, without demanding some measure of collateral, audit control or equity participation. Curiously, the tenure and other details of the M.O.U regarding this transfer of our vital assets are yet to be made public. It would be foolhardy to expect that the largesse of an uncollateralised $7bn deposit and low interest advance would change the attitude of banks to supporting real sector investments especially the SMEs. The bizarre strategy of a minimal return of say 3% on a $7bn \u201cplacement/investment\u201d is clearly amplified by CBN\u2019s willingness to simultaneously conversely pay between 12 and 17% interest on funds it borrows from these same banks! \u201cNonetheless, even if the 14 banks are also free to repatriate all or part of the $7bn back to the Nigerian capital market, it is not difficult to predict where their interests would lie: yes; the obvious destination would be further patronage of government\u2019s treasury bills and bonds on which they earn returns of up to 17%, even when the CBN ultimately simply sterlizes hundreds of billions of Naira of such advances from any use. \u201cOdoko, the CBN\u2019s mouthpiece had also claimed in the same Guardian report that \u201cthe $7bn represents the apex bank\u2019s share of the foreign reserves!\u2019 I beg your pardon!

Not surprisingly, less than two years after Prof. Chukwuma Soludo\u2019s \u2018celebrated\u2019 banking consolidation and confident assurances of the sector\u2019s stability, most Nigerian banks tittered on the verge of collapse.

Nonetheless, such probable default did not stop the banking sector from receiving additional largesse in excess of N5tn ($30bn) from money created by CBN and channeled through its surrogate, the Assets Management Corporation of Nigeria\u2019s interventions, between 2009 and 2010! CBN\u2019s misguided generosity notwithstanding, the banking community has remained resistant to providing SMEs access to loanable funds at affordable rates to stimulate industrial rejuvenation, economic growth and increasing employment opportunities.

Paradoxically, in spite of a still comatose real sector, the banking sector bounced back with bountiful profit postings, soon after AMCON\u2019s interventions; conversely, unexpectedly however, unemployment, oppressive mass poverty and increasing national debt became increasingly burdensome! Ironically in 2015, the banks also became prime beneficiaries of an additional N600bn bonanza interest charges which was paid by CBN for borrowing back deposits which were earlier placed with zero interest by government and Agencies in these same banks. Consequently, it may be necessary for the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission to take a closer look at the circumstances and the ultimate fate of CBN\u2019s extraordinary \u2018deposit/loan\u2019 of $7bn to 14 banks in 2006; Nigerians surely have a right to know.

Regrettably, however, despite the $7bn CBN\u2019s largesse and $36bn AMCON interventions, there are indications that the banking sub-sector is once again in trouble without having fulfilled the public expectations of powering the growth of the real sector and the creation of more jobs.

        "author": "Is\u2019haq Modibbo Kawu",
        "text": "By Is\u2019haq Modibbo Kawu IT was Lanre Idowu that first called me last week about Uncle Sam Amuka\u2019s 80th birthday, which took place over this weekend. Lanre wanted me to contribute a piece to a book of tributes to commemorate Uncle Sam\u2019s 80th birthday (I hope I have not let a cat out of the bag Lanre and if I did please forgive me!). He pointed out two things. One was that Uncle Sam was one person that was not given to celebrating his personal landmarks and secondly, he was sure that the old man (C\u2019mon did I just call him that?!), was going to be out of the country on the anniversary anyway! I have not even spoken with him to congratulate him. I tried his number I think on Sam Amuka Sunday night, and the phone rang from abroad; must be China I guessed because it seemed the language I heard was Mandarin! So for my column today, I had thought for so long about what I could write about the man that is everyone\u2019s favourite uncle in the real and most personal sense of that word and all the feelings that it can convey! What can I possibly write about Uncle Sam Amuka, that more talented people haven\u2019t written about him? There is a lot rolled up into the complex social and professional personality that we all admiringly call Uncle Sam: the engaging media professional who made a remarkable contribution to the evolution of journalism in our country as one of its iconic columnists. He was SAD SAM, who described Nigeria and presented a clear mirror for society to look at itself in the face, at a critical juncture in our history. Uncle Sam\u2019s generation was equally angry at the way our society was evolving, but given the depth and dimension of crises phenomenal today, they arguably lived in the best years of our country\u2019s evolution! Yet, what would be the lasting part of his legacy for me, is a deep-seated nobility of spirit, which was always the hallmark of great individuals. And that is the ability to recognize in others a unique talent and the next is the selflessness to assist in the flowering of that talent. In that respect, I think Uncle Sam has already secured his own legacy as one of the greatest media professionals that our country has ever produced, because all we have to do is look around us, in every corner of Nigeria and around the world, to see the various individuals that the genius and self effacing modesty of Uncle Sam have helped to find their m\u00e9tier in journalism. The outpouring of tributes to commemorate his 80th birthday, last weekend from all over Nigeria, just underlined his place in the hearts of people in our country, but more so, in our profession. Uncle Sam is genuinely loved and highly respected! In November 2013, I attended Uncle Sam\u2019s son\u2019s marriage ceremony in Lagos, and I had written a tribute to Uncle Sam in my column of November 14, 2013. The Piece was titled: \u201cUNCLE SAM AMUKA AND THE LAGOS SOCIAL SCENE: A RESPECTFUL TRIBUTE\u201d. Please permit me to quote from that piece. \u201cUncle Sam is one of the most decent human beings I have ever met and everybody else that I have spoken with about this unusually humane gentleman has confirmed my feeling. I do not want to over-eulogize the man, but you cannot come away from the man, not feeling delighted about his personality; his incredible modesty and his ability to appreciate the good in other people. He just has that charm and magnetism that inspire. My becoming a columnist for VANGUARD newspapers from May 2011 was largely as a result of his ability to draw people from all kinds of backgrounds to work with him in his newspapers. He is the quintessential Nigerian patriot at a time when many intelligent people have withdrawn into ethno-religious laagers, preaching all kinds of divisiveness and hatred\u2026\u201d \u201cBy the 1940s, Lagos had become the pre-eminent urban setting that drew everybody into a colonial and later, a post-colonial economic and social existence. It was instructive that leading newspapermen have always helped to define and enrich the Lagos social scene, and the roots of that must be located in the work of the cosmopolitan Jackson family of journalists, with the LAGOS WEEKLY RECORD, in Nineteenth Century Lagos. But from the 1940s, journalists became central in the nationalist movement: the Great Zik, Ernest Ikoli, Obafemi Awolowo, Ladoke Akintola and even Anthony Enahoro, were not only journalists but trend setters in a most socially significant manner. People like Uncle Sam Amuka, who as SAD SAM,was one of the most engaging columnists of all time, with his arched bowler hat, drank in the same fount and also burnt his own unique imprimatur on that remarkably vibrant Lagos social scene\u201d. Uncle Sam Amuka has been given the gift of a long life and it is a life that he has continued to live actively, retaining tremendous goodwill from people all over Nigeria. And because he has remained an outstanding professional he can tap into a wealth of experience to assist the continued evolution of our profession as well as impact in his subtle and self effacing manner, on the political development of Nigeria, as we saw in the processes that helped to diffuse tension in the lead to and the aftermath, of the 2015 General Elections. I find it equally remarkable, that Uncle Sam has a stubborn determination to keep pace with the technological and technical advances that affect the profession as well as our social lives. He carries the most recent gadgets that help him keep track of music, which I noticed is one of his passions. And there is also that sarcastic laughter and ability to look at issues with a forensic mind. But what no one can miss is the genuine respect and affection that he has for people with talent! In that sense, it is indicative not only of his large heart but the near absence of insecurity about the talents that other people possess (The worst thing that can happen to a talented person is to work with an insecure boss!). In Uncle Sam Amuka, Nigeria can always be proud of a remarkable professional who has made a genuine mark on our national life and a very decent man, who we all genuinely see as a favourite uncle! Uncle Sam Amuka, on the occasion of your 80th birthday, thank you very much, for enriching our lives! Tolu Fatoyinbo and Jimmy Atte: Icons from an era of excellence IT was on Monday this week that I read of the passing of Jimmy Atte, the former Executive Director Programmes at NTA, who was also one of the pioneers of NTA in Ilorin. Just before I commenced writing my column this week, I called Femi Ibrahim of NTA News in Abuja, to confirm the news of Oga Jimmy Atte\u2019s death. He affirmed that it was true. I had earlier decided to write a tribute this week to ToluFatoyinbo, the ace sports commentator, who was recently buried and to whom Kayode Soyinka and Fabio Olanipekun had written very sympathetic tributes, in the wake of his death. In 1985, the National Sports Festival held in Ilorin. Tagged \u201cKWARA 85\u201d, Radio Kwara was the fulcrum of the live broadcast of the games. And as we were preparing for the live broadcast of the opening ceremony, there entered ToluFatoyinbo! He was fresh from providing live commentaries for Nigeria\u2019s Golden Eaglets, who had taken the world by storm at the Under-17 World Championship, I think in China. He was the ultimate showman and while we had a rough introduction at the beginning, we would later work together as commentators, newsreaders and reporters during the festival, with ToluFatoyinboand the late Sebastian Ofurum, being the senior partners in our broadcasts. We retained a friendship and an affectionate respect into the future. ToluFatoyinbo belonged to a distinguished cast of sports commentators that were trained in the rigorously professional traditions of Radio Nigeria, in those good old days. He was as brilliant as he was meticulous in the preparations that went into his work as a commentator and it was a hallmark of the work of the masters: from Ishola Folorunsho through to Earnest Okonkwo and Sebastian Offurum, Kevin Ejiofor to ToluFatoyinbo, that they brought the events they covered into the homes of millions of Nigerians as they used words to paint pictures vividly for their listeners. For a long time, even when television began to provide live telecasts of football games, Nigerians would watch the events on their television sets but listen to the radio commentaries as accompaniment. With ToluFatoyinbo\u2019s death, we lost one of the last great names and voices from a distinguished cast that made our lives so much better because of the way they touched our lives. Similarly, with Jimmy Atte\u2019s death, we also lost one of the greatest practitioners of television programming that Nigeria ever produced. I think one of Atte\u2019s greatest abilities was to see and nurture other people\u2019s talents. I became a very famous Deejay on radio in Ilorin by the 1980s. After my shows, Jimmy Atte was one of those who would regularly call me to express appreciation of my ability. I knew he worked at NTA Ilorin, but we had never met, until one fine morning when he called as was his wont, but that day, he invited me to meet him at his office. When I got there, he informed me that he had been thinking over a couple of months on how he could create a television programme around my ability as a radio deejay. He had finally worked out the idea and had invited me to work with him. I was pleasantly surprised and over the next couple of weeks, I went back and forth as we gave life to an outline of an idea that became a programme that I presented and was centred around music and musicians on NTA Ilorin. That was the quintessential Jimmy Atte, whom I still think was the best DG NTA NEVER had and it was a great pity that the politics of television broadcasting did not allow him to reach the peak, that he so eminently deserved. But that did not dim his esteem as one of the greatest heroes of Nigerian television broadcasting! With Jimmy Atte\u2019s death this week, we have certainly lost a genuine Nigerian patriot who loved his job passionately as an expression of the love he has for his country. May God give the families and colleagues of ToluFatoyinbo and Jimmy Atte, the fortitude to bear their passing! Related",

        "author": "Eric Teniola",
        "text": "By Eric Teniola A FEW hours before General Yakubu Gowon, who was away in Kampala, was toppled from power on July 29 ,1975 one of the coup plotters, Col. Ibrahim Taiwo, who later became the Military Governor of Kwara state, approached Brigadier Theophilus Yakubu Danjuma, the General Officer 3rd Division of the Nigerian Army in Jos in his house in the Plateau state capital. \u201dSir, we have decided to take over the Government\u201d. \u201cSir, we don\u2019t want you to do anything but we do not want you to go against us because we are sure that the moment it is announced that you are not with us there will be trouble\u201d. Gen. Danjuma\u2019s reply was\u201dMake sure there is no bloodshed. Let me make this clear, I will do nothing to stop you, but I will not join you\u201d. Even as at that time, General Danjuma was a man one could not ignore in the scheme of things. Till today, those in authority either in government, religion or business still can\u2019t ignore him.? Only few Generals in this country command our National attention like Gen. Theophilus Yakubu Danjuma. When he talks people listen and take him seriously. He has been a participant and a key player on major decisions that have affected this nation. He still commands respect and a lot of people still believe him. On Saturday December 9, he will celebrate his 80th birthday in Lagos. I am sure all his faithful will celebrate with him. After the assassination of Gen. Murtala Mohammed on that Friday February 13, 1976, if Gen. Yakubu Danjuma had wanted to be the Head of State and Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces, he would have been. And that would have changed the course of history. He was then the Chief of Army Staff. In a rare interview on February 17, 2008, which he granted, Mr. Akpo Esajere, he said: \u201cThen, Murtala was killed. I think it is public knowledge that Obasanjo fled on the day Murtala Muhammed was killed. He remained in hiding until the coup was aborted and he reached out, first, to M.D Yusuf (Inspector-General of Police) who then called him and he came out of hiding, and joined us in Dodan Barracks. We discussed the funeral of Muhammed and made arrangement as to who would accompany his remains to Kano, so on and so forth. At the end of the meeting, Obasanjo asked M.D Yusuf and I to stay with him in the chambers (Dodan Barracks). After everybody had left Obasanjo told M.D Yusuf and I that what had happened had destroyed his faith in the loyalty of the Nigerian Army. That he had decided that after the funeral, he would retire, leave the Army and go home. But before that he would name me as the successor to Murtala. I told him that, that amounted to desertion and that he could not run away. He was number 2, number 1 had been killed in battle, he as number 2 would take over. He said no, no, no; that he didn\u2019t think he should stay; that he wanted to go. We argued that. In the end, Yusuf said, \u201clook, let\u2019s all sleep over this matter; tomorrow we will decide\u201d. I said, \u201clook, there\u2019s no question of sleeping over it; the point now is we should be looking for who is going to take Obasanjo\u2019s seat as number 2 because there is no way we are going to allow him to chicken out and leave at this time; we must all stay and face the future together.\u201d So, we left and I went home. By this time, we had called all the members of the Supreme Military Council to Lagos. The following day, he (Obasanjo) started to talk in the same vein and I cut in. I said that Obasanjo could not leave; he had to stay and be the Head of State and we should be looking for the number 2 man. I had over night considered the consequences of what had happened and came to the conclusion that if we were not careful; we would end up with a religious conflict on our hands. Already, that evening \u2013 the evening that it became public knowledge that Murtala had been killed \u2013 Dimka had made a broadcast in which he said, \u201cgood tidings\u201d among other things. He had imposed a curfew \u2013 from dawn to dusk (laugh) and said all sorts of things using the expression, \u201cgood tiding.\u201d Abubakar Gumi in the North said that the coup that killed Murtala was a Christian coup because of the utterances of the coup leader, who said, \u201cgood tidings\u201d because it is an expression of Christians.. Already, there was tension in the North. The governor of Kaduna State, an airforce officer, Usman, had to contain him: that it had nothing to do with Christians, that it was a purely military affair. I knew that if we were not careful, as time went on, we should be consumed by religious strife in the country. I decided that the new Chief of Staff must come from the North preferably, a Hausa/Fulani man. From my knowledge, I had two candidates \u2013 (Muhammadu) Buhari, who was really my number one candidate for that post and the late Shehu Yar\u2019Adua. Shehu was not in the country; he was abroad as Minister of Transport. You would remember we had inherited a cement armada in the Lagos and Port Harcourt (ports) and his (Shehu\u2019s) first assignment was to decongest the Lagos port and get rid of all the vessels that were clogging Nigerian waters, and attracting huge demurrages from our government.. He (Shehu) was abroad attending to that problem when Dimka struck. So, they were the two candidates. Buhari, at that time, and even today, is one of the most upright Army officers that the Nigerian Army has produced \u2013 very clean, a very strict officer. Unfortunately for him, he served under me for a short time in Port Harcourt and I observed that he was a very inflexible person. I reasoned that Buhari any day could be a first class Chief of Army Staff. Why waste him in a political post? Why shorten his career because if he became Chief of Staff, he would have to leave at the end of the tenure. Why waste him there? Besides, I observed that he was too rigid, he was too inflexible to hold a political post. If you are in politics, you must be flexible; you must compromise from time to time. In politics, they call it pragmatism. But in the military, if you are pragmatic, it is regarded as a weakness. I said no, not Buhari. Shehu, I didn\u2019t know him well except that I knew that, of all the officers of his rank, he was the most politicised. So, sending a politicised Army Officer to a political post, I thought, was a good thing. That was how I named Shehu the next Chief of Staff. When we came to the Supreme Military Council and Obasanjo started singing the same tune that he had sung to me and M.D Yusuf the previous night, I said no, that was not the issue; he was the most senior person and he had to stay there. He had to stay in office. He made some feeble resistance but I think he had slept over our discussion and concluded that if we insisted, he would stay. There were a few voices of dissent. The first came from the Chief of Air Staff, Isa Doko, who said that the problem we were facing was an Army problem and that the Army boys had confidence in me. That we had just crushed an attempted coup, and we should not put somebody there that the Army didn\u2019t have confidence in. A few other officers supported him but I overruled them. And so, I imposed Obasanjo on my colleagues in the Supreme Military Council.\u201d Related",

        "author": "None",
        "text": "It\u2019s been ten years since the AlQaeda terrorist attack on the United States of America. The attack which was executed with an eye for maximum devastation took place on September 11, 2001, hence the reference to 9/11, the shorthand formula by which it is now generally known. It was by all accounts the worst terrorist attack on US soil, taking nearly 3000 souls and bringing down the 110-floor twin towers of the World Trade Centre, iconic symbol of American capitalism. The attackers, armed merely with knives with which they hijacked the civilian planes they crashed into the WTC also went for the Pentagon, symbol of America\u2019s military power after entering a section of the protected airspace that covers both the White House and the Pentagon. At a point, President George W. Bush, his wife Laura and their dog had to be evacuated into the fortified bunker in the White House when it appeared the terrorist were about to attack the White House. It was the second time the President had to be spirited into a bunker, the first time was in Florida when news first broke that America was under attack and nobody knew what was going on. But in the midst of the confusion, the people rallied and braced up to respond to the attacks during which four civilian planes were crashed by hijackers with one of them hitting the Pentagon exactly 60 years from the day the foundation of the sprawling military complex was laid. The attackers were nothing if not extremely daring. They were not merely out to send a message but to show they could back every threat with action, striking at symbolic structures of the American society. The scale of the attack beggars belief. Which was why the Americans didn\u2019t know how to respond in the first few hours. Nobody could imagine terrorists striking the very symbols of American military and economic power and in the process short-circuiting her technological might in the manner the terrorists did. Americans could not imagine this as I couldn\u2019t when my younger brother first told me of the attack. In those 10 years, a lot has happened to alter the political configuration of the world, especially with regards to Middle East politics and the Persian Gulf. The removal and eventual execution of Saddam Hussein in Iraq, the Taliban in Afghanistan and the rendition of terrorist suspects all culminating with the May Day killing of Osama Bin Ladin are fallout of the 9/11 attack. The NATO-aided fall of Muammar Gaddafi in the aftermath of the Arab Spring is not unconnected with the whole drama that started with 9/11. Although Gaddafi had been a real bugaboo for the Americans long before 9/11, he would learn to moderate his comments and action after he realised the West, especially the Americans, was out to take its pound of flesh following 9/11. He played into their hands with his heavy-handed response to the Arab Spring protests that began last February. In the last one week Americans have been remembering the events of 9/11, the crushing pain it inflicted on many and how the people were able to rise with one voice to respond to the Al Qaeda threat. One constant refrain in all the accounts of the events is the crucial factor of leadership in American response. From the President to the governor, the mayor to the congress, fire fighters and ordinary Americans on the street, the role of an effective and able leadership cannot be discountenanced in cutting back the initial victory borne by the surprise terrorist attacks. President Bush was out of Washington when the attackers went into action. Immediately it was apparent that America was under attack and nobody knew the details of the attack and who was behind it, the President was moved by the secret service into a bunker in a military base from where he was to receive briefing and coordinate response to the attack. He would later insist on returning to the White House as he didn\u2019t find the image of an American president operating from inside a bunker in the heartland of America, away from Washington, the nation\u2019s capital, fitting symbol of leadership. The psychological victory that would give the terrorist couldn\u2019t be quantified. He returned to take effective charge. But within the first 24 hours or thereabout, the face of American leadership beamed around the world was that of Rudy Giuliani, the Mayor of New York, equivalent of a local government chairman in Nigeria, who had been summoned from a morning breakfast with the initial report that a light plane had crashed into the WTC. When the South Tower came under attack 17 minutes after the first and it became clear what was afoot was a terrorist attack, Giuliani took effective charge even as his attempts to reach the governor and White House failed. He went into the streets and rallied New Yorkers, acting the part of a true leader. He went on air even in his dust-covered clothes to calm Americans and assure them that their leaders were taking necessary steps to protect American lives. In all this he received devastating reports and saw with his own eyes how people jumped to their death from floors high up the towers. He moved around and calmed nerves. His action received the right response from the people who began to take steps to minimise the scale of the attack, rescuing trapped victims and providing round-the-clock care for the injured. Threadbare rhetoric It was not the time for threadbare rhetoric. Hundreds of kilometres away, the President who was in a school would get report on live television of what was going on in New York. Contrary to the image of the bungling politician projected in the media, Bush was presidential in his response even as he called off the school meeting immediately, leaving with his aides, not a moment betraying any sign of anxiety. The Boko Haram attacks, as are attacks in other parts of Nigeria, are nothing compared to what Americans experienced on 9/11. But the response the Nigerian case called and still calls for are not dissimilar from that provided by Mayor Giuliani or President Bush in 2001- effective leadership. This has been lacking in Nigeria. President Jonathan has at best been tentative and lacking in decision. There are certain qualities of leadership a potential president ought to possess. Such qualities of fast, decisive action and ability to think on the feet, not waiting until an entire cabinet is convened, appear lacking in Jonathan\u2019s action. This is one point the President as are some who are blindly supportive of him would do well to reckon with if he must be a leader and not a mere politician. Related",

        "title": "On Damascus road (1) by Femi Aribisala",
        "author": "Femi Aribisala",
        "text": "By Femi Aribisala As he journeyed he came near Damascus, suddenly a light shone around him from heaven. Then he fell to the ground, and heard a voice. (Acts 9:3-4). My wife was coming back from a trip to the United States and I went to Murtala Mohammed International Airport, Lagos with my six-year old son to meet her. She had two major pieces of luggage. I put one in the boot and the other in the back seat of the car. It was around seven-thirty in the evening, and we set out for home. The Okota Road, Isolo Soon, a car overtook us with some people who seemed to be shouting at us for some inexplicable reason. I was lost in thought and paid little attention to them. It is commonplace in Lagos for some driver to be upset with you rightly or wrongly. But no sooner had they overtaken us than they swerved and blocked the road with their car. Immediately, some men jumped out menacingly. Armed robbers From that moment everything became surreal. Indeed, it seemed that everything went into slow motion. I could not believe the dexterity and spontaneity of my reactions. I slammed on the brakes and the car stopped. I quickly switched the car to reverse gear and pressed on the accelerator and the car moved back. Our assailants were banking on the element of surprise, but my prompt reactions upstaged them. Having quickly reversed the car, I again brought it to a stop. In front of us on the road were four armed men. I had always believed in myself. I saw myself as a self-made man and I regarded myself as a problem-solver. True, this was a rather bigger problem than I have had to deal with before. This problem seemed to be one of life and death. But it was a problem nevertheless. Therefore, unlike others who might have simply surrendered, I decided to solve the problem. I needed to make a quick decision. I had to decide whether to continue to reverse the car, which I could only do for so long; or to go forward, never minding our assailants; or to surrender, which might be fatal. James Bond I seemed to have all the time in the world to make this split-second decision. I decided to fight for my life rather than surrender to the unknown. I made up my mind to go forward at top speed to the right and try to avoid their car, which was biased to the left side of the road. I also decided that, if the man to my extreme right did not get out of the way, I would overrun him with the car. I put the car back into the first gear and went ahead to execute my plan. I slammed hard on the accelerator. The man to my extreme right literally had to jump out of the road because I aimed the car directly at him. I managed to avoid the car with which they had blocked the road and made a dash for it. I told myself if they chased me in their car they would not be able to catch me. These people did not know whom they were dealing with. But before I could begin to congratulate myself on turning the tables on our abductors, my plans went disastrously wrong. A lamppost appeared out of nowhere, and I slammed headlong into it. I have been back on that road so many times since that day and have wondered why I did not see that lamppost. But I did not. Once I hit the lamppost, I was trapped. Once I hit the lamppost, all my brilliantly executed escape plans turned out to be foolhardy. Once I hit the lamppost, I knew I was in trouble. I looked out the window to see that the man I nearly ran down had got up and was now coming towards me. I knew there could only be one thing on his mind: vengeance. Jesus, my saviour But before I could panic or be resigned to my fate, something even more dramatic happened. I heard a voice. It was not a booming voice. It was a \u201cstill small voice.\u201d It was authoritative and calm. It spoke with quiet reassurance. \u201cFemi,\u201d it said, \u201cnothing is going to happen to you here.\u201d Before I could even think about what this meant under the circumstances, the offended armed robber drew near. Again, I saw everything in slow motion. Grimacing, he pointed his gun at me and fired. I saw a flash of light and the glass at my side of the door came crashing down. Don\u2019t ask me why, but I opened the door and came out of the car. Only then did I realise I could not walk. There was something wrong with my left leg. I noticed then that the bullet must have hit me in the leg, but I never felt it enter my body. With the benefit of hindsight, I wonder what my assailant must have thought had happened. There must have been something disturbing about pointing a gun at a man from virtually point blank range and firing, and nevertheless the man you fired at calmly opened the door and came out. In this part of the world where many believe in the occult (juju or voodoo), I wonder what the man thought happened to the bullet he fired directly at me. Prince of peace I am not a brave man. I would hardly describe myself as courageous. I had, for example, a chronic fear of flying as a result of a hair-raising flight I had in the early 1980\u2019s from Lagos to Jos. And yet, I was not afraid of our assailants on Airport Road. Surprisingly, I was somewhat indifferent to the attack. I seemed to be abstracted from the entire incident, and to be like someone standing on the side lines watching an unfolding reality show. And yet. I knew, however the matter was resolved, my life would never be the same again. I now know that apart from the armed robbery, something definitely supernatural was going on. I now know that it was God who spoke and told me in effect not to worry, and that nothing was going to happen to me. I now know that when God speaks, he speaks peace. The psalmist says: \u201cI will hear what God the LORD will speak, for he will speak peace to his people and to his saints.\u201d (Psalm 85:8). When God speaks peace, peace is established. (Mark 4:39). Therefore, on that fateful night, in the middle of a deadly armed robbery attack, I experienced inexplicable peace: a peace that surpasses all understanding. (Philippians 4:7). As I came out of the car, the armed robber who had shot at me did not shoot again. I say this because he could easily have done so. I believe he knew he could not have missed me the first time, and yet I was apparently unhurt. Instead of shooting again, he came over and slapped me. \u201cWhy were you driving like that?\u201d he demanded. How else, I wonder, should one drive when accosted by armed robbers? Of course, I did not dare tell him that. \u201cPlease don\u2019t be offended,\u201d I pleaded. \u201cI was only trying to get away from you as best as I could.\u201d CONTINUED Related",

        "title": "Dapchi : Dangerous example of how to help Boko Haram",
        "author": "None",
        "text": "It\u2019s like a tale from fish-wifery told by moonlight: how Boko Haram entered a Nigerian town as villains, kidnapped dozens of schoolgirls, and 32 days later returned them to the same town as heroes with flags. A girl released by Boko Haram walks with her father (L) in Dapchi on March 21, 2018. Boko Haram Islamists who kidnapped 110 schoolgirls in Dapchi, northeast Nigeria, just over a month ago have so far returned 101 of the students to the town, the government said today. / AFP PHOTO waving and crowds cheering and not a single Nigerian soldier in sight. Amend the last part. The soldiers who were in sight were present to stop journalists but to ensure the safe passage of Abu Mus\u2019ab Al-Barnawi\u2019s men. If it were a movie, it would have been titled: \u201cFrom Shekau to Al-Barnawi: The Making Of Another Monster\u201d. Are these fellows still wanted? I\u2019m bereft. One month ago, we woke up to the news that Boko Haram had kidnapped 110 girls from their dormitory in the Government Girls Science Technical College, Dapchi. From all accounts, the incident happened under very bizarre circumstances. Even though the region remains the epicenter of Boko Haram activities, the army was withdrawn from the town and two weeks later, the terrorists struck. To say they struck, is to dramatise the incident. They came in Nigerian Army uniforms as if they had come to their playground. They came in nine trucks over miles of open, largely flat ground, released a few random shots in the air and within an hour rounded up 110 girls, while a few managed to escape. The cries for help fell on deaf ears. The police station in Dapchi was conveniently empty and multiple sources reported that the phone numbers of the Divisional Police Officer were switched off. God knows we\u2019re glad to have the girls back, and we should do all we can to help them recover from the trauma. We\u2019re deeply saddened about any of them who may have been lost or left behind, and we remember again the remaining Chibok girls. But there\u2019s a lot that the government needs to account for. We can\u2019t say Shekau and the ascendant outlaw, Abu Mus\u2019ab Al-Barnaw, are wanted men and yet continue to deal with them like the fellows next door. The only way for Dapchi not to happen again, for this whole thing not to become another criminal enterprise, is for the government to tell us exactly what happened and to adopt a different approach to this problem, instead of feeding the monsters. I have a sickening feeling that we might be heading down a slippery slope with the lives of innocent children and sending a dangerous signal that parts of Nigeria are safer under the control of terrorists. When are we going to be able to tell the terrorists that our children\u2019s lives will not be toyed with? Parents are forever My children grew up staying mostly with me. They did not go to boarding school; and even when they went away on holiday, I cannot recall them spending two or three weeks away at a stretch. At about 18 when the eldest moved into the hostel after her admission to the University in Lagos, there was hardly any weekend when I did not find an excuse to visit, often under the pretext of taking some needed provision to her. I\u2019ve found out that I\u2019m not alone. If we can help it, we, parents, want our children to be near, until it becomes inevitable to free them from the nest. After the kidnap of the Dapchi girls, I\u2019ve been thinking about that day when I left my daughter all by herself in her new school outside the country. For the first time in both of our lives, she was going to be on her own, not knowing what was going to happen to her after my departure. If I could be so deeply confused and saddened by the prospects of her safety in a largely secure place, then I wonder how the parents of the Dapchi 110 must have felt losing the apples of their eyes to murderous strangers with no idea where they were or what was happening to them. And I can imagine what joy it must be to have them back. Buhari came close to this experience in a public way, lately. In December, his son, Yusuf \u2013 his only son \u2013 was involved in a bike accident that nearly claimed his life. The country rallied round him and the First Family \u2013 which is as it should be. I still remember those pictures from the early days of the accident, when the poor chap\u2019s life was hanging by a thread at Cedacrest Hospitals, Abuja. Buhari and his wife, Aisha, visited the hospital a couple of times. On no occasion was the red carpet laid out for them like it happened during the President\u2019s visit to Dapchi. Red carpet in Dapchi When I saw photographs from that Dapchi visit, the first thing that struck me was the red carpet and Buhari\u2019s light blue three-piece agbada and a matching cap. I\u2019m not saying his heart was not heavy with grief or that he should have faked his concern by appearing in rags. But for God\u2019s sake, it was a somber visit, in some way reminiscent of his visits to Yusuf after the chap\u2019s bike accident. It was a visit to a crime scene strewn with the broken emotions of a community that is half-dead, as one resident described it. If it didn\u2019t occur to Buhari\u2019s chaperons not spread the red carpet and deck the place like a set for the Oscars, didn\u2019t the President himself think that his appearance was insensitive? It may seem an irrelevant point now, after the girls were rescued on Wednesday. Yet symbols, especially genuine and moderate symbols, can help any community going through difficult and distressing times. It didn\u2019t help matters that Buhari was comparing his response with that of former President Goodluck Jonathan in Chibok. He ought to know that no two miseries are ever alike; yet each demands our fullest empathy and nothing less. A failed template Is Dapchi the emerging template for dealing with Boko Haram? It worked for the release of over 101 Chibok girls, but even in that case, we did not see the terrorists in a triumphant procession on the streets of Chibok. Something has changed. Al-Barnawi and his men have become emboldened to the frighteningly alarming point where they can march confidently down the streets of Dapchi with crowds waving the same Boko Haram flags that gallant soldiers laid down lives to remove in many parts of Yobe, Borno and Adamawa in the last three years. This dangerous sign can only be viewed with pleasure by Al-Barnawi, other Boko Haram franchises and their accomplices for whom we\u2019re opening yet another door. It\u2019s true that Buhari said almost three years ago, that he was willing to negotiate to free the Chibok girls. But now, the handshake has reached the elbow and Dapchi may have signaled the end of our sovereignty.

        "text": "By Femi Aribisala Be careful before you sign that life-insurance policy with Jesus Christ. Read it properly because you would be signing away your life. Armed robbers attacked me on Lagos airport road and an anonymous Good Samaritan came to my rescue. I soon discovered this Good Samaritan was Jesus, someone I had previously gone to great lengths to avoid. It became imperative for me to get to know all I could about him; the better to lay hold of that for which he laid hold of me. Relentless assassin But there was a catch. Once I identified my saviour as Jesus, I was immediately thrust into an intensive spiritual warfare. I started having a recurring nightmare that nearly scared me to death. There was a mean-looking man in a hood who was out to get me. Every so often, I found myself on the run for my life from him. After running non-stop from street to street all through the night, I would wake up exhausted and out of breath; drenched in sweat. Since I always managed to elude my would-be assassin, I would wake up gasping, screaming: \u201cThank you Jesus; thank you Jesus!\u201d Until one day, I discovered the true identity of my \u201cstubborn-pursuer.\u201d The Lord himself showed me his face. I could not believe my eyes. The killer after my life was Jesus Christ, my Saviour. Ransomed life This brings to mind the experience of Moses: \u201cIt came to pass on the way, at the encampment, that the Lord met him and sought to kill him.\u201d (Exodus 4:24). I thought Jesus came to save my life from robbers, only to discover he too had his own agenda. The robbers made away with my possessions; but my saviour was determined to take something even more precious from me. He wanted to take my life. Jesus says: \u201cThe thief comes only to steal and kill and destroy; I have come that they may have life, and have it to the full.\u201d (John 10:10). That means in order to receive the life Jesus was determined to give me, I had to relinquish my life. In short order, my saviour became my adversary. I discovered Jesus, my saviour, was not interested in saving the life I lived. Instead, he was bent on jeopardizing it. Accepting his offer of salvation would mean my life was over. Therefore, I was confronted again with uncomfortable choices, similar to the ones I faced with the armed robbers. I could either fight to the last to save my life from my saviour, or I could surrender and allow my saviour to take my life. But Jesus warns: \u201cWhoever desires to save his life will lose it, but whoever loses his life for my sake will find it. For what profit is it to a man if he gains the whole world, and loses his own soul? Or what will a man give in exchange for his soul?\u201d (Matthew 16:25). Salvation from life The bible says at the pool of Bethesda, there was a man who had been sick for thirty-eight years. Jesus singled him out and asked him: \u201cDo you want to be healed?\u201d (John 5:6). I was so bothered about this question, I brought it up before the Lord in prayer: \u201cHow can you ask a man who has been sick for thirty-eight years if he would like to be healed? Surely a sick man wants to be healed.\u201d The Lord\u2019s answer gave me the shock of my life. He said: \u201cI asked him that, Femi, because sickness was his life.\u201d I was not sure I heard the Lord correctly. \u201cWhat did you say?\u201d His reply was emphatic: \u201cI said sickness was his life. He had known nothing but sickness. He did not know what it means to be well. To save him, I have to save him from his life. I have to save him from the only life he knows and that life is a life of sickness.\u201d \u201cBut how can a man be saved from his life? I thought men are saved from death.\u201d The Lord replied with a kingdom dynamic that completely transformed my life: \u201cNo Femi,\u201d he said, \u201cI save from life. That is the reason why I kill before I make alive. I kill the lives of men.\u201d When a man has to be saved from his own life there is inevitably a problem. He is confronted with death. Salvation from life requires death. Without death there can be no salvation. And so the Lord kills before he makes alive. But are we prepared to face death? Is self-preservation not a basic human instinct? It might be human but it is not divine. Jesus laid down his life, leaving us an example to follow. Choice, choices, choices Beloved, understand this and internalise it. True Christianity is a death sentence. A true Christian dies in order to live. We are delivered from counterfeit life to substantive life. But most of us are not true to the faith. We are determined to save our lives. However, we are not determined to save our lives from the theft of the devil. On the contrary, the devil is the giver of the life we live and love, although we would hardly admit it. No! We are determined to save our life from Jesus Christ; \u201cthe way, the truth, and the life.\u201d (John 14:6). The new life Jesus offered me involved working with him as a menial fisherman. But I was not interested in fisheries. As a matter of fact, I was contemptuous of fishermen. They are poorly paid and have low social status. I obtained a doctorate from Oxford University, England so I could do something better with my life. But had it not been for my Good Samaritan, I would be dead. How then could I refuse to work for him in whatever capacity he chose? What if he were to withdraw his protection? Would I not soon be at the mercy of armed-robbers again? I had to make a choice but clearly my personal agenda was not an option. I either had to risk premature death at the hand of robbers, or forgo my grandiose life-long plans and become a destitute fisherman. Buying Jesus insurance Be careful before you sign that life-insurance policy with Jesus Christ. There is a lot of fine print in it. Read it properly because you would be signing away your life. Once signed, there is no going back. After you put forward your claim, then you will be shown all sorts of clauses you were not aware of beforehand. You will need a magnifying glass to read some of them. \u201cHoly Spirit, did we really agree to this from the beginning?\u201d \u201cWell, what did you mean when you sang: \u2018Unto thee my blessed Saviour, I surrender all?\u2019\u201d What did you mean when you asked the Lord to \u201cbreak\u201d you; \u201cmould\u201d you; \u201cfill\u201d you; and \u201cuse\u201d you?\u201d Solomon gave us due warning: \u201cDo not be rash with your mouth, and let not your heart utter anything hastily before God. For God is in heaven, and you on earth; therefore let your words be few\u201d (Ecclesiastes 5:2). But often, the Holy Spirit is the one who inspires our prayers, and we just go ahead sheepishly without realising we are praying our life away. CONTINUED Related",

        "title": "Winnie Mandela: Mother of the struggle",
        "author": "Owei Lakemfa",
        "text": "By Owei Lakemfa WINNIE Nomzamo Madikizela-Mandela was a matchless fighter, an unconquerable combatant with an indomitable spirit who was not only married to the legendary Nelson Mandela, but also to the struggle of the African people. She was not just the mother who brought up the Mandela children, but was the undisputable Mother Africa. Nelson Mandela\u2019s ex-wife Winnie Mandela dies at 81 Winnie was young, but she was conscious of her historical role. When in 1963, at 27, her husband was sentenced to life, she said: \u201cWhat has happened should take none of us by surprise, for we are faced with a vicious oppressor\u2026I shall certainly live under great strain in the coming years, but this type of living has become part and parcel of my life. The greatest honour a people can pay to a man behind bars is to keep the freedom flame burning, to continue the fight.\u201d Many may not fully understand her role in the African Liberation Movement and struggle, but suffice it to state that at the height of the South African liberation struggle when the evil Apartheid system was militarily and politically backed by powerful countries like Britain and the United States; when the apostles of that soulless system routinely murdered Blacks, and seasonally invaded African countries; when it held the cream of the liberation struggle on Robben Island and its word was law that must be obeyed to the letter or be met with severe consequences, Winnie Mandela defied Apartheid and refused to obey its laws. Most importantly, when she was banned, a very harsh punishment which was accepted without question, Winnie, unbanned herself. On May 12, 1969, Winnie was a 33-year-old mother taking care of two young daughters aged nine and 10 and whose husband was six years into a life sentence. That morning, the Apartheid monsters from hell struck, abducting her from her Soweto home, taking her through a 491-day (16 months) detention during which she was subjected to unspeakable atrocities some of which she refused to talk about. Although a woman who had not entered menopause, she was denied a bath for months. She almost lost her mind and contemplated suicide over a period. She said of her experience: \u201cSolitary confinement is worse than hard labour. When you do hard labour, you are with other prisoners, you can tolerate it because you all dig together, you communicate and you are alive. Solitary confinement is meant to kill you alive. It is the most vicious punishment that you could wish your worst enemy. You are imprisoned in this little cell. When you stretch your hands, you touch the walls. You are reduced to a nobody, a non-value. It is like killing you alive.\u201d Despite her ordeals, when she was brought to trial, charged with 540 offences of terrorism including furthering communism and the aims of the African National Congress, ANC, and conspiring to commit sabotage, she told Apartheid Judge Bekker that she considered her trial as: \u201cunjust, immoral, soul-corrosive and physically destructive\u2026 I consider it difficult to enter a plea because I regard myself as already being found guilty.\u201d Tortured, held in solitary confinement, deprived of family, with assassination attempts and her home bombed twice, Winnie survived the brutality and violence of Apartheid, emerging like gold from the crucible. She was to say: \u201cThere is no longer anything I can fear. There is nothing the government has not done to me. There isn\u2019t any pain I haven\u2019t known.\u201d When the anti-Apartheid struggles became bloodier from the mid-1980s and the struggles were in the streets with massacres and betrayals, there was what was later called \u2018Necklacing\u2019 which was placing a burning tyre full of petrol on the victim\u2019s neck. Winnie broke ranks with the ANC by endorsing it. She declared: \u201cWith our necklacing, we shall liberate this country.\u201d It is easy for some to criticise her for this and her resort to self-help including running informal bodyguards called the Mandela United Football Club, but these were in the days of apartheid violence when the state was out to physically eliminate fighters like Winnie. They were the days of apartheid lawlessness when it was criminal to be law-abiding. My generation was quite familiar with the name, Nelson Mandela, but not his face; it was the face of Winnie we could identify with. When he was released from prison on February 11, 1990 and the image was beamed across the world walking with Winnie, we readily could identify Winnie but had to get used to registering the face of the legendary Nelson. She was one of the main persons that kept his memory alive in those lonely 27 years in prison. Those years were to put a heavy strain on their marriage which later broke down. Winnie who passed away this Monday, April 2, 2018, thought the ANC conceded too much to the White regime in the negotiations leading to independence and on the land issue. She was a young lady drawn into the vortex of the struggle to liberate our continent from servitude, Apartheid and colonialism. Winnie played her part courageously and became one of the undisputed leaders of the African people. She was the best known of the famous South African women fighters who were leaders in the Anti-Apartheid War. Preceding Winnie in solitary confinement, was Ruth First who after 117 days in Apartheid jail, fled in 1963. On August 17, 1982, she was killed in Maputo, Mozambique by a letter bomb sent to her by security agents of the Apartheid regime. Another whose life trajectory has similarities with Winnie, was Albertina Nontsikelelo Sisulu. Her husband, Walter was a leader of the ANC like Nelson Mandela, they were both charged with treason and sentenced to life in prison on the notorious Robben Island. Albertina, like Winnie, was held a number of times in solitary confinement. When anti-apartheid movements in South Africa united to found the United Democratic Front, UDF, to pull down the apartheid structures, Albertina led the organisation. After liberation, she sat in parliament with her husband. She passed away on June 2, 2011. Just as the South African Government prepares to give Winnie a state funeral on April 14, so is it also preparing for the Centenary of Albertina Sisulu who was born in October 1918. May we be worthy heirs of these outstanding mothers of Africa. Related",

        "title": "What does Buhari owe them?",
        "author": "Azu Ishiekwene",
        "text": "By Azu Ishiekwene Governor Yahaya Bello does not need to jump into the fire, yet. The Kogi State governor who had, in fact, sprained an ankle in what might have been a practice match for the big leap, was saved the trouble after President Muhammadu Buhari finally gave the hint that he would run for a second term in office. Buhari The governor had said that if Buhari asked him to jump into the fire, he would. Perhaps the only thing that might have tempted him to jump without Buhari asking is Buhari refusing to run again. The Kano State Governor, Abdullahi Ganduje, has also been saved the trouble of incurring expensive legal fees. Days before Buhari gave the hint that he would re-contest, the Kano State governor threatened to sue Buhari if he decided not to run or delayed the announcement any further. Also before he was pressed to the edge of the cliff, the Chairman of the All Progressives Congress, John Odigie-Oyegun, had said like it or not, Buhari must run because Nigeria had no alternative. The surprise is not the vows of extreme personal sacrifice that the Buharists have made to force his hand or their extravagant it\u2019s-him-or-no-other posture. We have seen it many times before. In an earlier life, Asari Dokubo threatened that President Goodluck Jonathan was incapable of declining to contest re-election. \u201cE no fit na! Ah\u2026How?\u201d Dokubo mused in a video that was aimed below the former President\u2019s belt, targeting his self-esteem. Tompolo, the militant, oil pipeline guardian and saboteur-in-chief, joined in the gravy train to warn that any attempt to stop Jonathan from re-contesting might end the country. A mini version of this familiar drama was staged years earlier when former army and defence chief, T. Y. Danjuma, said he would go on self-exile if then candidate Olusegun Obasanjo was not elected president in 1999. Old playbook The politicians are taking a leaf from the old playbook. There\u2019s a sense in which it seems that Buhari owes these fellows something that he is not even entitled to think about before consenting to. Much more than his talismanic effect that they think they need to win in their own corner, they probably think he also owes them the nation\u2019s soul as a burnt offering. Or what else do they really want from Buhari? He wants to run again, not because he is convinced it\u2019s best for him or the country; but because \u201che\u2019s responding to the clamour by Nigerians.\u201d By the way, a free people do not clamour; they request. But it\u2019s understandable. Bello owes his improbable rise to power to Buhari; and whatever Odigie-Oyegun may be going through now, without Buhari\u2019s backing, he would have been finished long ago. As for Ganduje, he is in the Buhari bandwagon for what he can get \u2013 the same motivation that attracted him to former Governor Rabiu Kwankwaso, whom he served energetically for eight years, with the famous double-minded loyalty of many PDP politicians. The surprise is not the overzealousness of Bello and co. It\u2019s the anguished silence of those who supported Buhari not just in 2015 when he won, but each time on the three previous occasions when he lost. A chunk of his original supporters who lifted him from the deck \u2013 those his wife, Aisha, feared might rebel \u2013 has been silent, resigned in malicious acquiescence, or stirred up in angry defiance. When Buhari did not look like it, T. Y. Danjuma was one of the few who not only believed in him, but who also put his money where his mouth was. In the days when Buhari\u2019s ANPP could barely pay for space for a public rally and a PDP arrowhead said candidate Buhari did not know the difference between a Blackberry phone and the berry fruit, Danjuma was among the very few that Buhari could still depend on. Old chapter, new friends As at Tuesday when Buhari announced his intention to run for office again, his government\u2019s poor handling of the deadly herdsmen-farmers clashes had put a wedge between him and Danjuma. For the first time in the last 15 years, Buhari would take the plunge unsure of the active support of Danjuma, one of his most ardent supporters now bruised and left stranded by government officials for his frank comment on Taraba. Tunde Bakare may not have had the same long relationship with Buhari like Danjuma but his honesty and total commitment since he ran as the President\u2019s running mate seven years ago has been tested again and again in recent times. Hours after Buhari signaled his intention to run again, Bakare reportedly told Daily Sun that he would support Buhari, if the president pitched him; but you could almost feel that the hubris of a presidential wedding party train in Kano only hours after the kidnap of the Dapchi girls and the incompetent handling of the herdsmen-farmers\u2019 killings have taken their toll on Bakare. This was not the Buhari he ran with seven years ago. But why, the bow has left the arrow: he\u2019s welcome to run again. As for Kwankwaso under whose watch Kano delivered perhaps the most consequential single block of votes in the 2015 presidential election, and Governor Samuel Ortom who was, in fact, one of the earliest to endorse a Buhari second term, both have fallen on the wrong side the power play. There is an irrational fear of Kwankwaso\u2019s clout, while Ortom is out of favour for standing up for the people of Benue. The fire this time But neither Danjuma nor Bakare nor Kwankwaso nor Ortom matters as much as the hundreds of thousands of young people who had invested their hope in Buhari, eight million of whom have lost their jobs since he took office three years ago \u2013 an average of two million plus every year he has spent in office. It doesn\u2019t matter what those who are happy to be trampled over for Buhari\u2019s re-election may say, he\u2019ll be walking a more difficult road this time. Not necessarily because most second term presidents are victims of a jaded honeymoon, but because he has done little in three years to straighten his own path. He has been a ceremonial president enjoying the pleasure and entitlement of office, while part outsourcing and part abdicating the dirty work. His wife was right. The rebellion she predicted is on and gaining momentum. But it\u2019s not just among his core supporters, as she had said. Millions of Nigerians who may not have voted for him but yet gave him the benefit of the doubt that he would be a president for all have been heartbroken and left behind. That forlorn hope, the broken promise, will come back to haunt him, and the latter-day interlopers will find it hard to save him. Yahaya and co would not need to jump into the fire for Buhari. The fire will come to their doorsteps. Ishiekwene is the Managing Director/Editor-In-Chief of The Interview and member of the board of the Global Editors Network. Related",

        "author": "Ochereome Nnanna",
        "text": "By Ochereome Nnanna DURING the presidential campaigns towards the 2015 elections, many people believed that the Cambridge West African School Certificate released by the Katsina College to prove candidate Major General Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s qualification was a \u201cforgery\u201d. Even I wasn\u2019t so sure of its authenticity, many things about it taken into account. But when you examined the figures recorded as his scores which showed he was a less than average student in academic work, your doubt was a bit doused. An outright forgery would put out Buhari, who had a cult following in Arewa North (and no less in his alma mater) in flying colours. But we saw a student who failed in Mathematics and Woodwork but managed a Pass in English Literature. He barely scraped through college. Major General Muhammadu Buhari (rtd), Happily, in most cases, academic scores do not say everything about the prospects of a young person. Many \u201cfirst class\u201d graduates often find themselves as misfits when it comes to deploying that brain power to solve problems. Some of them are not even effective teachers. But Buhari, you must admit, went on to be a great success in life. What more is success than when a person rises to the top of his chosen career? How many people have ruled their countries twice, first as military officers and then as elected civilian presidents 30 years later? As successful as Buhari has been, his childhood academic disabilities appear to have continued to haunt him even as an elected president. You will recall that moment of great national embarrassment when he visited US President, Barack Obama. Buhari was a guest at the US Institute of Peace on July 24, 2015, nearly two months after he assumed power. His performance at that fateful forum essentially confirmed that his Cambridge WAEC \u201cfeat\u201d 53 years ago was not a fluke. A lady journalist asked our new president how he would handle the issue of \u201cinclusive governance\u201d. Buhari was visibly confused. He turned to the moderator of the event, who took about 30 seconds to explain the meaning of this to him before he faced the cameras once again to address it! At that moment, the school certificate saga flashed through minds of millions of Nigerians. When the President finished telling us how he intended to handle \u201cinclusive governance\u201d he left us aghast. In summary, he told the world that he was not going to run inclusive governance, though he would ensure that whatever the Constitution says he must do he would do it. He propounded a queer mathematical formula \u2013 the now infamous Formula \u201c97%/5%\u201d. In mathematical terms, it should be either \u201c97%/3%\u201d or \u201c95%/5%\u201d. But most Nigerians did not bother to go picking nits on Buhari\u2019s math: they understood what he meant. He actually went ahead to explain it for avoidance of doubt. He said he would give the lion\u2019s share of the goodies of his government to those who laboured, \u201cmade sacrifices\u201d and mobilised voters to install him in power. He described this as \u201cpolitical reality\u201d. When he started gathering people to form the base of his government who did we see? We saw the President\u2019s kinsmen and women, people of his ethnic or cultural stock, people of the North, mostly Muslims dominating the critical centres of the Presidency, the Federal Bureaucracy (ministries, departments and agencies, especially where a lot of power and money pass through), the electoral umpire, the security apparatus and state agencies of coercion. By the time the constitutionallydecreed sharing of ministerial positions came, Buhari\u2019s \u201cpeople\u201d had grabbed the pole positions of the Federal Government. When Nigerians complained, his presidential spin artists said Buhari had \u201ccarefully chosen people he knew and trusted\u201d for these strategic posts. This did not help matters because it simply painted a picture of the President as a man who did not know many people outside his native cultural Muslim North, even after his successful career as a senior military officer, former head of state, former Executive Chairman of the Petroleum Trust Fund and four-time presidential candidate. It was an indictment that portrayed Buhari as a man not fit to be president of Nigeria. If Buhari gave strategic kitchen cabinet positions to people he knew and not just his kinsmen and regional acolytes, how come that core All Nigerian Peoples Party, ANPP, purists like Chief George Moghalu were not remembered? Moghalu has been with the political movement that has now become the APC even before Buhari joined politics in 2003. I remember a former ANPP governorship candidate from the South East who sat in the same car and campaigned with Buhari when the former presidential candidate of the defunct party toured the zone in 2007. He related his experiences to me: \u201cDo you know that three days after the South East tour when we went for a rally in Abuja and I went to greet this man, he did not know me again!\u201d In anger, he left the ANPP for the All Progressives Grand Alliance, APGA. The truth of the matter is that if Buhari cared to know and cultivate people outside Arewa North he had ample opportunities to do so. Olusegun Obasanjo, his co-traveller, cultivated people from across the divides and had no problem at any time forming a broad-based government both at kitchen cabinet and ministerial levels. Buhari\u2019s apologists were fond of saying that he was right to give powerful positions to those who helped make him president. They were correct, but within reason. He could be justified to return favours, but there is no justification for the exclusion or marginalisation of any part of the country. There is no doubt that Buhari followed his formula \u201c97%/5%\u201d and gave the North more than its fair share of governmental positions while shutting out the South East. He displayed barefaced favouritism. He even gave more to the South-South which, like their South East neighbours, did not vote for him, while relegating the South West, the region that put him in power, to the background. Even if he can justify sidelining the Igbos for preferring former President Goodluck Jonathan, what about the Yorubas who gave him the alliance and votes that put him in power? In a civilised, democratic society you do not sideline a section of the country because they did not vote for you. The majority vote you get is to enable you serve the whole country through the implementation of your campaign promises. That a section of the country did not vote for you only means they preferred the programmes or candidate of the party of their choice. The only thing they can lose when you come to power is that you implement your party\u2019s programmes and not those of their preferred party. You do not exclude even your party members because they come from a section where you did not win. Buhari must be reminded that the presidential office he is occupying belongs to all Nigerians. The public resources he is disbursing belong to all Nigerians and should be used to cater equitably for all, not just his kinsmen and \u201cthose he knows\u201d. The Constitution that empowers him to be our president commands that he must give all Nigerians their due and not run the country in a manner that will favour one section more than the others. Buhari\u2019s \u201cFormula 97%/5%\u201d is unconstitutional, unpatriotic and partly responsible for the agitations for self-determination in the South East and parts of the South-South. The President must put away this evil formula and toe the path of nationalism, patriotism and constitutionalism. *ON THIS NOTE, I CLOSE SHOP FOR THE YEAR FOR MY ANNUAL VACATION.

                "message": "<p>Col. Joe Achuzia was one of the major figures that held Biafra together while the Nigerian Civil war lasted. He commanded almost all the major sectors in the Biafran Army and also ensured that discipline was enforced throughout the duration of the war. Before the war ended, he was in charge of operations in the whole enclave called Biafra. This position made it possible for him to begin the necessary overtures to end the war. While Ojukwu was away, he took over control of the forces and then made the appropriate contacts to bring the war to an end. In this interview with Edozie Udeze, he debunks some of the claims made by Gen. Alabi Isama and Gen. Alani Akinrinade in their recent interviews.</p><p>Gen. Alabi Isama in his latest book on the war alleged that Mid-western officers were alienated. Is it really true that as the Commander-in-Chief of the Biafran Armed Forces, Chukwuemeka Odumegwu Ojukwu, did not trust some of the Midwestern Igbo officers while the war lasted?</p><p>It is not true. Why I say it is not true is that for Biafra to have lasted so long, it was as a result of the efforts of the Mid-western officers. This was because Biafra was really being hard pushed until the mid-west operation began.</p><p>And the Midwest officers that were supposed to go across, Alabi-Isama was one of them. Even then my own journey into the mid west when Banjo crossed into Mid west, Alabi too was one of those that I contacted. But somewhere along the line, after our meeting, after we gave him some instructions to follow across, Alabi defected. And he didn\u2019t come back. So, for him to say that Ojukwu didn\u2019t like some Mid west officers couldn\u2019t be true. This was so because it was the Mid-west officers, all the way to the lower ranks, that really held Murtala from crossing over the bridge thereby entering Biafra.</p><p>This was when Murtala started his so-called operation to cross the Niger. It was mid western officers who fought and sustained the momentum. These were the 52 and 57 brigades that are also manned by the Mid west officers. It is unfortunate that many people from hindsight now after over 40 years of the war are writing books on the war. This is an after-thought after having read over other people\u2019s works on the war, reading newspaper comments and other people\u2019s statements and interviewing people. Now, they have got themselves in the position as being authority on the war.</p><p>I wouldn\u2019t take Alabi\u2019s document as a serious one. The only aspect of his statement that really deserves comment and which shows his inability to appreciate the war situation and reporting it as it were, was his reporting what did not happen in his presence. He talked about the end of the war, mentioning the participants. He is not in the position to say what he said about the end of the war. He wasn\u2019t there.</p><p>The first person who was there was General Alani Akinrinade. Also Tomoye. Then Tomoye was not a substantive colonel. The command that reached Orlu was Tomoye\u2019s command. And it was Tomoye\u2019s officer that my men and in a night operation and captured them that made it possible for me to take the step I took by declaring that everybody should lay down their arms. Then I said we could be announcing it until I was able to bring Akinrinade into my headquarters. The narrative by Alabi shows ignorance of what happened that day. That\u2019s what I can say about that. The only person that many a time I look at and say let sleeping dogs lie is General Akinrinade. This was because of his behaviour from the moment we met was officer-like.</p><p>And he conducted himself in a way that endeared him to me that up till date, we are still friends. Alabi, however, was right in one thing that the war had already ended before General Obasanjo came into the picture. And he came on the scene after I allowed General Akinrinade to make a call to him. And he told him that if he didn\u2019t come, he might stand to lose his officers who were under my control then. When Akinrinade came, he came with only a few soldiers. We met at Orlu, I didn\u2019t go to Owerri to look for any of them.</p><p>Now, we told Tomoye to phone him because Tomoye stood to lose all his officers and in Brigade they ventured into our territory near Orlu.</p><p>We assured Tomoye that we had already started to take steps to bring the war to an end. His officers that were collected were already deposited near my office in Igbo-ukwu. As a result, it wasn\u2019t proper for me to claim that I went to Owerri looking for who to surrender to. Surrender who or what to who? After all, it was in my house while discussing with Akinrinade that we decided that in that instance we were bringing the war to an end. There was indeed no winner, no vanquished. The war had deteriorated into a state of stalemate, whereby we were trading one bullet for another.</p><p>By this time our men were crisis-crossing the war front because both the Nigerian soldiers and our soldiers were tired of the whole thing; the whole episode.</p><p>Could you please elaborate more on the last days of the war?</p><p>Let me also elaborate more on the events of the last days\u2026</p><p>I read in the internet Akinrinade\u2019s rejoinder. So I asked for it to be printed out. Akinrinade is the last person I expected to sanction what Alabi-Isama wrote or said about the end of the war. Isama wasn\u2019t there. Akinrinade was there. Tomoye was there. The rest were just junior officers. Those collected that night of 11th were junior officers and they were in charge of a battalion which made it possible for us to move. It was almost a disaster. We could have capitalised on it but we were on the quest to bring the war to an end. Hence, we detained them at the DMI office in Igbo-ukwu, got them to send a message to their commander, Tomoye. Tomoye replied that he would contact Owerri. The officer at Owerri tactical headquarters, Col. Oni who replied that Obasanjo said he would send his chief-of-staff, Akinrinade, to come and negotiate with us.</p><p>That was how Akinrinade came to the scene. And we asked when would this be? He said that myself and himself should meet at Orlu. Hence, I left, heading to Orlu with my own escort, while he was coming with his own escort. We met at Orlu, greeted one another and I asked that he follows me to Igbo-ukwu. If it was a war situation and they had the advantage they would have arrested me and held me hostage. But we were already holding their men hostage. That was how we came to my home and I am glad that Alabi confirmed that because Akinrinade told him.</p><p>So, I had to do what I did because I was in full control of the situation. There was no way Akinrinade could have reached me in a hostile manner. I was the one who would have shown hostility but my mission was to bring the war to an end.</p><p>I would have handed over to Bisala. Bisala\u2019s men were at Awka, which as you know, is closer to my headquarters. When we concluded no winner, no vanquished affair with Obasanjo, treachery came into it. While we were all celebrating at Owerri, Obasanjo came to me and said whether he could talk to General Effiong and I said yes. Anything? He said no, just to discuss for old time sake. And I said okay, you can go ahead with him.</p><p>So, they went out to discuss. It was Col. Anwuna who called my attention and said why did you allow Effiong and Obasanjo to meet alone and I said well, they are old friends. He said no, you better intervene. Obasanjo said ah, I am not eating your officer; we were just talking about old times. But the damage had already been done. On our way back to Uga, because that was where we took off from, it was then that Effiong told me and the rest of the people that he had promised Obasanjo that we would be going to Lagos to see Gowon. I said no, you don\u2019t play a record we didn\u2019t participate in crafting. He said it was necessary that we senior officers go with him; that they would provide the flight so that we and Gowon could see, that he had the final say for them. I said okay if we must go, all of you must go and put on your uniforms. Then he turned around and told me he also promised him we should go in mufty. So, I said in that case, I will not go. That was why I wasn\u2019t in the entourage that went to Lagos. He said that it was important that I should go; that he even mentioned the names of the officers to go. I said, I will not go, I will not leave my troops undefended.</p><p>Col. Ogunewe, he was of the same stature with me, said please colonel you have done so much. Give me your French suit, we are of the same size.</p><p>So, he went in my place and that was why he was part of the team. I escorted them all the way to Owerri with reinforced company of soldiers. When we got to Owerri, Obasanjo and his men, with Col. Oni took over. They left from Port Harcourt. Instead, as they left from Port Harcourt, I continued with my company of soldiers all the way to Port Harcourt. Akinrinade will attest to this.</p><p>When we got to Port Harcourt, I reported to Col. Oluleye who was the war commander. We booked in at the Presidential Hotel with my men surrounding me. It was in the morning, they had gone to Lagos, finished and Obasanjo brought them back and I was quite sure Obasanjo was monitoring what was happening and had been told by Akinrinade that I was in Port Harcourt with my troops. So, he arrived early hours in the morning with Effiong and the rest and they left for Owerri. Then he sent Akinrinade to call me. He came to the hotel and told me that Obasanjo was back and wanted to see me.</p><p>I went with my troops to Owerri and we met and greeted. So, he said to me, was there any need for me to come with my troops?. And I said no. it was necessary for me because it was the cream of my men that you collected. Then we saluted and they escorted me across the Imo River at Owerri Nta. From there, I proceeded back to my home. Now, is that the position of a defeated army? If they want us to tell the truth about what happened, we\u2019ll tell the truth. But for a group of people trying to make it look as if Biafra looked like a lily-livered army or a rag-tag army, no. No rag-tag army at all could hold a well-equipped army like Nigerian army to ransom for three years.</p><p>The only thing, I repeat, is that the ground strategy adopted by Biafra made it possible for Nigeria to remain till today.</p><p>In the face of all this, how did you warm your way into Ojukwu\u2019s heart to become his favourite among other officers from the Mid-west?</p><p>I don\u2019t know about being anybody\u2019s favourite. All I know is that each time Ojukwu gave me order I obeyed it. That people consider me his favourite, well why should a commander-in-chief, have a favourite? All his officers were his favourites. For anybody to consider himself not to be a favourite of the commander-in-chief he must have been harbouring some disloyalty attitude in his mind towards the commander-in-chief.</p><p>But was Alabi-Isama fighting on the side of Biafra initially?</p><p>No! He was one of the Mid-west officers in Benin. He was in Benin at the beginning.</p><p>Now, let us look at another issue. Is it really correct to assert that while the federal troops had prisoners of war, Biafran soldiers were busy killing indiscriminately?</p><p>Let me ask you, when Nigeria claimed that they won the war, were there any exchange of prisoners of war? Because that would have been the situation. There wasn\u2019t. By the time the matter got to Lagos to Gowon, the war had been over. It was more of war of attrition at a point and so as it was on the Federal side so it was on the Biafran side.</p><p>But why did you call for an end to the war when you did?</p><p>We did so because of the situation we found ourselves. Certain things were happening at the time which up till now we haven\u2019t told our people. For instance, they said Ojukwu left because the war was closing in on him and the entire Biafra. That also is not true. We had several options then. One of the options was to break out of the Biafra enclave to cause confusion. But we had studiously maintained that we were not trying to create a civil war but we were still being attacked based on the perceived situation that brought about the pogrom.</p><p>Good enough, it was the pogrom that chased people out of the North. And when our people left the North, the pogrom continued and this made it impossible for our people to find relief in the West. There was no other alternative than to say, \u2018to your tents oh Israel.\u2019 So, our people left and came home. And even when organising the military defensive activity we still had it in mind that we couldn\u2019t abandon a country we helped to build.</p><p>But we couldn\u2019t in trying to maintain the status quo we helped to build allowed ourselves to be exterminated. No. Consequently, we retreated. By retreating, regrouping, we said we will not carry our military exploits beyond our shores. Otherwise, as it were, we had several options. Take a brigade and break into Nigeria and cause havoc. That would have made the war total, but instead under the counsel of our commander-in-chief and our elders, we maintained an operational balance.</p><p>It was for us to defend ourselves within our soil so that nobody could accuse us of either precipitating the war or as they try to accuse us that the coup was tailored against the North, an Igbo coup. If such a coup that had a universal acclaim could later change into an Igbo coup, what then would have happened if we had carried the war right into the North. The possibility was there and we didn\u2019t do that.</p><p>But then when Igbo officers and men crossed into the West why were they not coordinated, allowing soldiers scatter into different directions?</p><p>No! No!! You see the war,\u2026 Every war produces certain actions and reactions. When it became clear after the second division of Nigerian army crossed over and attacked Biafra, we already heard that they were going to use the Mid-west whom we thought was the buffer zone between us and them. But the rampaging Nigerian army did not honour that. We were not prepared to allow them because once they did, it meant that they had three-quarters of the totality of the land in Nigeria. And that would have been very difficult for us.</p><p>We were also mindful of the fact that during the pogrom in the North, the majority of the soldiers as far as the North was concerned, Midwest was an Igbo land. It was in fact an afterthought when they tried to woo the Benins, the Urhobo\u2019s and so on, forgetting that the Benins and Urhobos were some of those they killed during the pogrom.</p><p>So, ranging them against us by pacifying them as they did when they created Cross-River and Rivers States, it was not done to appease the North. No. it was done to range them against the Igbo people by telling them that they were sufficient to be on their own as states. And that they should not be an appendage of the Igbos. They even forgot that we could have done the same by moving into the North, bringing the Middlebelt against the Fulanis.</p><p>But we didn\u2019t do that. So, that was what it was like.</p><p>Okay, were all these part of the blunders that prolonged the war?</p><p>Of course, yes. If we had played the game the way Nigeria played it, we would still be in the battle field today. But our people have a saying that the hen with so many chicks doesn\u2019t know how to run in a battle situation.</p><p>At what point did the Biafran high command begin to consider some of the officers as saboteurs and what did it take one to be so considered?</p><p>In many war situations, the word sabotage is a constant and recurrent decimal. This is so because not all believe in the cause that brought about the war situation. People have different ideas and ideals. And some people, according to their belief, put themselves in the position where they were either the loyalists or considered anti-war efforts. This was what gave rise to the word saboteur. So it happens everywhere and it occurs everywhere.</p><p>You have nicknamed the Air Raid. How did this name come about?</p><p>Oh, no, no. I can\u2019t continue to dwell on this.</p><p>But you\u2019ve not told it to us before?</p><p>Okay, why I say so is that soldiers, especially in a conflict situation have the tendency for giving one name or the other to their officers, depending on the situation they find themselves. So, they did that when they wanted.</p><p>You didn\u2019t start out as a commissioned officer, but rose to be a force to reckon with. How did it happen?</p><p>No, no. you see, people don\u2019t seem to understand that soldiering is an art. Just like engineering or medicine, when a doctor is made to be so. You cannot just go into an operating room, pick up your instruments and begin to work, if you haven\u2019t been trained. So also in a war situation. You cannot go into battle field and carry out all the norms necessary for an officer who had been trained over the years.</p><p>A civilian cannot plan war and execute war. It requires a trained military officer to confuse and configure the situation and operate. That is why many a time people say what they like and I don\u2019t care. It doesn\u2019t affect people like me; I am not interested. The situation occured within the purview of my duty and I operated just to show what I was trained for. After that I retired into a civilian life.</p><p>What really happened \u2013 did you actually kill Haliday, the owner of Silver Valley Hotel in the presence of his wife and daughter as alleged by General Alani Akinrinade?</p><p>That\u2019s a lie. You see, when the war ended, Nigerian officers didn\u2019t know what to do about me. First, they couldn\u2019t reach me. Every effort made to kill me did not succeed. Haliday was a friend. My house, before the war started, was a stone\u2019s throw from Chief Haliday\u2019s house. If such a thing happened, why was it only at the end of the war that we started hearing that I was the one that killed him?</p><p>I commanded; I took over in Port Harcourt, when Port Harcourt was falling. And all that participated there will give testimony that I never picked a gun and shot him. I never picked my gun and shot at somebody. Why should I? I had soldiers who could do that. But instead, they tried to foist the death of Haliday on me. That exactly was what they\u2019ve been saying; that I had been killing people indiscriminately while the war lasted. That also is not true. It took the way the war ended for most Biafrans to realise that it was really a lie that whenever I saw somebody I\u2019d shoot. Shoot for what? For what purpose? And if that was the case, would I lay my life on the line to bring the war to an end? After all, the people who asked that the war be brought to an end are still alive. People like P.K. Nwokedi, a former justice of Enugu. Louis Mbanefo too. These were the people who came to my house and pleaded that I should try to stop the war.</p><p>Normally, I would have called for their arrest, because they were members of Biafran Exco. They were party to the last meeting we held with Ojukwu to ask Ojukwu to go to the conference that was to hold in Monrovia, Liberia. That conference was engineered by Dr. Nnamdi Azikiwe.</p><p>It was this meeting that we arranged laboriously for where Ojukwu could stay so that there won\u2019t be any sabotage against us. Hence, Felix Houphet- Boigny was one of those that recognised Biafran efforts. And the French were also partially assisting us.</p><p>So, from Liberia, it was planned to move Ojukwu to Gabon and then to Ivory Coast. But we hadn\u2019t settled down in Ivory Coast in readiness for the meeting when members of the EXco came requesting that I should bring the war to an end.</p><p>How come then you were the man everybody wanted to see to end the war?</p><p>I was the person in charge of operations. I was also visible. Yes, I was.</p><p>Do you think because the Yoruba officers were the ones that saw to the end of the war, it has caused any friction between them and the Igbo people?</p><p>No, because a day after my declaration, I started the announcement from 9a.m. Every 15 minutes, my broadcast was on. Sir Louis Mbanefo crafted the statement that we gave Philip Effiong to read. After it was read, it became necessary because in my broadcast, we said we had sent emissaries to various Nigerian military formations to inform them that we had decided to end the war.</p><p>It is only people with authority who could do that. Any army on the run will not make such statement. So, we did it on a friendly basis. Today Akin is still my friend. We meet from time to time. He visits me here too. No, it has not caused any friction at all.</p><p>Why was it possible for the Owerri battle front to be inclusive as it were?</p><p>First and foremost, to take over Owerri was impossible. Owerri is the heartland of the Igbo nation. The heart land of our domain. Enugu is our foremost town which was prepared by the colonial masters as an administrative headquarters. Just as Lagos is to the West, even though Ibadan was the heartland of the Yoruba. So, also in the North, they have Kaduna State, which now they have Abuja, even though they have Sokoto, Maiduguiri and those other places.</p><p>Nigeria is centered on a tripod, whichever way you push it, all that come to the surface are the Hausa nation, the Yoruba nation and the Igbo nation. Each of these nations has minorities. Today, all that people talk about are the minorities within the East, within the Igbo nation because of economic interest. If oil has not been the main source of income for the totality of Nigerians, nobody would care how the Ijaws, how the Itsekiris, the Ibibios, Kalabairis, the Efiks and so on, are faring. This is so because they\u2019ve been in existence before the arrival of the Europeans.</p>",

        "title": "Diplomacy of Homosexuality",
        "author": "None",
        "text": "BRITISH Prime Minister, Theresa May had a clear message, or more appropriately, directive to the 53 leaders of the former British colonies euphemistically called \u2018Commonwealth,\u201d who gathered at the Westminster on Tuesday. Britain\u2019s Prime Minister Theresa May (L) poses with Nigeria\u2019s President Muhammadu Buhari (R) on the step of 10 Downing Street in London on April 16, 2018 ahead of a meeting on the sidelines of the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting (CHOGM). The Matron told them to return home and promote homosexuality. She told them point blank that leaders of the 37 Commonwealth countries who have laws that do not favour gays and lesbians, should return home and reverse them. Like a mother talking to her kids, she promised them lollipops in the form of aid to enable them dismantle all laws that criminalise or do not favour homosexuality. Aunty May presented her crusade for homosexuality as fundamental human rights and sought to equate it with women rights which are human rights. Her song about: \u201cCriminalising same-sex relations and failing to protect women and girls,\u201d deliberately seeks to confuse issues; mixing or equating homosexuality with girl or women rights. When she said: \u201cI am all too aware that these laws were put in place by my own country; they were wrong then and they are wrong now\u2026As the UK\u2019s Prime Minister, I deeply regret that those laws were introduced\u2026\u201d the British leader, could only have been speaking for her country. For us in Africa, we were not wrong about those laws then, and we are not wrong now, so there is nothing to regret and we do not owe homosexuals any apology. Clearly, when Ms. May told the forum that: \u201cAs a family of nations, we must respect one another\u2019s cultures and traditions, but we must do so in a manner consistent with our common value of equality,\u201d she was being disrespectful to us Africans. If she respects our cultures and traditions, she and her government would not be trying to impose a culture of homosexuality on us. Although Britain may seek to deceive Africans enslaved by her that they belong to a \u2018commonwealth,\u2019 clearly, they do not have the same \u201ccommon value of equality.\u201d Our values are clearly different and what constitutes \u2018equality\u2019 to the former colonial master, does not mean same to us, just as we had fundamental differences when Britain characterised African liberation fighters like Nelson Mandela, Joe Slovo and Walter Sisulu as \u201cterrorists.\u201d It was the same fundamental differences we expressed in 2014 with our soul brother, Barack Obama, then President of the United States who turned himself into the Sales Manager of homosexuality in Africa. That year when Uganda decided to enact a law against homosexuality, Obama in a public statement, claimed that \u201cIt will be a step backward for all Ugandans and reflect poorly on Uganda\u2019s commitment to protecting the human rights of its people. It also will mark a serious setback for all those around the world who share a commitment to freedom, justice and equal rights.\u201d He then threatened the African country that: \u201cEnacting this legislation will complicate our valued relationship with Uganda.\u201d When Obama was becoming too overbearing on homosexuality, the irrepressible Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe declared in 2015, \u201cI\u2019ve just concluded \u2013 since President Obama endorses same-sex marriage, advocates homosexual people, and enjoys an attractive countenance \u2013 thus if it becomes necessary, I shall travel to Washington, DC, get down on my knee, and ask his hand\u2026We ask, was he born out of homosexuality? We need continuity in our race, and that comes from the woman; and no to homosexuality. John and John, no; Maria and Maria, no.\u201d For being outspoken against homosexuals, Mugabe was widely attacked in the West, and on March 5, 2001 while on a visit in Brussels, a Briton, Peter Tatchell attempted what he claimed was a citizens\u2019 arrest of Mugabe, a sitting African President. The nuclear family is the most basic distinction between Africa and Europe; for us, a marriage is between a woman and a man, while for the European, it could be between a man and a woman, a man and a fellow man, (we call it bone-to-bone) or a woman and another woman (flesh-to -flesh). The typical African nuclear family is made up of a man and his wife, and if blessed, plus their child or children. In contrast, the European nuclear family might be two men, two women (a so-called partnership), a woman and her dog or cat. Another vital difference between Africans and Europeans is that for the former, sex is a private matter. It is a closet issue; who you sleep with, is your personal business, not that of the public. In contrast, the trend in Europe is to make sex between two persons, a public matter and even, a casual encounter like going to buy sweet in a neigbourhood shop. So while there are doubtlessly homosexuals in Africa, unlike Europe, they do not advertise it, carry placards or emblazon it on their t-shirts, announcing their sexual preferences. In Europe, advertising one\u2019s sexual orientation is chic; without provocation, a person calls a press conference to announce he is gay or she is a lesbian, of what benefit to humanity is that? Promoting homosexuality as modernism; as a culture superior to our way of life, as Ms. May and her tribe are doing, do not advance human development. The arrogance of people like the British Prime Minister who assume that knowledge and civilisation reside in them and that they are on a civilising mission, is typically colonial and it is not surprising that she picked a neo-colonial club like the Commonwealth to stage her play on homosexuality. Just as individuals have rights, so do communities and societies; there is something called group rights which I hold to be more fundamental than individual rights. The collective rights of the African people, are more much fundamental than the individual rights of the gay or lesbian and European and American leaders need to respect the rights, traditions, cultures and sensitivity of the African people. We Africans owe it a duty to ourselves, our ancestors and our children to maintain family life and dignity. Our positive culture, traditions and norms must not be surrendered to foreign decadence even if such is couched as \u2018human right\u2019 and marketed as a commodity with discounts just as life-size doll babies are now being marketed as acceptable \u2018sexual partners.\u2019 Africa needs assistance, it may need aid, but not the type Aunty May offered at the Commonwealth. The aid Africa needs is the type that would assist her build homes, schools, factories, roads and railways, not the one to campaign for a culture of homosexuality that will compromise and destroy the nuclear family.

        "title": "Randy professors and the rest of us",
        "author": "Muyiwa Adetiba",
        "text": "By Muyiwa Adetiba Both the mainstream and social media have been full of condemnations\u2014and rightly so\u2014 for the randy Professor who wanted to \u2018knack\u2019\u2014forgive my vulgarity\u2014a girl young enough to be his grand-daughter five times before he could raise her marks from 33 to 40 \u2014a rough translation of one \u2018round\u2019 per mark with two bonus marks that would probably be contingent on \u2018satisfactory performance.\u2019 I shudder and develop goose pimples as I think of my two daughters and what they would have had to do to graduate had they studied in Nigeria and their cousins, my nieces, who actually studied here. How many \u2018rounds\u2019 did my nieces have to endure before they were allowed to graduate? Were they groped and defiled on the Professors\u2019 well-worn couches or in some slimy, \u2018short term\u2019 rooms across the hostels? Did they barter the number of rounds like some cheap whore the way the girl in the audio did or bantered with their lecherous adversaries, again like the girl, to reduce the gravity of the transaction? (How can anyone reduce the gravity of the act?) How scarred\u2014permanently or otherwise\u2014are the likes of my nieces by their experiences in the hands of lecturers who take more than they give, by the university system which looks the other way, perhaps out of complicity and by the society which plays the ostrich only to complain about the quality of our graduates. It is one thing to choose to date your lecturer or prefer a father figure as your lover\u2014even here\u2014the lecturers should exercise maturity and restraint and try to discourage the infatuation of youth. It is another thing to be compelled or blackmailed into doing it. The ripple effects go far beyond the one, two, or five rounds to the psyche of the victim, her future relationships, and the values of the society at large. We have all heard of stories of these randy Professors and their low moral values. But the lowest of the low was the story of a Professor who slept with\u2014I refuse to use the word date\u2014a young girl for two years and still failed her. His reason to his fellow conspirators was that she was \u2018too sweet\u2019 to be allowed to just go like that. And the callous, complicit old men, who must have daughters and daughters \u2013in-law of their own, simply laughed. i, I have heard comments from those who should know better, that many of the girls involved are willing victims because they are the ones who do not take their studies seriously and yet want to graduate. Some \u2018beg\u2019 for it by the way they dress and interact with lecturers. Even if true, this simply doesn\u2019t tell the whole story. There are lecturers who, emboldened by the powers of their office, feel it is their duty to \u2018rouse the fire\u2019 within the most detached and introverted student, or humiliate someone they feel is arrogant or self-confident or ravish anyone whose beauty intoxicates them. In any case, it their duty as teachers to fail any student who refuses to study. It is the only way to maintain the standard and quality of their profession and institution. Sex for marks is at best, a form of bribe. At the worst, it is a form of blackmail; of rape. Both are crimes. As indignant as we all are about the repugnant activities of our randy professors in our citadels of knowledge\u2014these activities are more rampant in state and federal universities across the country than we think\u2014there is a thread connecting them to the larger society. Those of us acting in self-righteous anger should reflect on the exchange between King David and Prophet Nathan in the Bible. Nathan told David of a rich man who had a large herd of cattle but chose to kill the only lamb of a poor man to entertain his guest. David was understandably angry and vowed that the rich man, whoever he is, must die. He was mortified when told he was that rich man. He had left his harem to pick the only wife of a poor soldier. So, as we point one accusing finger, three are pointing at us. The personnel manager who demands sex to shortlist desperate job applicants; the manager who demands sex to advance the career of his staff undeservedly; the chief executive who \u2018samples\u2019 every female staff at will; the procurement manager who uses sex for contracts; the governor who picks whoever tickles his fancy in the civil service; the policeman who sleeps with awaiting trial offenders; the \u2018master\u2019 who sleeps with the house maid; they, like King David and the randy Professors, have abused their positions. The common thread running through all of them is this sense of entitlement. They see females who work under them, who are dependent on them as fringe benefits. The feelings of those women are immaterial. The status of those women\u2014young, old, single or married\u2014is immaterial. The gradual erosion of their own values, self-worth and moral consciousness is immaterial. It is immaterial that they are violating an important law of decency and interpersonal relationships. Fortunately for them, we do not name and shame in Nigeria. And there is no due process that will lead to prosecution. So the sexual impunity continues, unabated, unrestrained. What makes the case of our randy professors worse is that universities are supposed to be a beacon of light in a darkened world. They are supposed to push for a better society through research and knowledge. They are supposed to stand on a higher moral and intellectual ground. Ours have become a closed society of incest, licentiousness, corruption and debauchery. Professors are respected all over the world for their intellect, devotion to knowledge, and moral standing. He is at the acme of knowledge in his chosen field towering over other professionals. We have, by the quality and actions of these bad eggs, successfully dragged the word \u2018Professor\u2019 to the mud in Nigeria. If anybody thinks anything is going to come out of the OAU tape, they are mistaken. Sexual licentiousness has eaten very deep into our university system. There is a story of a PhD student who was kept in school for 18 good years because she refused to have sex with her supervisor. Nothing happened to the supervisor even when the lady in question almost ran mad. It is not limited to students or sex for marks alone. Junior lecturers are being denied or rewarded by older professors depending on how they co-operate sexually. As I write, at least two sexual harassment cases are being swept under the carpet in UNILAG. It is a case of he who is without sin among the professors, let him cast the first stone. Sad. Related",

        "title": "The Anointing",
        "author": "Femi Aribisala",
        "text": "By Femi Aribisala Once they started praying, I became drunk in the Holy Spirit. As a new believer, every time I was in an anointed environment, my body (especially my right leg) would start to shake aggressively. When I asked the Lord about this, he answered through a message given by a pastor at one of our lunch-hour fellowships. anointing He said there was a man who noticed his body was always shaking during church services, so he decided to consult Pastor Adeboye of RCCG about it. Adeboye said his body also used to shake during services. When he took the matter to the Lord, God told him: \u201cThe anointing I want to give you is more than your body can withstand.\u201d In order to build up his spirit man to receive the power of God, Adeboye said he went on 100 days of prayer and fasting, and his body stopped shaking. Therefore, the man also did likewise. Prayer and fasting When I heard this story, I knew it was meant for me. I spoke to the pastor and he also advised me to go for the same 100 days of prayer and fasting. When I did this for 45 days, the Lord answered me at a night vigil at Pentecostal Assembly. In the middle of a prayer for the sick, the Lord spoke directly into my right ear: \u201cI have given you the anointing,\u201d he said. Immediately he said this, my body stopped shaking. I was then caught on the horns of a dilemma. According to the story I was told, Adeboye received his anointing after 100 days of prayer and fasting. If it took him 100 days, why would it take me 45? After ruminating about this, I decided it was better to err on the side of caution. Therefore, I continued fasting and praying. By the very next day of my taking that decision, my body started shaking all over again. On the fifty-fifth day of my fast, the Lord spoke to me again. He said: \u201cFemi, I said I have given you the anointing, why are you still fasting?\u201d I said to him: \u201cBut my body is still shaking?\u201d He insisted: \u201cI have given you the anointing. Why won\u2019t you believe me?\u201d Thereafter, I stopped fasting and my body stopped shaking. So many things happened to me thereafter. My eyes were opened and I started seeing visions. I also started receiving and giving prophecies. My family and church-members became concerned about me. Some people even thought I had gone mad. After one Sunday service, seven people took me to the upper room of Pentecostal Assembly, Yaba, Lagos. They surrounded me and prayed for me. Once they started praying, I became drunk in the Holy Spirit. My cup literally ran over. The feeling was absolutely incredible. I remained very conscious of everything around me, but my body became soft and heavy. The overflow came in the form of tears flowing from my eyes and snot from my nostrils. Validation So many incidents thereafter validated ny anointing. Two examples here should suffice. I was ministering at the fellowship I coordinated when suddenly a lady rushed out. Soon after, someone came in to speak to some women, who also rushed out dramatically. Some thirty minutes later, someone came in again. This time, she walked up to me, interrupting the service. \u201cWe seem to have a crisis on our hands,\u201d she said. \u201cA lady here had an asthma attack. We\u2019ve done all we can to help her. I am afraid the woman is dead.\u201d Dead? I could not believe it. How can somebody die in the middle of a service of all places? What kind of embarrassment was this? The whole church practically moved to the room where she was. There I met the ladies who had apparently spent the last thirty minutes trying to revive her and were now resigned to the inevitable. I knelt down beside this woman\u2019s lifeless body and started to pray. \u201cFather, she will not die but live to declare the works of the Lord in the land of the living. You are the Lord that heals. You took our infirmities and carried away our sicknesses. By your stripes we are healed. You are the Sun of righteousness. Arise with healing in your wings. You are the balm of Gilead. Healing is the children\u2019s bread.\u201d I went on and on, praying every scripture I could think of. After a while, I became exhausted. I did not know what else to say. I was young in ministry and clearly out of my depths. So, I cried to the Lord in my heart. \u201cFather,\u201d I said, \u201cI need help. I don\u2019t even know what to pray any more. I don\u2019t know what other scriptures to claim.\u201d Jehovah-Shammah And then something happened. It was something magical; something glorious. The Lord spoke. I heard him as clear as a bell. \u201cFemi,\u201d he said. \u201cPray in tongues.\u201d That solved the problem. Immediately, I calmed down. I realised I was not alone. The Lord was there. Therefore, I switched to praying in tongues. I prayed and prayed and prayed. And just as suddenly, something happened again. Out of the blue; the woman sneezed. Then she opened her eyes and sat up. Then I helped her to stand up. And everybody went crazy with joy. We went back with her to the service; dancing and singing and shouting and clapping. She sat down calmly in a corner. But the Lord said to me: \u201cAsk her to dance.\u201d So I asked her to join in the dance. To the amazement of all, this woman who had been lifeless for hours, danced with everybody as though nothing had happened. Talitha-kumi Much later, a colleague of ours had a mild stroke. She was rushed to Military Hospital, Onikan, Lagos. We went to see her, rejoicing that it was not too serious. But while there, another drama ensued. A man brought his son for treatment, but he had no money. Therefore, the nurses ignored him. Suddenly, the boy died, right there in his arms. He let out a big cry. My friend, Sandra Chikan, had apparently been observing this drama for some time. \u201cThis man kept pleading with the nurses,\u201d she said. \u201cBut they refused to attend to him. Look now, his son has died.\u201d Without thinking, we descended on the scene. I grabbed the dead child from the arms of his wailing father, and we started to call upon the name of the Lord. We prayed fervently, confident that God is more than able to raise him from the dead. After a while, God honoured our faith. Life flowed back into the boy and he opened his eyes. Rejoicing, we handed him back to his astonished father. At last, the nurses agreed to attend to him. They took him away, still grumbling that the father could not afford to pay. About an hour later, a nurse brought a strange news. \u201cThe boy has died again,\u201d he said contemptuously. Then he stormed out of the room, leaving us with nothing left to do than to console his grieving father. Jesus says: \u201cHeal the sick, cleanse the lepers, raise the dead, cast out demons. You have received freely, freely give.\u201d (Matthew 10:8). Related",

        "title": "Dining with Trump; recalling colonial tactics",
        "author": "Owei Lakemfa",
        "text": "By Owei Lakemfa AMERICAN President Donald Trump sat on Monday, April 30 with Nigerian President Muhammadu Buhari who was on a state visit and told him: \u201cWe had very serious problems with Christians who are being murdered in Nigeria; We are going to be working on that problem very, very hard because we cannot allow that to happen.\u201d Trump was to repeat that line during the visit: \u201c\u2026we are deeply concerned by religious violence in Nigeria, including the burning of churches and killing and persecution of Christians. It\u2019s a horrible story.\u201d President Donald Trump of United States (l) pose while President Muhammadu Buhari signs visitors book at the White House in Washington DC on Monday As there is no religious war in Nigeria, either Trump is dangerously uninformed or he is deliberately playing the religious card which will cause further bloodshed. As if to violently refute President Trump\u2019s claim, within 24 hours of his incendiary claims and needless threats, there were twin bomb blasts at a mosque beside the Gwonjo Market, Adamawa State in which 42 were killed and 68 injured. The perpetrators, as usual, are terrorists of the Boko Haram group who are a hundred per cent Muslim. While there have been killing of Christians in Nigeria including the April 24, 2018 murder of Reverend Fathers Joseph Gor and Felix Tyolaha and several other parishioners of the St. Ignatius Catholic Church, Ukpor-Mbalom, Benue State by suspected Fulani terrorists, the violence in Nigeria is not essentially a religious one. The essential ingredients of the massacres in the country are a mixture of four types of explosives; insurgency, terrorism, banditry and the use of mercenaries, mainly from outside the country to depopulate territories and repopulate them with a different stock. In all four combinations, religion is not a primary ingredient or trigger. In the Boko Haram terrorist campaign, there is no respect for any religious place of worship; mosques and churches are game as are Christians and Muslims. In the case of banditry which is most pronounced in Zamfara State, the perpetrators and victims, are Muslims. In the invasion by mercenaries, the invaders are Muslims mainly of Fulani stock while the victims in the Middle Belt are Christians of a variety of ethnic groups. In the South-East and South-South, the victims of these mercenaries and bandits are Christians, but in the West, the victims are a combination of Christians and Muslims without discrimination. In fact, in many parts of Oyo State, the victims are Muslims. If the American government needed to exert pressure on the Buhari government, it would not be by issuing threats about Christian victims, but a concern about Nigerians being massacred irrespective of their faith. The American pressure ought to be on the Buhari administration to recognise that the perpetrators; be they Kanuris and Ebiras in Boko Haram, Fulanis and herdsmen in the mercenary invasions, Hausas and other ethnic groups in the Zamfara Bandits Movement, are criminals that must be defeated. The pressure to be exerted should be that the Nigerian government recognises insurgency, accepts that it should not be handled with kid gloves and that the future of the country depends on the decisive handling of the insurgents. On the other hand, Trump might be conscious of what he is saying; that he is neither ignorant nor misinformed, but merely playing the religious card. There are strong indicators of this; the American government is usually well informed and has access to good intelligence reports and analysis. Therefore, Trump may deliberately be appealing to his evangelist supporters by holding himself out as the defender of Christians and Christian values not only in the US, but worldwide. This will fit well with his known religious bigotry and anti-Islamic rhetoric which saw him imposing travel ban on travellers from some Muslim countries. He has also played this type of card in the Syrian case in which in January 2017, he directed that greater concession be given Syrian Christian refugees than their Muslim compatriots. The hypothesis of a religious card might not be as farfetched as some may think if only they recall Africa\u2019s colonial experiences. For instance, the British used the religious card to colonise Uganda, considered in the 19th Century, as the \u201cPearl of Africa.\u201d Islam was introduced into Buganda in 1867 and the Muslims were backed by Islamic countries like Turkey. In June, 1877, the British introduced Protestant Christianity through the Church Missionary Society, CMS. The Protestants were backed by the British Empire, while Catholicism, introduced in 1879, was backed by German and French imperialism. In order to win the colonialism contest, and at very minimal costs, the British East African Company brought in a mercenary, Frederick Lugard. His plan was simple; raise false alarm about religious conflicts, play one side against the other, and when the Ugandans might have sufficiently weakened themselves in religious conflicts, introduce the British force to demolish the remnants of the Ugandan military. First, Lugard supplied arms to the Catholics and actually fought on their side to defeat the Muslims. After the victory of the Kabaka Mwanga, Lugard armed the protestants to fight the war-weary Catholics. After Kabaka Mwanga was forced to flee, Lugard got him to sign a Treaty and reinstated him. Under the Treaty, Uganda was carved out into 20 parts; 12 parts for the Protestants, 8 for the Catholics and 2 for the Muslims. When Kabaka Mwanga resisted the balkanisation and mobilised some other groups to join in a coalition, Lugard seized and sent him to exile in Seychelles. The British then signed an \u2018Agreement\u2019 with Mwanga\u2019s infant son, ceding the country to it. It is also not impossible that the American administration is eyeing Nigerian oil which is in the South with Christian populations. Trump who promised to help Nigeria recover $500 million looted funds, spoke condescendingly that \u201cNigeria has a reputation for very massive corruption.\u201d This, he said Buhari is doing something about. He then made a jest about Nigeria\u2019s purchase of American military equipment: \u201cOh, oh. We love helicopters. He (Buhari) likes them more than I do. He likes buying helicopters.\u201d Then added the salesman part: \u201cthey are the best helicopters anywhere in the world. We make the best military equipment in the world.\u201d Trump humoured his guest that \u201cthere\u2019s no country more beautiful than Nigeria\u201d and said firmly: \u201cWe give Nigeria well over one billion dollars in aid every year.\u201d In return, he said Nigeria has to rip \u201cdown those trade barriers\u201d between the countries and allow American goods free flow. If the Buhari government were to give in to the Trump bullying tactics, she might have to brace up for American GMO agriculture products and other goods flooding the Nigerian market and muscling out small scale farmers, producers and industrialists. This is additional to the military equipment the Americans are selling to Nigeria. On balance, Trump seems to be making a profit for American business. Related",

        "title": "Wake up, Nigeria is dying: A reply to my Fulani friends (1)",
        "author": "Obadiah Mailafia",
        "text": "By Obadiah Mailafia ON Friday 11 May, I wrote an article titled, \u201cGenocide, Hegemony and Power in Nigeria\u201d, featuring on the back page of the financial newspaper BusinessDay. In the said article, I sought to explain the ongoing killings being perpetrated by Fulani militias in the Middle Belt. I linked it to the political economy of pastoralism in West Africa. I also argued that part of the problem lay in the fact that in spite of the fact that Fulani make up 41 percent of the population in their original homeland of Guinea, they have never enjoyed political power there. As a consequence, they have turned their attention to Nigeria, which they believe to be their patrimony as of right. President Muhammadu Buhari left being Welcome on his arrival for a two days Working Visit to Bauchi State with him is a Fulani Girl with a Calabash of Cow Milk and the State Governor Mohammed Abubakar in Bauchi Thursday\u2026 File Photo I decried what I believe amounts to ethnic cleansing and genocide in Plateau State, Taraba, Benue, Nasarawa and Southern Kaduna. I not only condemned the killing in unequivocal terms; I defended elder statesman General T. Y. Danjuma when he called upon his embattled people to defend themselves. I took the view that, based on my knowledge as a student of international law, that a people facing an existential threat to their very survival have not only a right but also a bounden duty, to defend themselves and to resort to self-help where the state is unable and/or unwilling to come to their rescue. Predictably, the hordes of long-suffering Middle Belt youths howled with delight while I received angry messages from the Arewa intelligentsia, some of whom I have counted as friends for decades. I received some flak from well-wishers who felt I should not be so direct lest my enemies use it to deny me opportunities for personal advancement. Some of my dearest Hausa-Fulani friends felt dismayed and disappointed by my output. A few expressed anger, if not outright hostility. I am more keenly aware than most that the vocation of public intellectual carries with it a heavy risk. Was it not the philosopher Aristotle who famously declared that a man will have absolutely no enemies only and only if, he does nothing, says nothing and lives as nothing and nobody? Socrates, the greatest of all the philosophers had his life snuffed off him because he dared to say some unpalatable home truths. He was accused of corrupting the youth by questioning the shaky moral foundations upon which the entire architecture of Greek civilisation was uneasily perched. In England Earl Russell was thrown into jail. Nelson Mandela was gaoled for 27 and a half years. In our Nigeria of today those who repeat the lies of the oppressors will be hailed while those who speak truth to power are regarded as traitors or worse. One of the bitterest attacks I have received so far is from a gentleman by the name of Abdullah Musa Abdullah. His piece, Obadiah Mailafiya: Ethnic Intoxication or Religious Bigotry?, was sent to the editors of The Vanguard Newspapers on Friday 18 May. There was a lot that was totally incoherent if not ungenerous, in Mallam Abdullah\u2019s attacks on my person. I shall avoid commenting on the ad hominem attacks because they have no place in the world of intellectual discourse. Indeed, logicians since ancient Athens have consigned ad hominem arguments in the discredited pantheon of logical fallacies. Rather, I shall focus on the gravamen of his critique. In his opening salvo, our friend attacked by sense of objectivity by insisting that objectivity is, by definition, impossible in the world of human beings: \u201cIs it for possible for a human being to be objective, dispassionate? I may be too timid to answer. Many thinkers, writers have expressed as near fact the influence of environment, genetics, beliefs, on human thoughts and actions. Since there is no human being without such influences, we can say that objectivity is a utopian aspiration.\u201d If Mallam Abdullah insists that objectivity as such is an impossible \u201cutopian aspiration\u201d, then perhaps he forgot to include himself in that impossibility theorem. I do not know whether he has ever heard of the Dutch jurist and philosopher Herman Dooyeweerd. He was the world\u2019s greatest authority in the philosophy of mind as it relates to pressupositional thinking. Dooyeweerd insists that all human thought has religious underpinnings. According to him, before we can truly appreciate where a person is coming from we must first dig into the prepositional foundations of his mindset. To that extent, our friend is right. We all have our biases. But then we must not reduce everything to nonsense. All social scientists are expected to spell out their biases from the onset. From there we can move forward on the basis of evidence, facts, statistics, reason and logic. Mathematics and the pure sciences have lesser problems with biases. But even on that score, Thomas Kuhn warned in his famous The Structure of Scientific Revolutions, that biases abound even among scientists. Niels Bohr and Albert Einstein, both of them the greatest physicists of the century, debated endlessly and could not agree on many things. So, the point is taken. But that should not paralyse us to the point of silence. We therefore have to speak, not in the manner of babbling idiots, but sentient, rational beings endowed with Reason and Responsibility. Mallam Abdullah went on to say, and I quote: \u201cDr. Obadiah Mailafiya courted the media after his sojourn as a Deputy Governor of CBN. Whoever courts the media has an objective to achieve. Some fame, some influence.\u201d This statement implies that, after leaving CBN, I somewhere decided to \u201ccourt the media\u201d for ulterior motives. I do not blame Mallam Abdullah. I do not know how young or old he is. I started writing for the newspapers in the late seventies when I was an undergraduate of Ahmadu Bello University. I did some poetic bagatelles as well as amateurish articles for the New Nigerian newspapers as a seventeen year old. Whilst a Research Fellow of the National Institute for Policy and Strategic Studies, NIPSS, Kuru, in my early days, I wrote a number of quite influential articles. One of them was on Sharia, titled, \u201cThe Secular Order and its Enemies\u201d, echoing the great philosopher of science Karl Popper. The article was even quoted by Bishop Matthew Hassan Kukah, now Bishop of Sokoto Diocese, in his doctoral dissertation at London University, now published as a book, Religion, Politics and Power in Northern Nigeria, African Book Collective, 1994. During his field study as a doctoral candidate, Father Kukah, as he then was, drove to NIPSS one day and announced at the gate that he wanted to see \u201cDoctor Mailafia\u201d. The security guards told him there was no such person among the fellows of the institution. One of the wiser ones suggested it might be me. They took him to my house, only for him to find a twenty-three year old junior research officer. We formed a lasting friendship from that day. The point I am making is that, throughout my career, I have always dabbled with newspapers, radio and television. In the eighties, NTA used to pay handsomely for TV appearances. They used to pay for my flights from Heipang Airport in Jos up to Ikeja just to do a one-hour programme. Those were the good old days. I was also a regular writer in The Nigerian Standard and on Plateau Television and Radio. And even when I moved abroad, I was a regular contributor to the newspapers. As a student in Paris, the late super-journalist Dele Giwa wrote me in the summer 1986 to be his anchorman in Paris. A few weeks to my taking up the offer as Paris Correspondent for Newswatch Dele Giwa was killed by a letter bomb. Related",

        "author": "Ochereome Nnanna",
        "text": "By Ochereome Nnanna BEFORE Nigeria became independent, the British colonial masters organised a series of conferences in Ibadan and London to enable the elites of the various regions and socio-cultural divides to negotiate and agree on the terms of their future cohabitation. Since independence in 1960, there have been series of conferences, some of which ended with new constitutional proposals or documents. Let us name them for the benefit and education of our younger readers. After the coup and counter-coup of 1966, there was a conference in Aburi, Ghana, aimed at mending fences between Col. Yakubu Gowon (the Head of State and leader of the Federal Government\u2019s delegation) and Col. Chukwuemeka Odumegwu Ojukwu (the Military Governor of the defunct Eastern Region) in January, 1967. It produced the famous Aburi Accord, which Gowon later backed out of at the behest of senior bureaucrats and Britain, because it would have resulted in a loose federation. This would have enabled Ojukwu\u2019s Eastern Region to become the richest and most powerful federating unit because of the Region\u2019s impending oil power. Gowon, while consolidating his hold on power, caused another conference to be held in Benin later that year, aimed at presenting Ojukwu with a fait accompli to accept Gowon\u2019s totalitarian authority or face the consequences. Ojukwu refused to yield to these hectoring tactics. He insisted on the Aburi Accord, and that was how the slide to war started. Other conferences held in the search for the elusive answer to Nigeria\u2019s national question included: the 49-member Constitution Drafting Committee (CDC) headed by Chief Rotimi Williams and the subsequent Constituent Assembly (CA) led by Dr. Udoma Udo Udoma. These efforts produced the 1979 presidential constitution, which replaced the parliamentary system that was partly blamed for the failure of the First Republic. Military President, General Ibrahim Babangida, during his own convoluted Transition to Civil Rule Programme, empanelled a Constituent Assembly in 1989 in Abuja which also produced a constitution that merely amended that of 1979. It was never put into practice. General Sani Abacha, who overthrew the Interim Government headed by Chief Ernest Shonekan, set up the National Constitutional Conference in Abuja in 1994, with a view to burying the June 1993 election won by Chief MKO Abiola. It also produced a Draft Constitution in 1996, which was never experimented. However, the 1999 Constitution, which General Abdulsalami Abubakar asked the Dr. Clement Ebri panel to produce, merely brushed up the 1979 Constitution, borrowing heavily from new ideas contained in the Abacha constitution. Since that time, two other constitutional talks have been held in Abuja. One was the 2006 event which President Obasanjo had arranged in a failed attempt to obtain a third term for himself. The other one was the recent event organised by former President Goodluck Jonathan in 2014 obviously to increase his chances of getting re-elected in 2015. Few countries in the world have made more attempts to find solutions to their nationality woes than Nigeria. In addition to the search through the constitutional route,forceful military takeovers have been explored. Some coups were bloody. Others were bloodless palace coups. Some succeeded. Others failed. The question is: why is it that in spite of these searches for the perfect fix for Nigerian\u2019s disunity problem the situation gets worse, rather than better? If you want proof that over 55 years after independence and 46 years after the war \u201cto keep Nigeria one\u201d, Nigeria remains one of the most disunited nations on earth, read the reactions to this article below. Read other articles touching on the national question. Most of those tearing at one another are young people born long after the civil war. They were born and nurtured with the diet of mutual, ethno-religious and regional bitter rivalry, and they have produced fruits according to their nurture: hatred, anger, mutual suspicion, ethnic and religious irredentism (\u201cproudly\u201d Igbo; \u201cunapologetically\u201d Yoruba and such asinine bunkum). You can only live your live as you were brought up. Sometimes I wonder how our Hausa, Igbo, Yoruba, Fulani, Christian and Moslem youth of today are going to live in the Nigeria of the next twenty to thirty years if things continue this way! The Bible says that two cannot walk (or work) together unless they agree. Nigeria is like a basket, and Nigerians are like crabs in it. Each of the crabs wants to get out of the basket, but none will allow the other to be able go. Reminds me of the story of the two foolish goats on a precipice. Two sheep demonstrated their usual meekness and cooperation when they met at the centre of the narrow path on the precipice. One bent down to allow the other climb over his back to pass. When it was the turn of two stubborn he-goats, they decided to fight it out and both tumbled down the precipice to their deaths. Crabs in a basket are propelled by the \u201cpull-him-down (PHD)\u201d syndrome. We go to conferences to discuss how to live together peacefully and make our country great. But we go back home and betray everything we agreed to do. I must say, the North is very sadly fond of that. We go to conferences to discuss how to change things for the good of all Nigerians but North (as Gowon did over the Aburi Accord) always goes back to disown anything that would result in a change in the status quo which unduly favours them. Yet the favour bequeathed to them by the British colonial masters has never translated to the North\u2019s progress and development. Instead, we see the multiplication of poverty and destitution among its lower classes, while the upper classes live the lifestyle of kings, nobles, mandarins and oil sheikhs. When we hear of a Nigerian performing a feat, we rush to check if the person is from our tribe. If he/she is from another tribe we are deeply disappointed and we quickly belittle the achievement. If he is from our tribe we boast to others. If it is a criminal act and the person comes from another tribe (especially a \u201crival\u201d tribe, such as Igbos versus Yorubas), come and see insults and venom being traded! Nigerians are experts at derisively profiling one another. When Yorubas were involved in the NADECO struggle, some (especially Igbos) called them \u201ccowards\u201d and dared them to go to war as Igbos did during Biafra. When the Niger Delta agitation started, President Obasanjo and some Northerners called them \u201ccriminals\u201d. Many Northerners asked the military (which they felt was theirs) to \u201clevel the whole place\u201d. When Boko Haram started in the North, some Southerners called Northerners \u201cparasites\u201d who wanted power back so that they would return to their Abacha-style \u201clooting\u201d of the oil wealth of the Niger Delta. And since the Biafra protests started late last year, some Yorubas and Northerners laughed at Daniel Kanu\u2019s supporters, saying they were \u201ccriminals\u201d looking for \u201cmoney\u201d. In all these profiling, little attention is paid to the cry for equity and justice, which are at the centre of all these agitations. Unfortunately, at the helm of affairs today is a leader, President Muhammadu Buhari, who has no regard for equity and justice. All that occupies his mind is to reward those who brought him to power for their years of \u201csuffering\u201d. He sacrifices the sacred principle of Federal Character boldly guaranteed in our constitution to promote national unity, and splits the goodies of governance on the basis of his quaint Formula \u201c97%/5%\u201d which he propounded in Washington DC last year. Let me warn all of us: for as long as we cannot agree we will never walk (or work) together. The search for Great Nigeria will remain chimeric, quixotic, elusive. It will continue till one day, when those who pontificated in our 1999 Constitution that Nigeria is an \u201cindivisible and indissoluble\u201d country will find themselves on their own. Related",

This pattern went on for three days; the coup leaders locked up in Ikeja barracks, with only Gowon shuttling between Ikeja and Lagos city; the flag of secession fluttering over the barracks while the awful killing of Eastern soldiers and civilians went on inside; and more killings going on elsewhere as the Army, last bastion of national unity, tore itself apart.\"</p><p> ----- Frederick Forsyth, former BBC Correspondent and best seller author of \"Emeka\", a biography of Chukwuemeka Odumegwu Ojukwu, Biafra's heroic leader, page 70, published July 1982.</p><p>\"A formal declaration of the Northern Region's secession was narrowly averted Monday August 1, (1966) when Col. Gowon was elevated to power in Lagos. Lt. Col. Gowon had prepared a radio address proclaiming the North's intention to break away from Nigeria but was dissuaded by the Yorubas in the army. Appeals to Gowon for restraint from northern secession were also made by several ambassadors from Western nations, especially Britain. Although Gowon was dissuaded from the secession, he did declare that it seemed to him to be \"no basis for Nigerian unity, which has been so badly rocked, not only once but several times.\"</p><p> ---- New York Times August 3, 1966.</p><p>\"The creation of the 12-states structure by Col. Gowon on May 27, 1967 was an act of expediency aimed primarily at completing their siege of Ndi-Igbo and frustrating their survival and struggle for Self-determination. It dismembered the Igbos as they were split into fragments and put into different non-Igbo states. Thus, there were Ndi-Igbo of Portharcourt, Ahoada, Ikwerre/Etche divisions placed into Rivers State, Ndi-Igbo of Asaba, Aboh and Ika placed in the Mid-West, some other Ndi-Igbo from Azumini and Opobo put in Cross-river state. The rest of Ndi-Igbo were isolated and land-locked into East Central State.

The Western Regional crisis in which unpopular Premier Samuel Ladoke Akintola was undemocratically foisted on the Western Region, mainly Yorubas, by NPC-led Federal government with Tafawa Balewa as Prime Minister and Northern Premier Ahmadu Bello as sectional Party head behind this abuse of political power. Awolowo's incarceration in 1962 on treasonable charges and arbitrary use of the army against its constitutional role to slaughter over 3,000 Tiv ethnic minority in a civil agitation for regional autonomy from the Islamic north which was poised to maintain that hegemony; brazen corruption, nepotism and mismanagement etc led to the January 15, 1966 Coup-de-tat.</p><p>Yakubu Gowon, in conspiracy with other northern officers murdered Major-General J.T.U. Aguiyi-Ironsi, his supreme military commander and Nigeria's head of state and government, former Commander of the United Nations Peace-Keeping Mission in Congo and first African to lead such mission, doing so creditably and excellently. Ironsi, a distinguished career military officer appointed Gowon as army chief. He attained his position by merit untainted by what later became Nigeria's endemic ethnic favouritism that spawned mediocrity and gross incompetence in governance. Yakubu Gowon was a conspiratorial partner to the mass killings of Easterners, particularly Igbos and Eastern Officers and military personnel throughout Nigeria,except the Eastern region, prior to and after the ethno-regional counter coup of July 29, 1966. This genocide led by Gowon and cohorts totally employed the military might of the nation in personnel and equipment, in violation of the protective constitutional role of Nigerian citizens, in the gruesome slaughter of about 100,000 Nigerians of Eastern region extraction. Gowon usurped the powers and position of Commander in Chief of the armed forces and head of state devoid of consensus of regional military leaders, respectively that of Col. Chukwuemeka Odumegwu Ojukwu of the Eastern Region. He appointed himself over and above his superiors in utter disregard of military command structure and hierarchical order. He dismantled the regional governments for a unitary structure for Ironsi's unitary system which unified only the civil service for efficient military command structure and effective administration. Yet Gowon and his group falsely claimed the reason for ousting Ironsi was because he promulgated decree 34 which unified the Nigerian government. In fact he went further to name the structure as federal even as the supposedly federating units were created by Gowon and his military cabal and the old regional units which retained some autonomy, lost them totally. This false accusation against Ironsi was in line with what became all too familiar Nigeria's sinister and false accusations against the Igbo and pronouncing them guilty at all cost to engender mass hatred and hostility toward this group; a pattern that yielded the genocidal epic between 1966 - 1970. Gowon as the military intelligence agent of the British Government aborted the constitutional conference resolutions of September 12, 1966 geared to calm the troubled polity and halt the mass killings of Easterners in Nigeria. He went on to renege on another critical resolution on January 4th and 5th at Aburi, Ghana, after being a signatory to its sensible and collective recommendations meant to usher in peace and reconciliation. Gowon and partner in what later transformed into Africa's worst 20th century war crime of genocide, Obafemi Awolowo, finance and prime minister of war cabinet, usurped ownership and control of Oil resources of South-East and Mid-West Regions to prosecute the genocidal war that cost untold African lives by enforcing blockade against humanitarian aid against Geneva Convention, and its consequent starvation of mainly women and children. Churches, schools, refugee centers, hospitals quartering internally displaced persons with aid agencies that risked flights into Biafra were indiscriminately strafed and bombed. Gowon's slogan was: \"To keep Nigeria one is a task that must be done\" but Gowon in the course of what became a war of attrition, had given away a part of the South-East region, Bakassi, to neighboring Cameroun to hedge the Biafrans who only defended themselves from a cruel and wicked aggression fueled by sheer unjustified ethnic hatred.</p><p>\"the International Committee on the investigation of Crimes of genocide whose investigation included interview of 1,082 people representing the two sides of the conflict concluded thus through its investigator (Dr. Mensah of Ghana); \"Finally, I am of the opinion that in many of the cases cited to me, hatred of the Biafrans and a wish to exterminate them was a foremost motivational factor.\"</p><p> ---- Ohaneze's deposition at Oputa Panel --- Guardian Newspapers  Thursday  July 26, 2006.</p><p>\",,,more than 150 Eastern Ibos slain in rioting in the Northern Region this week.

All of us lived together in harmony not minding the 1966 coup and the subsequent civil war, since most Yoruba parents never reviewed what igbo did to our leaders.</p><p>However, as rightly pointed out by Ochereome Nnanna, the Igbo of southeast started the second fire of disunity in Nigeria, through their utterances and actions during the June 12 debacle. They reduced it to Yoruba affair and aligned with the north. They called us cowards\u201d and dared us to go to war as they did during Biafra. They organised 10m man march in support of Abacha. They  started rushing back to their tribal enclave, thinking that, Yoruba would go to war as they were drumming.They quickly forgot that, Yorubas were born warriors. We had seen wars before them and would therefore never engaged in any further senseless war to kill our people, as the Biafran did in 1967-70.</p><p>Unfortunately for them, they crawled back within six months, after they were robbed by their own people,  dying of hunger and preventable diseases. Yet the Yoruba forgot all these actions of the igbos, accepted them and moved on.</p><p>Then, not too long ago, was the book by Chinua Achebe which tend to open old wounds. Following the book, these group of Igbo started spraying their venom on yoruba nation and the people, many of whom were young and not even knew what happened during the time of Awolowo. The Igbo specifically set up websites to Insult the Yoruba nation at every opportunity.</p><p>I did warn on this forum in 2013 that, the way the Igbos were insulting the Yoruba nation and its people, without being provoked, will attract many other young yoruba lads and those young lads can equally be vicious.</p><p>These subsequent actions of the Igbo pushed many of these young and educated yoruba lads to start making researches and reading books on the relationship between the Yorubas and the Ibos from 1906 to date, the coup and the civil war. Many of us are now well informed. This thus attracted other Young and old Yorubas to to the social media, both at home and in diasporal. Just as I predicted, they started giving Igbo people back what they know how to do best..That is, passing out Insults, denigration and abuse to the Igbo nation and the people.</p><p>Now the die is cast. It has now gotten out of hand. It has degenerated into deep loathe of the Igbos by the Yorubas.  Only a separation can solve the problem. I can not see any further close relationship between the Igbo and the Yorubas, unless God intervene. .And I pray so...</p>",

This pattern went on for three days; the coup leaders locked up in Ikeja barracks, with only Gowon shuttling between Ikeja and Lagos city; the flag of secession fluttering over the barracks while the awful killing of Eastern soldiers and civilians went on inside; and more killings going on elsewhere as the Army, last bastion of national unity, tore itself apart.\"</p><p> ----- Frederick Forsyth, former BBC Correspondent and best seller author of \"Emeka\", a biography of Chukwuemeka Odumegwu Ojukwu, Biafra's heroic leader, page 70, published July 1982.</p><p>\"A formal declaration of the Northern Region's secession was narrowly averted Monday August 1, (1966) when Col. Gowon was elevated to power in Lagos. Lt. Col. Gowon had prepared a radio address proclaiming the North's intention to break away from Nigeria but was dissuaded by the Yorubas in the army. Appeals to Gowon for restraint from northern secession were also made by several ambassadors from Western nations, especially Britain.

Thus, there were Ndi-Igbo of Portharcourt, Ahoada, Ikwerre/Etche divisions placed into Rivers State, Ndi-Igbo of Asaba, Aboh and Ika placed in the Mid-West, some other Ndi-Igbo from Azumini and Opobo put in Cross-river state.

The Western Regional crisis in which unpopular Premier Samuel Ladoke Akintola was undemocratically foisted on the Western Region, mainly Yorubas, by NPC-led Federal government with Tafawa Balewa as Prime Minister and Northern Premier Ahmadu Bello as sectional Party head behind this abuse of political power. Awolowo's incarceration in 1962 on treasonable charges and arbitrary use of the army against its constitutional role to slaughter over 3,000 Tiv ethnic minority in a civil agitation for regional autonomy from the Islamic north which was poised to maintain that hegemony; brazen corruption, nepotism and mismanagement etc led to the January 15, 1966 Coup-de-tat.</p><p>Yakubu Gowon, in conspiracy with other northern officers murdered Major-General J.T.U. Aguiyi-Ironsi, his supreme military commander and Nigeria's head of state and government, former Commander of the United Nations Peace-Keeping Mission in Congo and first African to lead such mission, doing so creditably and excellently. Ironsi, a distinguished career military officer appointed Gowon as army chief. He attained his position by merit untainted by what later became Nigeria's endemic ethnic favouritism that spawned mediocrity and gross incompetence in governance. Yakubu Gowon was a conspiratorial partner to the mass killings of Easterners, particularly Igbos and Eastern Officers and military personnel throughout Nigeria,except the Eastern region, prior to and after the ethno-regional counter coup of July 29, 1966. This genocide led by Gowon and cohorts totally employed the military might of the nation in personnel and equipment, in violation of the protective constitutional role of Nigerian citizens, in the gruesome slaughter of about 100,000 Nigerians of Eastern region extraction. Gowon usurped the powers and position of Commander in Chief of the armed forces and head of state devoid of consensus of regional military leaders, respectively that of Col. Chukwuemeka Odumegwu Ojukwu of the Eastern Region. He appointed himself over and above his superiors in utter disregard of military command structure and hierarchical order. He dismantled the regional governments for a unitary structure for Ironsi's unitary system which unified only the civil service for efficient military command structure and effective administration. Yet Gowon and his group falsely claimed the reason for ousting Ironsi was because he promulgated decree 34 which unified the Nigerian government. In fact he went further to name the structure as federal even as the supposedly federating units were created by Gowon and his military cabal and the old regional units which retained some autonomy, lost them totally. This false accusation against Ironsi was in line with what became all too familiar Nigeria's sinister and false accusations against the Igbo and pronouncing them guilty at all cost to engender mass hatred and hostility toward this group; a pattern that yielded the genocidal epic between 1966 - 1970. Gowon as the military intelligence agent of the British Government aborted the constitutional conference resolutions of September 12, 1966 geared to calm the troubled polity and halt the mass killings of Easterners in Nigeria. He went on to renege on another critical resolution on January 4th and 5th at Aburi, Ghana, after being a signatory to its sensible and collective recommendations meant to usher in peace and reconciliation. Gowon and partner in what later transformed into Africa's worst 20th century war crime of genocide, Obafemi Awolowo, finance and prime minister of war cabinet, usurped ownership and control of Oil resources of South-East and Mid-West Regions to prosecute the genocidal war that cost untold African lives by enforcing blockade against humanitarian aid against Geneva Convention, and its consequent starvation of mainly women and children. Churches, schools, refugee centers, hospitals quartering internally displaced persons with aid agencies that risked flights into Biafra were indiscriminately strafed and bombed. Gowon's slogan was: \"To keep Nigeria one is a task that must be done\" but Gowon in the course of what became a war of attrition, had given away a part of the South-East region, Bakassi, to neighboring Cameroun to hedge the Biafrans who only defended themselves from a cruel and wicked aggression fueled by sheer unjustified ethnic hatred.</p><p>\"the International Committee on the investigation of Crimes of genocide whose investigation included interview of 1,082 people representing the two sides of the conflict concluded thus through its investigator (Dr. Mensah of Ghana); \"Finally, I am of the opinion that in many of the cases cited to me, hatred of the Biafrans and a wish to exterminate them was a foremost motivational factor.\"</p><p> ---- Ohaneze's deposition at Oputa Panel --- Guardian Newspapers  Thursday  July 26, 2006.</p><p>\",,,more than 150 Eastern Ibos slain in rioting in the Northern Region this week.

        "author": "Ochereome Nnanna",
        "text": "By Ochereome Nnanna FOR\u00c2 years, the tragic absurdity persisted. Nobody knows the number of people who lost their lives as a result of it. Someone is shot by his enemies or opportunistic gunmen or is caught in a cross-fire. He is still breathing. Good Samaritans (Nigerians) rush him to the nearest hospital where people who were trained to save lives work. The victim is bleeding profusely. He is desperately pleading to be attended to so as not to die. Those who brought him to the hospital are also begging the medical workers to do something quickly. But all entreaties fall on deaf ears and deadened consciences. The victim is dying and he knows it merely by looking at the amount of blood he is losing. Whenever this kind of scenario crops up the doctors and nurses on duty are afraid to intervene for two major reasons: (a) money and (b) police. A club mate of mine recently told of his shocking experience when he visited a sick relation at a prominent state government-owned health facility in Lagos Island. He said he saw a teenager on the floor in one of the wards twitching and writhing. He was said to be suffering from tetanus infection which he contracted while playing football and stepped on a piece of rusted iron. His young colleagues brought him to the hospital but they had no money to deposit for his treatment. Nobody visited to pay, so no one attended to him. On his enquiry, my friend was told that unless the victim came up with the N3,000 required to treat him his body would simply be deposited in the mortuary when he died. My friend said he quickly paid the said sum, and by the following day when he returned to see his relation, the boy had been discharged, having recovered. On Thursday last week, Mr Gbenga Aruleba, who anchors his Focus Nigeria programme, announced that a young lady, the sole survivor of a road crash, was lying critically ill at the National Hospital, Abuja with severe head injuries. The lady had been in the hospital for five days and had only been given drips and no further medical attention just because no one had come forward to assume financial responsibility for her treatment. How much is a Nigerian citizen really worth? Every other day, our President is flown to any foreign country of his choice for medical check-up and attention on public funds, but the people who supposedly voted him into power cannot even receive first aid in public hospitals unless they pay. There is something wrong with that. In the case of those who come bleeding into an infirmary, medical workers withhold their attention because of police harassment. It came as a great surprise to many that this harassment is not based on any known laws of the land. It was just one of the poorly conceived means of ensuring that criminals wounded in shootouts with police do not escape. Little thought was given to those who might be innocent bystanders or even targets of enemy fire who somehow survived long enough to be taken before doctors and nurses. The recent assassination of Mr Bayo Ohu, a senior editor with The Guardian Newspapers by yet-to-be identified persons, appears to have provided the critical momentum for the abolition of this inhuman practice. The high level of attention the media focused on this tragedy forced the Police to re-empower medical practitioners to treat victims while calling the attention of Police authorities to it. We take consolation in the fact that our colleague did not die in vain after all. His death has become the watershed through which thousands of other lives will be saved in the future. For that we say thank you, Bayo Ohu. May God help you. Journalists should learn a lesson here. Without the publicity given to this tragedy nothing would have happened, just as in the Godwin Agbroko and Abayomi Ogundeji cases. We must keep reminding the authorities of their duties to chase down murderers. We must make murder newsworthy once again. We must return homicide to the front pages. We must stay on them until they are solved. Once we lose interest so will the authorities. Owerri roads in for better times MANY people have been calling my number to complain about the bad state of roads in Owerri, the Imo State capital. I have a number of friends in government there, the most obvious of whom is Chief Pini Jason, who until he accepted to serve in the Ikedi Ohakim government, was an ace columnist with us in Vanguard. I passed on these complaints to him. He assures that the Governor has ordered work to start immediately, even though the earlier plans were to wait for the rains to subside. Let me quote Pini Jason: \"In Owerri Zone, the following roads are under construction: World Bank Umuguma Road (3km on-going); dualisation of Owerri/Orlu Road (4.6km on-going); dualisation of Owerri/Okigwe Road (8.2km on-going); construction/rehabilitation of Shoe Industry-Amaulu-Mbieri-Egbeada-Amauburu old road\u00c2 (16.4 km on-going); construction of internal roads in Area \"S\"\u009d in Umuguma Housing Estate (5.4km on-going); construction/dualisation of Concord/Port Harcourt Road, World Bank Onitsha Road (2.9km on-going) and construction/dualisation of All Seasons Hotel Road (1.5km on-going)\"\u00a6 total roads completed and under construction in just two years, 401.34km. Compare this to a total of 243.81 km from 1999 to May 2007\u2033. My job here is to pass on information between the complainants and the authorities. You be the judge. Related",

        "text": "By Bisi Lawrence When I was told on that Sunday afternoon that Navy Captain Wole Bucknor had passed on, I did not know how to believe it. But I knew that rejection of the information would not change the truth, though that is usually one's first reaction to the unexpected death of someone dear or close to us, or anyone with whom we identify. However, the common outburst of \"What? I can't believe it!\"\u009d is but a trite expression of futile disbelief. The truth is the truth, though it is seldom revealed as a whole picture. That \"partial\"\u009d picture is actually what millions of people received, for instance, with the sudden news of Michael Jackson, \"The King of Pop\"\u009d. His was an existence that was naturally larger than life. It is not given to many people to share more than a slice of that reality; the main, widespread aspect of the superlative artiste obscured so much of it. But, of course, there were millions who related to him and actually thought, or felt, they knew so much of him. Hence the outpouring of universal grief. Some people, on the other hand, chained down to the high ground of morality, would wish to distance themselves from him, though not from his music. Although that aspect, in itself may be enough, it is human blood that drives those legs in the execution of the exclusive dances, and also powers the voice in the rendition of those scintillating songs. You can neither separate the man from his music, nor the melody from its maker. I have known Wole Bucknor for some sixty-five years, since we were at the \"Prep\"\u009d classes of the CMS Grammar School, in Odunlami Street, Lagos. He was not yet ten years old then, but even at that age, he was already a musician \"\u201c yes, much like Michael Jackson. But the tag of a prodigy easily slipped from the shoulders of someone whose mother, two other brothers and several other relatives were all musicians who had started early too \u2026 in a way, also like Michael Jackson. That is not to compare one with the other, but there were slight similarities. However, \"Wole B\"\u009d \"\u201c that was his nickname \"\u201c went on to actually study music like his big brother Femi before him, and with his cousin, Art Alade, and Fela Anikulapo Kuti as his contemporaries. At one time or the other, they all later worked in the Nigerian Broadcasting Corporation at a time when you could still hear good music on local radio, and they found me there. And so, by the way, did another of Wole's cousins, Kofo Bucknor-Akerele, the former Deputy Governor of Lagos State, in whose blood also runs the artistic temperament of a true performer. (She was quite an actress). While Femi stayed with serious music, teaching in the university and conducting the Cathedral choir, Wole steered a middle course, at the same time enjoying his Beethoven, but never losing touch with his Count Basic. He was also very passionate about dance as an art form and once formed a troupe, but he eventually ended up with the Navy where he raised a band that moved military music several paces forward in Nigeria. Well, what really puts the artiste apart from the rest of us? I believe it might be a case of good old temperament. They have to put so much of themselves outside themselves, to come through with delivery. I have known quite a number of them who did not go as far down the road as \"Whacko Jacko\"\u009d but that was because they were perhaps constrained by the implacable norms of the society in which they lived. But then, someone like Fela went the way of Jackson \"\u201c and then some. Son and grandson of a priest, he rejected the idea of God, though he built a shrine to his belief in whatever that was. Quite a number also just managed to stay this side of the fringe. But Wole Bucknor, superb artiste though he was, stayed on the straight and narrow. He attended church service regularly, and we shared the joy of a warm embrace before the Holy Communion, while most people merely shook hands. I shall never forget that. I shall remember several other things too, and thank God for the life of this beautiful man in the way it touched so many of his friends and associates. God rest him. The passing scene changes from one moment to another, affecting our hopes and expectations, creating fresh fears and delights, and revealing new vistas of aspirations and opportunities. Top stories displace one another, headlines replace headlines, and the breaking news, which took our breath away a minute ago, is in no time indeed broken into pieces and discarded as yet another then breaks in its wake. We were very concerned here about the standard of our education last week, particularly with regard to the seemingly shilly-shally attitude of government about the lecturers' efforts to revive its dwindling fortunes. We invited your views and reactions have been pouring in. Here are two or three samples. Adipere, P.G: It is very obvious that Nigerian leaders don't value education, despite having two (former) lecturers occupying the highest offices in the land, our education system still lies in shambles. It is very shameful that we as an independent nation have not been able to equal the standard of education we received from our colonial masters. FG (Federal Government) please settle ASUU before Nigeria is ruined with high crime rate online, due to the increase in the number of idle youths in our streets.\"\u009d Mr. Adipere is so lucid. This indeed is the period when academia should have been strutting up and down with the pride and joy of being \"in government\"\u009d, if not \"in power\"\u009d, with two members of their clan on top of the heap. But it would appear, conversely, that they are hardly in the reckoning in the order of things. Edema Fuludu agrees with that: \"The President, Vice President and the Minister of Education were all former lecturers. So what is their problem with doing what is right with the education sector? I support the strike.\"\u009d Let's read one more reaction this week from someone who agrees though in a modified manner, with the popular view typified by Adipere and Fuludu above. He is part of a very slim minority, but democracy demands that he should be given a hearing too. Agu, B.M. \"I support the struggle for better education in this country, but I don't support the strike again as an option. We are in a democracy. ASUU should mobilize to vote out the Party that fails to support education.\"\u009d Having given B.M. a hearing, he should now lend us his ears. Firstly, he is quite right to characterise what is going on between the universities and the authorities as a \"struggle\"\u009d. That should instruct him about the seriously unhealthy situation into which we have thrust the future of our own country when we have to plunge our education into a strife to improve the development of our youth. If I may borrow a phrase or two from Adipere above, \"the increase of the number of idle youths in our streets\"\u009d is daily contributing to crime now, not just \"online\"\u009d, but also in the streets themselves. Secondly, if Agu has any knowledge of the journey that has brought ASUU this far, he may have to re-define his meaning of \"an option\"\u009d. The synonym of \"option\"\u009d is \"alternative\"\u009d. Haven't all the milestones along that route been put behind us? If all he can offer is based on the premise that \"we are in a democracy\"\u009d, he has got bad news ahead \"\u201c we are not. And so, voting out parties who have no serious commitment of any kind to education, through a system that is patently warped, has got to be a bit of a joke. We will publish more reactions later, not necessarily those which share the declared view of this page, but what we consider genuine echoes of the Nigerian voice. However, that will not include comments devoid of due civility to the principal elements of our government. That would detract from the whole picture of what we are trying to portray in supporting the ASUU position. The great struggle continues, as we stay solidly behind ASUU. Muhammad Reza Sha Pahlavi, Sha of Iran and the last in the line of such titled rulers in \"modern Persia\"\u009d, meant well to a considerable extent, actually. His pace of development and its direction left the people bemused because the structure of the modernisation, which included education and a measure of liberalism, was not based on any strand of tradition or acceptable reference to culture, as his people knew it. His land reforms angered the landed gentry. Foreign interests openly directed the industrialisation he introduced. Thus an uprising of the people toppled his government and replaced it with an Islamic oriented regime of clerics in the 'sixties. Iran must be wondering today how she slipped from autocracy to theocracy. Meanwhile, democracy cries out freedom in the streets, and that is where the citizens have now convened. It took just over a quarter of a million throng to oust Pahlavi from his palace. Half a million still can't touch the incumbent Ayatollah, the head of the Mullahs in charge of the Iran theocracy now. The Chinese have taught the world an awesome lesson in mob control, courtesy of Tianamen Square, when they mowed down hundreds of protesters in 1989. But the Iranians still stayed out there, taking in gulps of tear gas, streaming from the eye and the nose, having forsaken strikes, almighty strikes, as an option. Strike, actually, is not the last option. At one's time of life, be it never said that a breakdown of law and order holds any appeal for us in preference to peaceful change. One has seen the rout of so many uprisings without what could be termed a tangible result. All the same, nothing is settled until it is settled aright, and nothing is going to be offered to anyone anywhere in this Century \"on a platter of gold.\"\u009d Time out. Related",

        "author": "Helen Ovbiagele",
        "text": "By Helen Ovbiagele Many months ago, some of our senators proposed a leisure centre for elderly citizens. The move was applauded by some people, but in the piece I wrote on it, I said it was a good thing that the senators thought of something to put more zest in the lives of the elderly, but that in a country with dismal healthcare like ours, and where the majority of the elderly are poor, it wasn\u2019t a leisure centre that the majority of them need, but rather, qualitative care in all areas of their lives. I added that such leisure centres would normally be sited in the cities and they would cater mostly for the middle and upper classes; in short, the elite. Some readers wrote in to say that I\u2019m a spoilsport and that the idea of a leisure centre for elderly people was good and should be encouraged. Maybe. However, I haven\u2019t heard anything more about the proposed project since then. I probably missed further news on it. Now, since it\u2019s the desire of most human beings to live as long as possible, and this would certainly involve becoming old enough to be regarded an elderly person at a point, it makes sense for our rulers, who I assume would like to live long and become elderly people themselves, to take a good look at the lives of all categories of the elderly people in Nigeria, and do things about their welfare to give them qualitative lives. The elderly we\u2019re talking about here are not those in the upper class of the society who have stashed away enough money and property to have a comfortable evening. Rather, we\u2019re talking about the old people who are poor, and whose children are too poor themselves to take adequate care of their old parents. With the population explosion and hard economic times come high unemployment. So, parents who had staked their all, and even borrowed money to give their wards university education, not only for a better future for them, but as insurance for their own old age as they expect those children to land good jobs when they graduate, and come look after their parents, find to their utter dismay that they have to continue looking after their graduate children because these ones can\u2019t find jobs. File Photo: Aged Pensioners waiting for their entitlement This is a very distressing situation for both parties, as the young people who had thought that a higher education would remove them from the rank of the poor, find themselves still wallowing in the poverty they were trying to escape from. As for their parents, the situation is a nightmare as they continue toiling for the welfare of their graduate adult children. Their distressing state could bring on some serious health problems; further compounding an already bad state of affairs. With prolonged unemployment, a few of them may even die before realizing their dream of seeing their wards land good jobs and come help improve their lives. In a chat with Vista Woman the other week, Dr. Iyabode Cole, a medical doctor who specialized in Geriatric Medicine, and who runs Khadijat Home Care For the Elderly, urged people to give their elderly parents adequate attention and take good care of them; stressing that catering to their needs while they\u2019re alive is of more benefit to them than giving them expensive burials. This is very true, and there could indeed be people who have the means to give their elderly parents a good life, but don\u2019t do so. However, for many Nigerians, their conscience would not permit them to neglect their parents whatever their circumstances, as they have grown up with the notion that one takes care of one\u2019s parents. Migration to the urban areas by young people and high costs of living may be obstacles in the proper care of parents. Unlike before when there were family houses for many people to occupy all the days of their lives, these days, many people can be permanent tenants, especially those working and living away from their home towns, and it\u2019s difficult for many low-income earners in one room to invite their elderly parents to come share it with them and their own family. Besides, they may not be able to provide adequate health care that the elderly may need. Many elderly people may be dying before their time because of inadequate healthcare, and a lack of nutrition. Which is the way forward? Government at the three levels of governance should pay more attention to the care of the elderly. Wherever there\u2019s a State General Hospital or a Federal Specialist Hospital, there should be a department for elderly people, where trained personnel would attend to them. Apart from adequate medical attention which should be free, of course, there should be a nutritionist who would advise them and their relatives on adequate diet for them, which would suit their health conditions. Physiotherapists should advise/help with their exercise routine. Staff there should be professionals who are trained in Geriatric Medicine, and who would treat their patients with respect. Some medical personnel in government hospitals are very rude to their patients, particularly to the poor, the elderly, and also to pregnant women. To the latter, some nurses are particularly vitriolic in their utterances. The elderly need respect, no matter their social status, and the hospital authorities should see that they get this. Also, the local government areas should know the elderly in their wards, through the councillors. Local government is supposed to be close to the grassroots, so, ward by ward, the councillors should know the residents in their area, or, at least the houseowners/chairpersons of the various street associations, and once in a while, they should attend the monthly meetings of these associations in order to know what\u2019s going on in the area. The residents should know where their councillors\u2019 offices are, and his office hours. If things are organized this way, it would be easy to locate the elderly residents and render help when needed. In developped countries, the member of Parliament is very close to the residents in his/her area, and is usually the first to be contacted when there\u2019s a general or even personal problem which needs government\u2019s attention. Regular talks on health and ageing, should be given at the local government headquarters for the elderly and their relations, so that they can be adequately looked after by their families at home, and there should be visits from government health personnel to see how they\u2019re doing. With good cooperation between the government and families, the elderly in our society would feel loved, wanted and well-cared for, irrespective of their social status, and their dusk would be peaceful in spite of the state of their bodies and health.

        "text": "IN a very crude and distasteful publication in the Vanguard, Tabia Princewill, a columnist, displayed a total contempt for the truth and an apparent disrespect for the ethics and the tenets of the noble profession. In an indecent piece titled: \u201cRehabilitating corrupt persons, betraying the Nigerian dream\u201d, Princewill virtually distorted history and invariably discarded the valid and subsisting judgement of the Supreme Court when she gleefully and contemptuously referred to our leader, Chief Olabode George, as an ex-convict! This is the height of criminal libel! How can anyone who pretends an analytical intervention in the public space display a vivid inveterate malice masquerading as journalism? More than a year after the highest court in our land has discharged and totally acquitted Chief Olabode George of any wrong doing in a vigorous and unanimous pronouncement, Princewill has chosen to desecrate the truth and abused the privilege of her position by ventilating a preconceived and disturbing politically motivated vendetta in the public space. This is wrong. This is unacceptable. Concluding passage In conclusion, and once again for record purposes, the Lagos Collectives hereby quote the concluding passage of the Supreme Court judgment that has forever established the innocence and honour of our leader for all times: \u201cIt has been established that the case of the respondent rests on a shifting sand. The charges framed against the appellant in respect of splitting of contracts and disobedience of guideline in Exhibit P3 is unknown to any written law at the material time. They rest on nothing in the face of the provisions of section 36(8) and (12) of the 1999 Constitution. \u201cThey cannot stand as they fall flat. See: Macfoy v. UAC Ltd. (1962) AC 150 at 160. And to cap it, the Prosecution laced the extant charges with intention to defraud, an extra element of the charge which was not proved beyond reasonable doubt. It was a complete mistrial by the lower courts. \u201cI must stop here as nothing useful will be served in moving forward in respect of other issues. The appeal is allowed as same is, no doubt, meritorious. The judgement of the court below is accordingly set aside. The appellant is hereby acquitted and discharged forthwith.\u201d Four Justices of the Supreme Court namely: Mahmud Mohammed, M.S. Muntaka Coomassie, Nwali Sylvester Ngwuta and Kumai Bayang Akaahs, J.S.C., concurred with the lead judgment written by Justice J.A. Fabiyi in this historic unanimous decision that has finally rectified a wrong done to an innocent man. How in the world then does Chief Bode George fit into the garbled analysis of Ms Princewill? Prof. Tejumade Akitoye-Rhodes is Chairman, Lagos Collectives. Related",

        "title": "A bloody Eid gift",
        "author": "Rotimi Fasan",
        "text": "By Rotimi Fasan AT this stage even the most starry-eyed Nigerian must admit that the Nigerian state represented by the government of President Goodluck Jonathan is at the point of capitulating before the terror tactics of the fringe Boko-Haram group. There is no other word for it but that the group now defines its terms of engaging the Nigerian government which seems as lost as ever determining how to respond to Boko-Haram in any way other than with fear. If there is any doubt about this, such must have been erased with the bloody Eid El Kabir \u2018gift\u2019 the group threw in the face of Nigerians from Damaturu in Yobe State. It was a bloody harvest, a massacre of over 150 Nigerians that no government worthy of its name should allow. From execution of security personnel, journalists and persons of different religious orientation, Boko-Haram has graduated to killing Nigerians in their hundreds. And it does so with impunity. But it is like Nigerians expect too much of Abuja these days, even in matters as mundane as providing security for them. There is hardly any other sane way to respond to the idle prattle from Abuja than to hold President Jonathan, the symbol of the administration, responsible for the lame-duck manner government has so far responded to the threats Boko-Haram presents. Nigerians have every justification to question the role of our security agencies in all that has happened so far. To the extent that they have not been able to show any sense of purpose or urgency in taking on Boko Haram, the country\u2019s security hierarchy from the National Security Adviser, Azazi Owoye and the Inspector General of Police, Hafiz Ringim down to the commissioners of police in states so far affected by Boko-Haram activities- all these officers ought to hand in their resignation in the very first instance. Others like heads of the SSS, NIA, etc, should follow suit in due course, but the first set of officers should lead the way. The only reason Nigerians have to demand the resignation of these officials is anchored in the peculiarly Nigerian malady of public officers not recognising when their services are no longer needed or when, indeed, they can longer justify holding on to their positions. Here, it is not the practice for public officers to resign out of a sense that they have failed in the responsibility entrusted to them. They have to be told, in fact, compelled to leave. And it is now in the larger interest of Nigerians to demand and insist on the resignation of the top echelon of the Nigerian security establishment. Other issues concerning the politicians could be settled electorally in the future. A Yoruba proverb says that a deity that cannot improve the lot of its devotees should have the good sense not to worsen it. But it seems the present crop of Nigerian leaders will not recognise it for the indictment it is when outlaw groups begin to tie Nigerians to the stake before live cameras and have them executed extra-judicially. Gradually Boko Haram is forcing us all to conform to the outlaw ethic of its members, no thanks to the vexing and criminal negligence of those with responsibility to protect Nigerians. But rather than admit their failure, if not complicity in the failure of governance- the ineptitude that is creeping into so-called federal administration is nowhere being addressed, the same people who ought to bury their heads in shame are talking loudly. The undue criticism of the US Embassy warning by Azazi Owoye that some highbrow hotels are in the terror-vision of Boko-Haram deserves nothing but scorn. Fighting fire appears the best that one can expect from the security establishment now. No sooner has Boko-Haram struck than the NSA or the IG or their representatives, come out with casualty figures that seek to downplay the gravity of the latest crime. These individuals were out in the wake of the Damaturu attack to counter the Red Cross with casualty figures far less than the one provided by the humanitarian body. When the Police Headquarters came under attack by suicide bombers, the same Police that initially claimed it was a suicide mission would recant within days, claiming thereafter that it was mere explosives that had been set off. But when Boko-Haram responded with a more emphatic attack at the UN House, the cover was blown off what was being hidden. Then did it become clear that both attacks were the work of suicide bombers. Mr. Azazi might be thinking nothing beyond saving his own job when he spoke in the manner he did but the lives of Nigerians who are in fact his employers weigh far more on the scale than his little job. We may need to ask the quality of advice that the President is being provided with by people like the NSA and the IG. If on the other hand, as it is possible, their proposals are not being taken into consideration by the President and others in the political class, these security officers should, as true professionals, resign their appointments. There is no point holding on to a position that portrays you as incompetent. Yet incompetence, mediocrity and indecision appear to be the hallmark of this present administration. Those who look out for what they call solutions in articles like this would do well to look elsewhere because the problem staring us in the face at this present time is not one of lack of appropriate suggestions by way of solutions (there have been many of those here and elsewhere by more competent Nigerians), what is lacking is the will to act, a shameful spinelessness that is bringing Nigerians under the painful shadow of a national disaster. We are redefining our lifestyle and the character of some of our national institutions by the standard dictated by Boko-Haram which can see that it has the upper hand in its fight against this government. In the last NYSC exercise, \u2018endurance trek\u2019 and the passing out parade that are among the defining features of the orientation exercise for corps members were removed. Even the national parade that is a major highlight of our national independence celebration was absent from the menu of events this last October. The celebration itself didn\u2019t go beyond the bounds of Aso Rock Villa- no thanks to threats from Boko-Haram. Clearly lionised and with a larger-than-life image, Boko-Haram now issues random threats which it backs with actions but government cringes in fear and gives the impression that the entire machinery of government is unequal to the crude weaponry and intelligence of a murderous group. This is both shameful and criminal, and some people should and would some day account for this capitulation, the failure to perform their duty by Nigerians. Related",

        "text": "By Kate Henshaw A typical Monday would begin with a morning bell at 5am for the first one and a second time at 5:30am. The jostle for the bathroom would begin. You would even keep a space on the queue so you could take your turn once the person before you had finished having her shower. The senior girls had their separate bathrooms which the juniors would clean and lock up to prevent just anyone going in to shower,but if you had a nice school mother, you could use their bathrooms . Hang your underwear and towel on the line with your name boldly printed, of course, make your bed, get dressed and head for the dining hall for breakfast which could be anything from boiled yam and stew to pap and akara (bean cake). We would then all head to the assembly ground and the headmistress would address us\u2026 any other important information would be passed on and the activities for the week would begin. Off to class we would then go. The first period would go by slowly indeed (at least in our minds, if it was a Monday), then the second one and then it would be break time. If you had enough pocket money to play with, the tuck shop would be the place to show off your wealth so to speak. First break would be for 30 minutes and then back to the classroom for more lessons. Lunch time would come, last period of teachings and then straight to the dormitory to change into your day wear. It was then time to check on your clothes and if dry, bring them in; check on a few friends, do your assignments or just catch some rest before dinner time. If you did not have your complete cutlery which consisted of a knife, fork and spoon, you would not be allowed to eat. The dining hall prefect would go round and keep a watchful eye on those who were not using their cutlery to eat. You must eat with a knife and fork and not a spoon as observed these days when people just use a spoon or fork alone! Fridays were my favourite days especially if the next day was a visiting day. I was quite eager as either my aunty would come laden with home-made meals and more provisions or close friends would invite me to come hang on with them when they had a visit from home if I had no visitors. It was quite heart rendering to watch boarders who did not have anyone to come visit them; they would cry and be miserable for the whole week and nothing would suffice. Home sickness was always brought to the fore at times like these. Life in the house nevertheless was never dull in my book. Weekends were also a time to get your hair done by a friend or you would do a trade by barter for the service. I was quite popular as I could weave, braid or thread. I had my wooden comb for cutting the hair into neat lines, apply either BERGAMOT or DAX hair cream on the scalp and then use the CEILING FAN-make of thread to plait the hair. Sometimes the queue would be so much and at the end of it I would have no one to braid mine so I made sure my hair was done first before I attended to my customers so to speak. Treats in the dormitory were garri soaked in water flavoured with powdered milk and sugar \u2026 delicious indeed. If you were buoyant, you could open up a tin of GEISHA, add a bit of dried pepper from the kitchen, use your boiling ring, boil water in a bowl and make Eba with it and there you had it, Eba with stew. Other times you could make a cone out of paper and then pour in your MILO powder into it, tie up at both ends and leave at the back of your locker for a day or two; bring it out and you peel back the paper to reveal your very own handmade chocolate as it would have congealed together. I think I will try it now once am done writing this article and see if it still works. Cabin biscuits with margarine and sardines was lip smacking too, quite a treat alongside a bottle of chilled soft drink. Punishments for being in the wrong place at the wrong time, being rude to a senior student or just to show the juniors who was boss in the house ranged from cutting grass in a V-shape, cleaning the toilets which would be full of maggots and contents of people\u2019s stomachs and you would have to \u2018pound\u2019 it to be able to flush, scrubbing bathrooms and washing clothes. I hated the toilets! Any other punishment I could stomach,but definitely not that! If you had to miss your meals because you did not finish your punishment on time, that was a killer. You would rely on a friend to then help you sneak a meal back to the dormitory as meals were not allowed to be taken out of the dining hall. Aside from the punishments, the social scene was lovely too as we had the literary week, inter house sports and would get to have a party at the end of it all. I loved the boarding house and I am glad that as I passed through the school, I let it pass through me too. Related",

        "author": "Kate Henshaw",
        "text": "By Kate Henshaw \u201cF rom North, South, East and West we come to FGGC Calabar. With honour and loyalty yield ourselves to thee, to mould and groom. Rolling land of pleasant memories, nursery ground of feminine graces; we adore and make the promise to shine for thee, FGGC\u201d. That was our anthem in school, Federal Government Girls College, Calabar. Wearing our light green shirt/blouse tucked into dark green tunic (JSS1-3) or dark green skirts (SSS1-3), white socks, brown school sandals and a dark green beret will complete the look as we filed out to morning assembly where the principal would address us. We would then depart to our different classrooms for studies with the different teachers each of whom had different characters we either loved or hated. I will come to that later on. In the school, you were either a boarder or a day student. I was a boarder. I was terrified the first day my late aunty dropped me off at school on the first day of my resumption with an enamel bucket for my bath, a bowl for my soap and sponge, a broom, a cutlass and hoe for weeding, two cans of carnation milk, one packet of St Louis sugar, some beverage and cornflakes, my uniforms, bed sheets and other assortments. I was taken to my dormitory which was called Enene House and along with other new entrants; we met with the House mistress and House Prefect and were taken to our bunk beds, given lockers and shown where to keep our boxes. We were given a tour of the house and given the rules and regulations. There were five houses in the school for boarders namely; Enene House (purple), Queen Amina House (green), Moremi House (blue), Remmington House (brown) and Mary Slessor House (red). After classes we would get back to the dormitory and change into our day wear, chat with friends, do our assignments or just chill in the room. I had a school mother (an older student) who looked after me and made sure I was ok. The school was quite big and had a lot of grounds to explore. It had undulating hills, quite a number of building dotted round, lots of green grass and trees all around. If you explored far enough, you would even come across a stream. You could not go round the whole school in a day, it was that big. Enene house was very close to the gate. There were two entrances into the school. The first one took you to the administrative block while the second one gave you access to the boarding houses. The dining hall was situated at the bottom of the hill from where my house was located. Meals were often swapped for a particular preference, for example if I did not feel like eating egusi soup served on a particular day; I would swap it for a meal I loved on another day which would mean a double serving for me. I loved that practice. Weekend meals were a lot better and hardly any boarder missed her meals. It pays to also be nice to the lady in charge of the kitchen as you might just be the beneficiary of extra meat, fish or a bigger portion of food. Provisions in the lockers were reserved for special days so one had to conserve till visiting day arrived and your parents or guardian would bring more provisions so you could replenish your stock. Our teachers each had their quirky characters; Mr Afuekwe had a boisterous and energetic nature and taught physical education. He was also responsible for coming round to the dorms on Saturday mornings as early as 4am and we would be roused from our beds by his persistent blowing on his whistle to go jogging round a pre-arranged route. He was also responsible for training us in volley ball, hockey, badminton, basket ball, long jump, high jump and table tennis. Mr Onyenagiri taught geography (or was it biology), he was soft spoken and had one sleepy eye; Mr idika taught mathematics and he was short with a round pleasant face. Mrs Emesi taught English. She wore glasses and had a slow way of explaining things to you with a gentle voice. Mr Nwametu was our religious studies teacher; he had a strong character and sort of a hard stance about him. Mrs Okon was my house mistress and also taught English. She would make sure you spoke in Queens English each time she interacted with you and would be quick to correct you if you did not. Mrs Otuka or Mem Otuka as she liked to be called taught French and woe betide you if you got your tenses wrong; she would pull your ears or rap on your knuckles with a wooden ruler! Mrs Nwachukwu was always nicely turned out in her outfits and high heeled shoes which you heard pounding the passage to class if she was headed your way. She taught fine art. Mrs Inyangudo was our Vice Principal though she is late now and Mrs Bassey was the Principal. Each and every one of them made an impression in our lives and till this day, anyone who was in my year, still remembers their every nuance. When we do get a chance to meet, which is few and far between, and worse still for me because of my schedule, we always have a laugh and remember the times when we were boarders at Fegocal Base, as we call it. To be continued. Related",

        "author": "Rotimi Fasan",
        "text": "By Rotimi Fasan NIGERIA was again in the news last week for the wrong reasons following the murder of two hostages, Chris McManus and Franco Lamolinara who had been held by Boko Haram for nearly a year. Prior to this, yellow fever had been turned into the subject of a diplomatic spat between Nigeria and South Africa when Pretoria chose to make a mountain out of a mole hill by deporting Nigerians apparently on suspicion that they might spread the disease to Jacob Zuma\u2019s country which treats Nigerians in a peculiarly hostile manner. Nigeria responded in like manner this time around and even got an apology to the bargain. But this wouldn\u2019t do for those who constantly want to be in the news. Like most terrorist groups, Boko Haram covets publicity and would do just about anything to get it. And it would appear that the joint attempt by the British and Nigerian governments to rescue the hostages played into their scheme for publicity and they seized it greedily. It wasn\u2019t meant to end in failure or bring sorrow to the hostages involved but that\u2019s how the entire rescue mission has turned out. Both hostages were workers in an international construction company, Stabilini Visinoni, building a bank in Birnin-Kebbi, Kebbi State, when they were abducted by Boko Haram operatives believed to have links with Al Quaeda. In the fashion of the Osama Bin Ladin group, the Nigerian terrorist group had issued a threatening video in which the two hostages were blindfolded with men garbed in black clothing standing behind them with guns and a sword. This was in December last year, about seven months after the men were first seized on May 12, 2011. The immediate reason for the rescue bid by special forces from Britain and Nigeria was the belief that the men were in immediate danger of being killed. McManus, the British-born engineer (Lamolinara, also an engineer, was Italian) had made an appeal to the British government to accede to the demands of Boko Haram in order to save his life. Much experienced in dealing with terrorists than Nigeria, London must have chosen to follow the norm in the West which is not to give in to terrorist demands except in very rare cases. Accordingly, it ordered a rescue bid, the same commando-style mission that the Americans adopted in killing Osama Bin Ladin some days before Boko Haram struck against Stabilini. The Nigerian mission wasn\u2019t the resounding success that the American had been and the matter was serious enough to elicit comments from Downing Street. David Cameron confirmed the death of the hostages while his Italian counterpart, Mario Monti who did same, is now under fire by his country\u2019s parliamentarians who are aggrieved that Italian special forces had not been involved in the rescue efforts. They are demanding to know the extent of the Monti government\u2019s involvement in the mission if a large section of the Italian public was only getting to know of the death of Lamolinara after the failed rescue bid. No doubt, the Italians are upset as most affected people are in circumstances like this. McManus\u2019 grieving family appear satisfied that the British government did the best it could in the circumstances and are not complaining, only asking to be left alone to mourn in privacy. This is more than the Italian press and their parliamentarians can say for their government. They, it would appear, want to be assured that their government did right by Lamolinara. Although the rescue bid has been presented like a Nigerian affair with the British only providing technical support but insider reports indicate the British actually took the lead role in the rescue effort. Although it hasn\u2019t turned out a total success but the rescue bid was not meant to free the British hostage alone. The complaint by the Italian parliament is intended more, I believe, to show that their government was not just a passive onlooker in a matter that involved an Italian life. In all, it is obvious that London went to great length to free their citizen from Boko Haram murderers. If they didn\u2019t succeed in bringing the men out alive it wasn\u2019t for lack of effort. And let us remember that we are talking here of just two men, even if it\u2019s not all a matter of number. But we are talking here of two Western governments going to great length to demonstrate that they care for their citizens. Since Boko Haram began its renewed effort at making Nigeria unsafe, nobody can confidently give an exact figure of their Nigerian victims. The Madalla Christmas day massacre took many lives, however, the official figure is that 44 Nigerians died. But the circumstances surrounding the massacre indicated many more could have died. How about Kano? The slaughter here was simply crazy and any official or unofficial figure of the dead is a lie. The only thing clear from the massacre is that Nigerians died in their hundreds. Although state officials tried to downplay the casualty figure as they always do, it was obvious people were mangled beyond recognition. Boko Haram has killed Nigerians in their hundreds in single attacks, sometimes a couple of times in as many days and apparently with impunity. Most times what happens is that we all wring our hands in helpless resignation and wait for the next attack. This is where state officials who should take responsibility for arresting the situation are not themselves providing cover for the terrorists or releasing them from detention. President Jonathan may be doing his best but this does not look good enough. He would have to take more strong-arm approach in addressing the matter of Boko Haram. True, he may be limited by technology and necessary know-how in combating terrorists but these are not the only things holding back his effort at addressing the increasing wave of terrorism in the country. He needs to demonstrate more confidence and political will even where he seeks outside assistance as he has obviously done with the Birnin-Kebbi case. He should be seen to be acting and saying more. All we\u2019ve heard from him so far on the present matter is his confirmation that Boko Haram operatives killed the hostages- apparently before the special forces got to them. If the British government could go to the extent they have to free their citizen, even if dead, Nigeria has no business condoning the outrage that allows Boko Haram to run amok across our communities and cities the way it has been doing for long, killing and maiming hundreds at a go and at will. We should show we value human life and will not allow for its destruction. Related",

        "author": "Chioma Gabriel",
        "text": "VP Yemi Osinbajo, SAN By Chioma Gabriel Have you noticed that each time the Acting President is in charge, there is peace across the nation? Killings tend to cease or minimize, herdsmen seem to take a dive and all manner of illegalities are reduced. There is something about a man and the things he controls. It is not the first time it is happening. Osinbajo tends to be the balm of Gilead in this administration. Although he tends to keep quiet when it matters most but those were the times when he was not directly in charge. When things are left in his hands, sanity reigns. If you ask me, I\u2019d say Buhari wouldn\u2019t have gotten a better man. I am not insinuating anything. On several occasions,Osinbajo had stepped in in an acting capacity and he never disappointed Nigerians. Besides, he allways remains loyal to his boss the president. When you look at how the ex DSS boss, Daura\u2019s matter was handled, you\u2019d notice that the VP must have decided that cabal or no cabal, he would no longer suffer fools gladly. There is peace, not the peace of the grave yard and Nigerians were happy with his decision. Each time the president travels out of the country, there\u2019s always controversy over his health and each time, the presidency always tries to assure Nigerians that all is well. Even when thepresident travels for other things, Nigerians tend to associate his travels with his health. Indeed, President Buhari\u2019s occasional travels have always created a yearning for an alternative and Osinbajo often fits in. Nigerians are worried about the age and the health of the president and think he needs more rest. And each time he hands over to Vice President Yemi Osinbajo, Nigerians tend to compare their times and the verdict has always been that Osinbajo performs very well. Some of those making comparisons would say things were always better in the country whenever Buhari travelled. Many would say that stress might be taking a toll on Buhari and the system works better whenever Osinabjo is in charge. Although Osinbajo has his excesses, he appears calm and calculative in tackling Nigerian issues. Believe it or not, the vice president always tries his best in ensuring that the country remained stable despite the rancour caused by the absence of the president. The vice president tends to relate better with Nigerians. He is a man who can travel anywhere without fear of any kind in portrayal of the fact that his conscience is clear. After he sacked the DSS boss, he visited Katsina and the people welcomed him warmly. They didn\u2019t take it out on him that he sacked their son. Pebbles and sachets of water were not thrown at his convoy. The sack of Daura was not ethnicized or religionised. Ofcourse, Osinbajo is younger, more agile, physically stronger and more charismatic. He appeals to Nigerians. As 2019 approaches, it becomes more obvious that Nigerians are tired of being ruled by leaders who ought to have retired, especially those being recycled over and over. Anytime the president travels out, some sort of rumour is always spread about his health. Buhari\u2019s age often makes Nigerians think there is something wrong with him even when he is well and whenever Osinbajo is in charge as acting president, there is calm and Nigerians tend to have total faith in him. Nigerians are looking for a president that will be able to stand on his own without being supported. A man like Osinbajo has not disappointed Nigerians on this note. Overtime, he has won the hearts of the people. When Buhari seemed to be avoiding going to the Niger Delta region, it was Osinbajo who visited Niger Delta for peace talks and doused the tension in the region. He succeeded in changing the impression of the people who think the government is ignoring them while laying their natural resources to ruin. Whenever he is in charge, Osinbajo moved round the nation more. He knows about the situation in the states and has endeared himself to the people by visiting the states within the country. He knows how to handle the masses and the people have discovered he has a unique manner of approach that restores calmness to an aggrieved people by speaking to them. He has the gift of the garb and Nigerians tend to mellow whenever he speaks. So,what do you then say of these things: \u201cwhen the righteous are in authority, the people rejoice; but when the wicked beareth rule, the people mourn.(Proverb 29:2) Related",

        "title": "A brief note on the condition of rural areas in Nigeria",
        "author": "Douglas Anele",
        "text": "By Douglas Anele When Maryam Babangida, the late spouse of former military dictator, Ibrahim Badamasi Babangida, launched the programme called Better Life for Rural Women in the 1980s, many na\u00efve Nigerians, particularly women, thought that the scheme would bring a new lease of life to rural women who were usually neglected by the three tiers of government. Moreover, several sycophants of the government, including \u2018respected\u2019 Nigerians with pompous, highfalutin, academic and professional titles, hailed the initiative as a game-changer that can radically transform and empower women in the villages. But more discerning Nigerians saw the programme as another scam by the ruling class to further despoil the people. It turned out the critics were right, because the scheme was highjacked by the wives and mistresses of prominent membersof the ruling and business elite for their narrow selfish interests. An initiative allegedly motivated by \u201chumane motherly considerations for the rural poor\u201d from the former first lady turned into an avenue for satiating the bulimic appetite of prominent Nigerians, because the hundreds of millions of naira purportedly spent on the scheme enriched a select few whereas rural women who ought to benefit from it were ignored. This point can be generalised: till date virtually all federal government initiatives targeted at improving the lives of rural dwellers have failed due to poor planning, corruption and avarice by government officials and their collaborators. Therefore, it is not surprising that the countryside nationwide has remained rustic and undeveloped all these years inspite of rural development programmes launched with fanfare by different administrations in the country. Now, the Yuletide holidays which I spent in the village made me acutely awareof some important but often neglected issues which deserve serious attention from government. Generally, the level of government presence in rural areas is abysmally low, creating the erroneous impression that rural dwellers are second class citizens who do not deserve modern amenities that make life more comfortable. For example, epileptic electricity supply which is a general problem in Nigeria is worse in the villages. Typically, in a month, electricity may be available only for twenty four hours cumulatively, a situation that makes life in the rural areas difficult and unattractive to the youths.Most rural dwellers are so poor that they cannot afford even the cheapest generating sets to illuminate their homes at night. Lack of motorable roads and portable water supply is a serious problem in the rural areas. Because of inadequate road network, many farmers go through hell to evacuate their farm produce from the farms. In my hometown and most villages in Imo State, people still fetch water from streams for their domestic use. Little wonder, then, that water-borne diseases are still causing premature deaths in the countryside. Another point is the near-total absence of industries \u2013 small, medium or large scale. Absence of industries and lack of social amenities are the main reasonswhy young men and women abandon the villages in search of livelihood in the urban centres. Clearly, the lopsided demographic configuration of our villages is a serious matter. In a typical Nigerian village, majority of the population comprises old people who are mostly economically unproductive and actually depend on their children and relationsfor survival. Due to physical and mental infirmities brought about by ageing and ill health, such people cannot contribute much to the development of their villages. And since the youths, especially in Igboland,that could have done so have gone to the towns in search of employment and better life and return to their bases after Christmas celebrations, the rural areas sink into a condition of existential hibernation by middle of January until the Yuletide comes again. Farming, which is the linchpin of rural economy, has been neglected by local governments. Even in areas where agricultural productivity has improved through modern farming methods, the bulk of what is produced is sold in the towns, giving rise to the awkward situation in which prices of foodstuffs are generally higher in the rural areas than in the urban centres. Again, chronic lack of modern storage and food processing facilities and efficient transportation leads to wastage of a significant percentage of farm produce. Clearly, the local government system was created, as the clich\u00e9 says, \u201cto bring government closer to the people.\u201d However, due to corruption and structural anomalies in local government administration and finance, the third tier of government cannot effectively tackle the problems of poverty and underdevelopment in the rural areas. Besides, subordination of local governments to state governments in the 1999 constitution constitutes a formidable stumbling block preventing authorities at the grassroots level from actualising the mandate for which local governments are created in the first instance. That life in the rural areas is hard, rustic and sometimes inhuman cannot be overemphasised. Many rural dwellers are traumatised by poverty, starvation and diseases. The major problem is that political office holders are alienated from the grassroots, from the people they are supposed to serve. As a result, they do not really understand the enormity of thesufferings experienced by rural dwellers on a daily basis. Ideally, democracy is government of the people, by the people and for the people. But our own version of democracy is light years away from the ideal, because what we have now is kakistocracy. But no matter how bad the system is, particularly with the rising tide of insecurity and insularity of the ruling class to the sufferings of our people, Nigerians should not give up hope. They should continue to work hard for an egalitarians society that pays serious attention to the problems of human beings no matter where they are domiciled. On a more personal level, I call on Rochas Okorocha, governor of Imo State, to pay close attention to the villages and do more than his predecessors to alleviate the problems of rural dwellers. When I was in the village, virtually everyone I spoke withpraised him for his performance, despite the lean financial resources of the state and distraction from the Peoples Democratic Party in Imo challenging his election. The best way for Okorocha to create an enduring legacy for himself is by massive development of the rural areas. Related",

        "author": "Onochie Anibeze",
        "text": "By Onochie Anibeze Open letter to The Senate President Your Excellency, A CALL FOR A TRUCE OR KESHI\u2019S RESIGNATION I have decided to draw your attention to the issues between Stephen Keshi, the Super Eagles coach and his employers, the Nigeria Football Federation. I do so for the interest of our football especially the 2014 World Cup campaign. Nigerians follow your tremendous interest and support for our sports. I hope that you would intervene immediately and resolve the issues so that we can move on and pursue the World Cup qualification in high spirit. David Mark and This letter should have been to the attention of President Goodluck Jonathan but I know that you are closer to sports and you will act promptly, being a sports man yourself. Sir, the NFF is bitter that after they toiled to assist the Super Eagles to win the Nations Cup they got no credit for the victory in South Africa. Rather, they were discredited, bashed here and there for harassing and disrespecting Keshi during the competition. A little background to the problem may help. The Federation called a meeting after the first two matches which ended in draws in South Africa and told Keshi that earning two points out of six was a failure. Keshi flared up and told them that he was ready to quit and that they could give him his return ticket. He did so not because of their fair presentation but because he was agitated before the meeting. He was angry. He had it on good authority that discussions to sack him and engage a foreign coach were on. NFF President, Aminu Maigari was not in the meeting but he had once told Keshi that the Zambian coach appeared a good coach to him. This triggered the rumour that the NFF had actually approached the Zambian coach. Keshi was unsettled. He was said to be all nerves as he went on with his job during those early stages of the Nations Cup. Truly, there was a move to disengaging him. But that did not even start at the Nations Cup. It started in Nigeria. But NFF President, Aminu Maigari resisted that. He said that Keshi had not failed and that it would, therefore, be wrong to engage a foreign coach. President Goodluck Jonathan had expressed a strong desire to see the national team strong again. He even visited the team when they camped in Abuja. The sports ministry did not want to disappoint Mr. President and they told Maigari \u2018\u2019if it\u2019s a foreign coach that we need to win the Nations Cup, let\u2019s hire one now.\u2019\u2019 That was before the Nations Cup. Maigari saw no reason in that and argued that Keshi should be allowed to continue his work. But the rumour on foreign coach had spread and was affecting the concentration of Keshi even before the Nations Cup. It was so bad that on one occasion Maigari encouraged Keshi to disregard all rumours and go on with his job, reminding Keshi how he was chosen as Eagles coach. A foreign coach was on the card after Samson Siasia was sacked. But Maigari insisted on Keshi and he got the job. Few months before the Nations Cup, while the sports ministry nursed the idea of a foreign coach, Maigari asked Keshi to damn every move for a foreign coach with results. \u2018\u2019I don\u2019t talk much. I allow results to speak for me. Keshi should adopt the same attitude. If he has good results how can anybody make a case for a foreign coach,?\u2019\u2019 Maigari told this reporter in a chat we published as news. Keshi got the message and that calmed some nerves then. You could, therefore, imagine how Maigari felt when he heard that Keshi was accusing him of championing the case for a foreign coach. He felt stabbed in the back. But the truth remains that some people actually bought the idea of a foreign coach after the first two matches with Burkina Faso and Zambia that ended 1-1, with the Eagles conceding late equalizers. And after the Nations Cup, Keshi opened up to a radio station in South Africa and spoke of his possible resignation. He told the media after the Nations Cup victory that he was not sure that he would remain the Super Eagles coach since Nigeria did not want him. This drew outrage against the federation and while millions of Nigerians congratulated the team, they cast aspersions on the federation. Bitterness set in. During the Presidential reception in Abuja and the other receptions held for the team in other states, the players and coaches were rewarded with plots of land and money. Members of the federation yawned to be included. It did not happen. Envy set in although this could not be said for all of them. The federation drew a line between them and Keshi. And today, the bad blood is getting thicker. They said Keshi did not attend a meeting in Abuja but had time to go to Lagos to take delivery of cars given to him by Globacom Chairman, Chief Mike Adenuga. The federation is angry and disappointed that Keshi portrayed them in bad light. Keshi was equally disappointed in South Africa and told the world the anguish that the federation caused him before success was achieved. He had to manage not only his players but also the coaches and backroom staff some of who did not help the team by running some people down by gossiping and feeding the leadership of the federation with lies and cooked up stories. The bonuses of two of his coaches, Sylvanus Okpala and Valere Houndanou, were slashed by 50 percent on the grounds of paucity of funds at the time. This was enough to upset the technical crew but Keshi managed it well and assured the coaches that the balance would be paid when the federation got their allocation from the National Sports commission. But it never happened and the coaches kept on working diligently. Okpala complained to board members but nothing happened. He then decided to call Nigeria and inform Patrick Ekeji who was still the Director General of the NSC. He said he had to do so since there were no clues within the federation. That infuriated the leadership of the federation and he was queried for taking an internal matter to NSC. He was directed to reply within 24 hours. The query was written on February 2 but given to Okpala on February 8. Slashing match bonus of assistant coaches and querying one of them two days to the Nations Cup final on February 10? Keshi concluded that they wanted him to fail. But he strongly held his team together and commended Okpala for remaining calm and focused during those trying times. Okpala, in his reply to the query, said that he needed time to concentrate on the final match and that he had consulted his lawyer. But shortly after that he added more details, explaining that he reported the slashing of his bonus to Ekeji because the NSC was the supervising body and that Ekeji was his team mate in the Green Eagles whom he felt could help him. He also stated that since he was given the job, his bonuses were always paid accordingly until the Nations Cup in South Africa. He said that the federation was yet to explain to him or his head coach, Keshi, why they slashed his bonuses by 50 per cent. Copies of his detailed reply were given to Emeka Inyama, Chief Mike Umeh, Deji Tinubu among others who are all board members of the federation. But his explanation meant nothing to the leadership of the federation who have now formally disengaged him as one of the assistant coaches in the Eagles. Before now, they wanted Keshi to fire Okpala by telling him that Okpala claimed that his contributions to the team\u2019s success were immense and perhaps more than his. They expected Keshi to take offence but Keshi understood the gimmick that was meant to knock their heads. His reply disarmed everybody. \u201cIf Okpala said he was the one behind our success that\u2019s good, that\u2019s why I chose him to assist me.\u201d But Keshi knew Okpala never said such a thing. It was all part of the gossip culture that he was contending with in the team. Sir, kindly permit me to recall this briefly. Sylvanus Okpala was once the captain of the Flying Eagles who started playing for Enugu Rangers as a secondary School student. At 20, he was already in the then Green Eagles and was a member of the victorious 1980 Nations Cup team. He also once captained the Green Eagles. He left Nigeria in 1982 for professional football in Europe where he played for Unao, Maritimo and Nacional in Portugal before returning home to resettle. He played as both attacking and defensive midfielder before coach Otto Gloria of Brazil converted him to the full back position where his mesmerising and overlapping runs earned him the sobriquet, Quicksilver. He was a great player. Some board members today don\u2019t know the track record of this man. Okpala bagged the National Honour of MON after the 1980 Nations Cup and OON after the feat in South Africa. He deserves better treatment than what the federation has meted out to him. He was sacked without the consent of Keshi who selected him to work with him. It is wrong. But this is not only about Okpala. It is more about Keshi, our Eagles and the leadership of the Federation. I would like you to call for a truce so that we can present a united force in our 2014 World Cup campaign. Everybody meant well but unfortunately their actions were misconstrued. The ministry wanted Eagles to win and started the campaign for a foreign coach. Maigari doesn\u2019t talk much and his silence was misconstrued as consent for a foreign coach. Keshi said that one of the things that hurt him badly was the booking of their flight back to Nigeria before they played Ivory Coast. It gave the impression that those he worked for didn\u2019t believe in him. He was rightly disappointed. Okpala probably did not know about the issues between Ekeji and the Maigari board before reporting his case to Ekeji. This aggravated his case before the leadership of the federation. He may be forgiven. We need a truce to move on peacefully otherwise Keshi should be advised to resign. This is because the federation is so bitter that he may not enjoy their support any more and what will suffer will be our football and not Keshi. If a coach doesn\u2019t have the support of his federation he will likely fail. But I know that you can help Nigeria manage the success of the 2013 Nations Cup and the road to the 2014 World Cup. Sir, kindly intervene, make all to see reason to work together to qualify for the World Cup and go and do well in Brazill. I am hopeful that your action will help our football. Thank you and May God bless you as I await your quick intervention, sir. Related",

        "author": "Paul Bassey",
        "text": "By Paul Bassey For the past two weeks, my phone has been the recipient of a lot of calls from abroad. The most guilty are the journalists from Sweden in search of up dates on their country man who has been given an opportunity to coach a World Cup team. In one instance, I asked the caller why he does not talk to Lagerback directly. I advised that it would be cheaper and more authoritative if he could speak to his compatriot instead of relying on hearsay from somebody outside the corridors of the Glass House. He said Lagerback was nowhere to be found, that besides he does not talk to them freely about the Nigerian job. One of them, Bjorn Kirsten (Something like that) even said Lagerback had once joked that Nigerian stories change per minute and that it will be wise for them to relate with their Nigerian counterparts. \"Per minute what?\"\u009d I queried. He said they had once quoted the coach copiously on a friendly match, made airline bookings to cover same only to find out that the match had been cancelled without adequate information. Then came the South Africans as the news of the Hampshire Hotel hit front pages in the Nigerian sports media. The case of the South Africans was amusing because even when they had information at their finger tips, under their noses, they still wanted to \"confirm\"\u009d issues that they believed were out of this world. Why should Nigeria for instance pay as much as US$125,000 for a contract she claimed she did not enter into? How was it possible for the NFF to convince FIFA to accept a camp base that was not listed by them? When they asked whether the fine would be deducted from the FIFA allocation to the NFF, I replied that it was the government that would foot the bill and they sought to know why. The calls are still coming in, only this time from a most unlikely source, Argentina. Yes, Buenos Aires in Argentina. Speaking through an interpreter, the journalist wanted to get details about coach Lagerback. I gave him the little I knew. He then asked about Nigeria's pre-World Cup programme and I said I had no idea. He did not take it kindly. How come I did not know our World Cup programme? He was ready to give me that of Argentina. I insisted I did not know. He did not believe me. Ok, if Nigeria's World Cup opening match was like tomorrow, who are the players Lagerback was likely to field? I said I did not know. He then reframed the question. \"As a top sports journalist in Nigeria, can you give me your likely starting eleven? Not Lagerback's, your own\"\u009d. He could hear me laugh. I said to him that between the Nations Cup and now, so much has happened that there was even no team in sight. I said whether he believed me or not, there was no team on the ground. That immediately after the World Cup, I would have been tempted to include players like Yobo and Mikel in my starting line up, but that while Yobo is struggling to recover from injury, Mikel is suffering and the likelihood of them attaining full fitness level before the World Cup was in the hands of soccer gods. I cited Danny Shittu, the heavyweight of a defender who was a regular in Angola but who since then has not kicked a ball. I talked about the absence of a traditional striker in the mould of Rooney, Ribery and Higuain. What about lethal midfielders like Messi, Ronaldo, Lampard and Robben? All this while, the Argentinian journalist was not with me. He told the interpreter to tell me that he was not impressed that I had misunderstood him. He was not telling me to reveal any secret. That in football, the mere mention of players does not amount to anything. I quote him \"\"\u00a6.. For instance, everybody in the world knows that Messi will play against Nigeria. That Higuain and Carlos Tevez will feature does not mean that the Argentinian team has been exposed. Or, are we to say that Messi should stop playing so that the Nigerian coach and Nigerian people do not see him play? \"Football is not like that, that is why every week, Messi can afford to score goals despite the extra attention accorded him by the world's top defenders.\"\u009d Again I laughed I told him that I appreciate and knew all he has said, that it was difficult for him to believe me was understandable. But as a professional colleague I was giving him my word that I knew absolutely nothing about the Super Eagles World Cup team. I then proposed some information on the players I knew will definitely be at the World Cup. \"How many of them?\"\u009d he asked. I started counting\"\u00a6\"\u00a6Osaze, Enyeama, Mikel, Ike Uche, maybe Aiyegbeni, Taiwo, Kalu Uche, Obafemi\"\u00a6\"\u00a6\"\u00a6\"\u00a6. I must have paused for a long time because he now interjected. \"Maybe you think I am a spy. That I am in the process of getting information for my country\"\u00a6\"\u00a6..\"\u009d I stopped him. \"What information can you get? Are you not the one who just told me that even if I mention a player it is of no effect since he may be playing weekly for his club?\"\u009d He said \"yes\"\u009d. That he will be in South Africa solely to cover Argentina. That his World Cup stay in the African country is dependent on how far Argentina will go \" \"\u00a6.should they leave in the first round, I leave with them. \"Before the World Cup I am to do series of features on them and their group. It is expected that before the World Cup I would have been an expert not only on Argentinian football, but also of Nigeria, Greece and South Korea. \"I am to also go further and do a research on likely second round opponents and so on till perhaps the final. You can now see why you have not been of any help to me\"\u009d he literarily cried. He now asked me to please give him the name of any other journalist that could help him since I was not ready \"to cooperate\"\u009d I told him I could not think of any journalist\u00c2 that fits his bill. He hung up. I then sat back and felt bad that he had not believed me. I wished I had given him the phone number of Chief Taiwo Ogunjobi! Sincerely, who knows about our World Cup proramme and team? Who? Because I want to call Ricardo back and make amends. See you next week. Related",

        "author": "Onochie Anibeze",
        "text": "By Onochie Anibeze Last week, I asked readers to react on the cheating in age grade competitions as was highlighted by ex international Adokiye Amiesimaka in his comment in Vanguard two weeks ago. Astute sports journalist Mitchell Obi called to bare his mind this way: \u201cI have just finished reading you. There\u2019s something that we are missing in the champaign against cheating in junior competitions. The emphasis should be in the U-17 category, not U-20 and the Olympic team. I say so because at 20 a boy is already a man and can play for the senior team. It is the age of maturity in sports. If you are 25 and claim to be 20, the difference in output in a team sport may not be significant. You may not be able to muscle a strong 20 year-old. It is not so at U-17 where the youth is just growing and full of exuberance. A 25 year-old can muscle a 17 year old. That\u2019s why FIFA is more concerned in cheating at U-17 than in other age categories upward. But the point you people are not making is that the players who cheat at the end of the day cheat themselves. If a player who is about 25 claims that he is 15 or 16 and plays for U-17 team and shines and gets signed up by a club abroad, he will be sent to the junior team of that club as he cannot sign professional contract until he is 17 or above. It means that he may be getting professional contract at his real age of 27 or 28. How many years will he then put in when at 30 he is supposed to be planning his retirement? When all expect fire, some kind of high performance from the player based on his passport age and his performance begins to dwindle the world will know that he has lied about his age. By telling lies on his age and not getting professional contract in time the player has shortened the span of his career. So who loses? This has happened to many of our players. Those who lie at U-17 cheat themselves and that\u2019s where our emphasis against cheating should be.\u201d Another reader who is close to me took time to explain to me why we may not achieve much on the champaign against cheating: \u201cOnochie, did you read the same Adokiey\u2019s comments in your paper on line? Did you not see that most of the readers attacked him for condemning our team? People even felt that he was not patriotic. You wonder what is patriotism. The problem is that cheating has become part of us. The civil servants lower their ages so that they can last long in service. People generally lie about their ages, so players should not be singled out for condemnation. It is all part of the corruption that we see in public and private offices, in our lives. It is a national problem. Don\u2019t Nigerians cheat in elections, in businesses, in contract awards, in selling and buying, in our homes, in everything? That\u2019s why some people feel that you people in sports are being noisy about a common thing in our society. It is bad that people feel that way but that\u2019s the truth about Nigeria.\u201d The speaker was calm and picked her words slowly apparently for emphasis. Did it dawn on me that we are in trouble? Please read other reactions: Onochie, I read your column in today\u2019s Vanguard. I want to associate myself with observations and comments made by Adokiye Amiesimaka and Dr. Ken Anugweje. Of course we should discourage cash prizes to players of Under-17. Also, any player featuring in the Premier League or aborad shouldn\u2019t be allowed to be part of U-17 and U-20 national teams. The NFF and government should be fully encouraged to stick to this as a development programme for the next five years. Government and Nigerians should not condemn NFF and players for not wining trophies. \u2014 Sani Toro (Former NFA Scribe). \u2022 As long as our administrators and footballers remain Nigerians there\u2019s no way that cheating in age competitions will stop. Nigerians must always cut corners in anything they are involved. Please, don\u2019t publish my particulars. \u2022 Re: Did you read Adokiye Amiesimaka? Sports writers and some ex-internationals particularly Odegbami and Adokiye have said a lot on this over age issue but NFF will always want to play a smart one on Nigerians by looking for overaged, baby -face players for age-group competitions. If various clubs/academies are to submit bio-data of invited players this will help to check cheating. Dike should be sanctioned for Nwafor\u2019s invitation. NFF Secretariat also stand accused. Omogero \u2014 08056439015 When truth is said at a wrong time it is wrong. Amiesimaka does not see other tribes in that team? Also you, Onochie, was Stanley the only man in that team? To be a good writer is not destroying your brother on pages of newspaper. Sunday Uzo, 08058581713 My brother Onochie, I read your piece and I agree with everything but not with the issue of monetary reward. An Ajegunle boy in a killer country who has toiled for over 10 years to get a break in his football, a boy who must have paid coaches and agents to make a big tournament, person wey don plan a tour through the Sahara to Malta or Libya or Wiava, you say make him collect gold wristwatch? Common Onochie, this is still a very poor country with basic things still a big deal. We are not a first world like Spain. The administrators, coaches, you and I know the overaged players. But let\u2019s not deny the poor guys their due. Steve Osuji, 08033124151 Dike opened his mouth in self-adoration without knowing he was opening can of worms. I believe 99 per cent of our guys in that tournament are above 25 years, not even 20 years. I think it\u2019s high time we enacted law making it a crime for parents, their wards and coaches to field overaged players in tournaments. I\u2019m ashamed of both the coaches and players. 08093039911 Concerning your piece, I want to make it clear that Africans don\u2019t use their real ages in anything they do. Please can you tell me the real age of Sam Okon Peter, the boxer? He may be 50 or even the age of our president. We are suffering it as a country. They will keep on collecting the punches. Celestine Ogbonna, Abuja 08099122217 The way Ajagun dribbled past defenders for Dolphin once made me ask coach Eguma where he got the player from. He said he got him from Cruzeiro of Kaduna after one FA Cup tie. That was in 2008. The guy later played for U-17 and now U-20. Adokiye is right. Na PH we day. From FCA \u2014 08037045943 Related",

        "author": "Bisi Lawrence",
        "text": "By Bisi Lawrence *legacy of a conflict? *perfidy in high places *great iwu Some people now say what is going on in the Niger Delta is NOT war. They say it out, loud and clear. It sent me post haste to the meaning of war as described in the dictionary: \"armed fighting between states, countries, or factions.\"\u009d There is armed fighting going on between forces of the Federal Government of Nigeria and dissidents in the Niger Delta under various names and titles. What else can we call that but war? It seems to me an irresponsible attempt to trivialize a very serious situation in a most callous manner. People, Nigerians, are dying by their own hands. Other people are spending sleepless nights looking for a solution, but some others deny the patent horror and pain of this most unfortunate incident unfolding daily right before our eyes. What kind of people are we? The first (and, thank goodness, the only) time I heard the discharge of military weapons at close quarters was at an exercise \"\u201d an exercise, mind you, not at the warfront \"\u201c I got wet between the legs. I do not like wars, not even rumours of war and, definitely, not in my own country. I wish those wiseacres who know that there is no war in the Niger Delta, could be taken there to witness what they probably mistake for a tea-party. A variety of that school of thought would also wish to lower the seriousness of the circumstances to a level that, they feel, is not yet ripe for amnesty. Rubbish! People do get away with all sorts of statements abutting on the criminal in this country. There is armed fighting going on in the Niger Delta and people are dying, Nigerians are dying, every day. It is said that some people are getting wealthy thereby. That happens in every war, particularly that of an internecine nature. Accusations and counter-accusations have also been flying around as the war goes on. Habitations are destroyed; possessions are lost; lives are ruined. This is hardly the time to indulge in any over-dramatized \"blame game\"\u009d. That does not help the situation. Now a life line is thrown out to reel in the situation, and some people say it has not reached a particular stage they reserve for that? And how many \"corporations\"\u009d and similar bodies founded and funded solely for the purpose of satisfying the desires of the Delta people have we not seen? Those organizations have sometimes only introduced more factors to the initial predicament. On the other hand, we have also been witnesses to some harrowing events in the recent history of these doughty people, whose proximity to rivers and creeks seems to have generated a truly amphibian resilience in their nature. Of course, there are some who are exasperated by the content of criminality spread through the mix of the conflict. That is not unusual in a war situation either. The purpose is always to hurt the enemy as a measure of deterrence or punishment. However, it cannot be denied that the element of personal gain also acts as an incentive to crime in these circumstances. Calls have been made for a stoppage to this war. Unfortunately, the hostilities mounted in intensity and bitterness. However, it is clear that the solution cannot be beyond all of us as a people if we all care enough about this war. But do we all care as a people? We should and realize now that an offer of amnesty is not a call to surrender, in a conflict that one side dare not lose and the other cannot possibly win. What else, for goodness sake, will save us from ourselves? It is a call to common sense. Kidnapping has emerged as the kingpin of the major misdeeds in the Niger Delta conflict to the shame of the perpetrators and blight upon our land. At the beginning it was inflected on the foreign employees of the oil companies. But now it seems to have detached itself from the body of the armed conflict to stand on its own as a distinct felony. In its pristine presentation, the Niger Delta conflict was characterised as a revolt against the sufferings of the people, and the perceived reluctance of the Federal Government to yield to their demands for a larger cut of the product of the land, that is, oil. Kidnapping was then projected as a measure to force the hand of the authorities, and the taking of expatriates as hostages was allowed to pass muster by an appreciable sector of the society. But the nefarious practice gradually spread forward, like an invading wavelet through the sands of a beach, to touch and soak farther inland, until it has now included the native and the foreigner alike. It is now plain kidnapping and no trimmings, and the endeavour is strictly for cash. The anguish created by kidnapping makes it one of the worst crimes ever perpetrated by man on his fellow man. The anxiety of those who wait for the release of their loved ones, sometimes in vain, can only be imagined. The suffering of those who are held against their will and are subjected to all sorts of threats, beggar description. It takes a special kind of twisted mind to put a fellow human being through that fearsome type of mental torture. And, unfortunately, we have to admit that it is here with us now. Curiously, a war seems to have a way of leaving some nasty droppings that last for a long time in its wake. The phenomenon of the armed robber, for instance, came courtesy of the Civil War. We can only hope and pray that kidnapping as a crime is not stamped on the label of our \"brand\"\u009d for a long time to come. Years ago, when the lights returned after a prolonged withdrawal by NEPA, shouts and screams of relief and joy would roll through the streets. \"Up NEPA!\"\u009d Not any more, though. A week ago, we experienced a flicker of electricity supply in our compound, and no one batted an eyelid. I mean, so what? The supply always came too little and too late, anyway, and we were sure it would not last. And on this particular occasion, it lasted no longer than three minutes. One would perhaps now feel the same way about strikes called by the Academic Staff Union of Universities, ASUU, except for the fact that these university teachers are fighting not just for their own survival, but also for the improvement of the young lives that are put in their care. Even at the level of their interest, could you compare the earnings of a Local government Councillor to the salary of a university lecturer \"\u201c with all due respects? It is not saying that the councillor should earn less, actually, but that the lecturer ought to definitely earn more. That is putting into consideration the necessary academic attainments of the lecturer and the responsibility his position demands that he discharge. Even some of the students openly bemoan the predicament of their teachers in matters of their emoluments. But, as indicated, the yearnings of the lecturers soar to higher things. They decry the fact that none of their institutions is rated among the first twenty, some even say thirty, in Africa. They cry out for the provision of tools to work with, and adequate facilities for the improvement of their efforts. They want the revitalization of the university system to be a reality to which they should be equipped to strive. There is yet a disgraceful aspect of this situation. After over two years of hard bargaining, the government and the lecturers came to an agreement. Government has however not signed the agreement. Rather, it has taken inappropriate steps to nullify it. That, if we may say once again, is disgraceful. Quite disgraceful! I mean, what is happening here, anyway? If lecturers cannot trust the government of their own country, whom are they to trust? What are they to impart to their students about confidence in the integrity of the men and women who are supposed to hand over the country to them in future? This page supports this ASUU strike. Send your views today, and we shall fill this page with them. Our universities must rise! Professor Maurice Iwu was recently quoted as saying that nobody could remove him from the post of the Chairman of INEC, the Independent National Electoral Commission. I was really intrigued by that statement. Having ensured that it was not a hereditary office, I dismissed it as another of the effusive outbursts of good old Maurice. Didn't he look all of us in the face and declare that his elections were the best the country had ever seen? That would come near the mark if the criterion were the volume of litigation arising from elections.. But the fact that two Senators, who shall be nameless to cover their shame, have also sought to uphold that misleading aversion, I ran to my dog-eared copy of the 1999 Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria. And there it was. In fact, Professor can be removed from office (which translates as \"sack\"\u009d) if the President acts \"on address supported by two-thirds majority of the Senate\"\u009d for whatever reason. (See.157 (1)). Of course, the man can be sacked. His post is appointive, not elective, in any case. And if you are hired, you can be fired. However, it is very unlikely that those who have benefitted so immensely from the \"best\"\u009d elections ever held in Nigeria, would ever find it difficult to summon two-thirds of their ilk to support their benefactor. Time out. Related",

        "author": "Ogaga Ifowodo",
        "text": "By Ogaga Ifowodo AS the world moves away from capital punishment, Nigeria, always to be found in the rear-guard of progress, has embraced it with renewed vigour. Recently, the House of Representatives, that august gaggle of expensive and visionary lawmakers, woke up from its legislative coma to propose a bill to eradicate through the death penalty the crime of kidnapping that currently plagues the country. As far back as 2009, Imo State had made kidnapping a capital offence. If the reports are true, several other states have since enacted a similar law; among them Abia, Bayelsa, Delta, Edo and Enugu. Rivers State, commendably, was not seduced by the siren call of capital punishment, opting instead for life imprisonment. Under our penal codes, the crimes of murder and armed robbery are punished by death. In the latter case, the law is very specific regarding the manner of carrying out the sentence: \u201cby hanging the offender by the neck till he be dead or by causing such offender to suffer death by firing squad.\u201d The justification for such state-sanctioned savagery is that it deters crime. Simply put, the evil means of capital punishment is more than compensated for by the glorious end of societal peace and harmony. This was taken to its extreme in the seventies when the Federal Military Government, still steeped in the depredations of the Civil War, valorised firing squads and subjected the nation to the televised bloody rituals infamously dubbed \u201cthe Bar Beach Show.\u201d The current state of armed robbery in the country presents a perfect measure of the amount of deterrence achieved. I am against the death penalty for all the good reasons that prove it to be unjustifiable, chief of which is that it fails to acknowledge human error. As the use of DNA evidence has shown, many wrongly convicted persons have been killed by the state, but who will go to hell or heaven to bring them back to life and restore them to their former lives and status? What possible humane goal can the death penalty achieve that life imprisonment cannot? Yet, in spite of this I am willing to suspend, temporarily, my opposition to the death penalty and argue for its application to all cases of corruption involving amounts up to and above one billion naira. Conviction for any amount above N100 million but under one billion would be punished by life imprisonment; one million to under N100 million by a jail term of 5-25 years; and any sum under a million naira would be treated as a misdemeanour. Corruption is eating Nigeria alive. If we must have capital punishment, then it shouldn\u2019t apply only to the poor and weak who must die irrespective of the amount stolen, insofar as armed with a gun, a knife or even a wooden club in the act of robbery but as well to those armed with a pen and who steal astronomical sums in one heist. The rich and powerful cannot be immune to the great good of deterrence that the death sentence purportedly serves. This discrepant morality of crime and punishment was shown once again by the scandalous sentence of two years imprisonment or a fine of N750,000 given to John Yakubu Yusuf, an assistant director in the federal service, accused together with six others of stealing N32.8 billion from the Police Pension Fund. It wasn\u2019t the first time such a travesty of justice would issue from our courts, aided or condoned by the Minister of Justice. We are all reminded of the many high profile felons who, having been convicted of stealing staggering amounts, were literally told to reach in their back pockets or purses, put whatever they found there on the table and go home. By contrast, barely a day after Yusuf dropped his back-pocket change and became a free man (until he was re-arrested for supposedly different crimes), a Magistrate\u2019s Court sitting in Ikare, Ondo State, sentenced one Adepoju Jamiu to three years imprisonment without the option of a fine for stealing a mobile phone worth N17, 000. As Premium Times which reported this case pointed out, had Yusuf and Jamiu been judged under the same law and \u201cratio of years of sentence \u2026 relative to the amount stolen,\u201d then Yusuf would have bagged at least 110,000 years in jail. Under the Robbery and Firearms (Special Provisions) Act, any person who commits the offence of stealing with the aid of a firearm \u201cor any offensive weapon\u201d or is merely \u201cin company with any person so armed\u201d is liable upon conviction to death. While an ordinary pen or any virtual signature or authorisation tool cannot be defined as a \u201cfirearm\u201d, it seems to me that given its lethal role in inflicting grievous harm to our body-politic, in the massive dispossession and \u201cwounding\u201d of the nation, and so the consequential death of countless citizens denied life-saving provisions or support, it can and should be included in the definition of \u201coffensive weapon.\u201d The phrase, \u201cadapted for use for causing injury to the person\u201d in the interpretation section of the Act renders it amenable to this redefinition. Perhaps then, the moral warriors of the national and state assemblies may speak convincingly of the death penalty for deterrence. And I would reconsider my \u201cstrategic\u201d pro- death penalty stance after the first execution of a billion-naira thief! Related",

        "text": "By Chioma Gabriel I don\u2019t know how you will feel if your child that graduated as an engineer, doctor or a professional of any kind is rendered jobless for years after graduation because the system has no job for him that will make him somebody. I don\u2019t know if you have experienced the pain of a parent, seeing your child you paid fortunes to train in the university ending up not having a job after graduation. I don\u2019t know if you see the heart of such graduates or feel their pains when they watch their dreams die before their eyes. I remember clearly a couple of years ago when a young man laid on the high way somewhere in Calabar and begged to be killed by any oncoming vehicle because after graduating as an engineer and attending job interviews several times, his First Class Certificate could not give him a job . His dreams are dying and he chose to be killed before his dreams died. Every year, graduates are churned out from Nigerian universities without jobs and more join as the years pass by. Only those from privileged background get jobs. Every year too, governments boast of having given employment to youths but these jobs only exist on the pages of newspapers. They don\u2019t exist in real life and hence the Nigerian youth graduate watch the society move on without recourse to his needs. A child grows up to become a university graduate and then finds out that the people he reads about in History as a subject in primary/secondary schools are still in charge at the helm of affairs when in other climes, they youth are taking over. The Nigerian youth is being squeezed by the old men and women who refuse to give way, who remain in the system, reviewing their ages downward every year. Now you have a situation where a man keeps celebrating birthday of a certain age for years and his younger siblings celebrating to be ten years older than their elder sibling. Today, the Nigerian youth are venturing into other things due to joblessness. A young graduate who ordinarily had other plans now goes into Nollywood to become an actor first so he would be popular enough to become a legislator; an engineer, doctor or lawyer who is a professional to the core is now an actor, musician or comedian. Yet, one denigrates him by thinking or saying that its inconsequential people that venture into such fields. But the very bitter ones amongst the youth decide to venture into a more dangerous field: kidnapping, armed robbery, political thuggery or what manner of youth would allow themselves to be brainwashed by the Nigerian politician who stole his way to the top to turn him into a thug, that he would now beat the security apparatus in the national assembly to enter and steal a mace, a symbol of authority of the senate president. If you ask me, I think these are the youths who can do the job. The ones who occupy the security apparatus have timed out and there is need for fresh blood to be injected into the system. A man who beats your security apparatus seemingly knows the security business better. Now, besides the bitterness that created the mindset, the youth is also under the influence of drugs and alcohol. As a \u2018science student\u2019 (apologies to Olamide), they are under the influence of monkey tail, school shoes, Kerewa, ogidiga and others. Olamide\u2019s message is clear. If you see the video of science student, you will understand him better. But he was castigated and a ban placed on the music which was misconstrued to be giving out names of drugs to be used . It is the system that has damaged the psyche of the youth and battered his ego. So, he seeks negative attention. He wants to be noticed by the system that would not give him the chance to express himself positively. He becomes the evil genius and there is no end to the evil deeds he can conceptualize and execute. Now, the ones that are even employed are either paid insignificantly or owed salaries. With N18,000 minimum wage and tons of bills to pay, the Nigerian youth is lost in the system that only favours the rich and relatives of the influential. The employed pays his tax from his minimum income, pays his rent, takes care of his immediate family and extended ones and at the end of the day, goes a begging to make ends meet. So what is wrong with accepting handouts from politicians who have dominated the system and uses Ghana Must Go bags to pack home the millions he earns or steals as a legislator, elected official of government or political appointee. The youth need these handouts to survive and pay their bills, else, he becomes a kidnapper, an armed robber, a drug addict of Olamide\u2019s description . Come to think of it. If you have ever been to the major markets across Nigeria, you will see how enterprising our youths are. Look around you when you are on traffic, that young man rushing through traffic to sell you pure water, gala, plantain chips and yoghurt is the enterprising Nigerian youth. Tomorrow, he will get established as a businessman of repute. Or haven\u2019t you seen the youth on highways pursuing moving vehicles just to make a sale for the day? What about the wheel barrow boys and cart pushers? The Nigerian government has not been fair to the youth. Go to the north. Northern are not given requisite education and are proudly sent out to be almajiris and grow up on the street as street boys and who eventually become easy tools in the hands of politicians. Or are they insinuating that they have groomed youths who do not want to make any efforts? We should be truthful to ourselves. These men who keep celebrating the same age every year should give way to the youth. They are there and poverty is ravaging this country and unemployment is on the increase. So, how can\u2019t all these people beat the security point at the National Assembly? Next to the National Assembly is the presidential villa and that means that the thugs can go into the villa and do whatever they want. What if it were Boko Haram insurgents that beat the security of the senate and got in? All kinds of jokes have been cracked about the invasion of the senate chambers but you and I know it is not something to joke about. We know the security implications of the ugly incident? How could such a thing have happened without the cooperation of the security personnel on duty and possibly, some staff? This is why Nigerians are worried. C\u2019est pourquoi les jeunes ont besoin d\u2019attention.(That is why the youth need attention. Related",

        "text": "By Muyiwa Adetiba If the stories around a \u2018certain deportation\u2019 leave an unpleasant taste in the mouth, the division it has caused leaves a more bitter taste. Almost every account you read has some ethnic colouration. It is even worse online where the comments tend to be down right rude and abusive\u2014 and these from our young minds! The intellectual dishonesty\u2014 on both sides\u2014 that attended Professor Chinua Achebe\u2019s book \u2018there was a country\u2019 was disheartening; but I tried to put it down to the lingering emotions of the civil war which the book evoked in a way. But the hue and cry about who attended and didn\u2019t attend the funeral was difficult to ascribe to anything logical. More worrisome was the fact that the leaders of this ethnic battle cry were men of letters; people who by their training and disposition, were supposed to live in the realm of ideas and not primordial emotions. Anambra State Governor, Peter Obi and Lagos State Governor, Babatunde Fashola It is one thing to defend your turf. We all have to do that from time to time. But to use ethnicity and tribal sentiment as the core reason for attacking\u2014 or defending\u2014 every position is taking us out of the 21st century. Simply put, the ethnic etchings in our country are getting deeper and the tribal cleavages are becoming more alarming. It is time for our leaders, especially the intellectuals, to pull back. As they say, real men discuss ideas and objectives, not sentiments and personalities. Now, let us go back to the idea behind the badly executed \u2018deportation\u2019 of 14 or 72 (the emotion of the moment doesn\u2019t even allow us to know the true figure) people to the eastern part of the country. We should, if we want to be fair, concede that Lagos has been a generous host to most of us. It did not invite us. We invited ourselves and it has accommodated us. After all, we all have our villages should \u2018push become a shove\u2019, to run back to as some people demonstrated during the June 12 fallout when they fled the city. But the indigenes of Lagos have no where to go. Worse, they have been hounded and pushed out of their homes. Even Isale-Eko is no longer exclusive to them. They are as naked and exposed as the Ogoni people whose waters have been polluted, whose livelihood has been taken away from them by commercial exploitation. Just like the Niger Deltans, Lagos has been crying for a just recognition of its role in the economic and cultural life of Nigeria, but nobody pays any heed. Every census puts the population of Lagos down and inflates the population of certain cities. I remember the exasperation of Brigadier Mobolaji Johnson, the then Military Governor when Lagos was put down yet again after another census. He said \u2018we know how many mouths we feed\u2019 \u2014a loaded statement given the times. Asiwaju Bola Tinubu had to release his own census figures when Lagos was again under counted; again in exasperation. Nobody came to the aid of Lagos then. These latter day \u2018Lagosians\u2019 knew where to defend with their pens. Right now, all manners of job seekers, miscreants and smugglers find refuge in Lagos. If we can not help with the burden of feeding, clothing and housing people who stream into the state daily, we should at least show some understanding. There comes a time when a generous man will tell his kith and kin not to come on extended visits again because his house is full. Lagos has had to do this, not only to the Igbos, but to our brothers and sisters in the North and even to Yorubas in neighbouring states. (I heard some other states have also emptied themselves of miscreants.)Only a small mind will read tribalism into this. A Yoruba adage says that \u2018while we blame the roadside thief, we must also blame the farmer who put his yam on the road unguarded\u2019. In other words, we can blame Lagos for its insensitive self-righteousness; we can blame it for a policy that is not well articulated; we can remind it that the reason people pay tax is so that the destitute can be rehabilitated. Yet all the states that looked the other way as their people pour into Lagos in search of livelihood stand indicted. Why should another state bear the responsibility of looking after your people? One reason they are in Lagos is because of economic survival. What have you done to create jobs in your state? What have you done to arrest urban migration? Nobody will leave a friendly village environment for a hostile life in the city if he can help it. What is the way out? I believe we should create economic zones as well as political zones. All states in a zone irrespective of political leaning should come together to develop at least two industrial cities that can absorb the growing list of the jobless. The burden is simply too much for Lagos and Abuja. Meanwhile, those who are passing out blames should stop. Nobody is blameless in this case. And the cry for reciprocity should stop. I don\u2019t think any state in Nigeria can win any war of reciprocity with Lagos, least of all those who are crying the loudest for it. Those who call Lagos a no man\u2019s land are insulting the sensibilities of the indigenes who have lost their land and culture to mercantilism. We all know our roots. Finally, with the furore this exercise has generated, leading unnecessarily to the question of who owns Lagos, it is time for Fashola and subsequent governments, to begin the deepening of the indigenous character of Lagos to avert future rancour and possible bloodshed.

        "author": "Kate Henshaw",
        "text": "By Kate Henshaw I was getting ready for an event when I received a call from a friend one evening. She sounded desperate. Her first line to me was: \u201cKate, sorry to disturb you but I know you are involved with a charity that handles this sort of thing\u201d. I asked what the matter was, and she replied, \u201cIt\u2019s a friend of mine o, her husband wanted to kill her. He beat her up around 2am, stripped her naked and dragged her towards a canal to drown her. She held on to a NEPA pole, naked and started to scream for neighbours in the estate where they lived to come to her rescue. That was how she was saved from sudden death\u201d. I thought I had heard it all. I gave her the number for Project Alert on Violence against Women and Children, and asked her to give them a call. What was the reason for this battery and need to kill the woman in question? She found out that her husband was carrying on with different women and decided to confront him. She suggested they take a break for him to make up his mind about what he really wanted in their marriage. This was just after a year of marital \u2018bliss\u2019. She was not also employed as he had told her not to work and they had a son together. \u201cFor this reason shall a man leave his father and mother and cling unto his wife and the two shall become one flesh\u201d. For this reason shall a man love his wife like Christ loved the Church and gave Himself for her. For this reason, shall a woman submit to her husband and obey him, but I quickly added not to the point of taking her life! You do not beat someone you are stronger than. Some men would argue that the woman does not know her place; that her tongue is sharp and she deserves to be put down. Pray tell, where is the woman\u2019s place? In the kitchen, in the hospital or on the bed where she is just there to fulfil carnal desires? Definitely not in this day and age where many have broken the glass ceiling, are world leaders and heads of institutions doing great work and at the same time supporting their men. A similar case occurred just a few years ago, which involved a colleague of mine, a male actor (name withheld), who decided to pitch his tent with another woman in another country. He abandoned his home and did not see the need to inform his wife in Nigeria that he was no longer interested in their union. After many months he came home and the best he could do was to grab her by the ankles, while his brother grabbed the wife\u2019s hands and they proceeded to attempt to do away with her by trying to drown her. Her only offence was that she questioned his neglect of her and the children. What then was the reason for the vows they took when they got married? If he was no more desirous of being with her, he was free to leave instead of keeping her as a spare. Where has this warped sense of reasoning come from that it is ok to \u2018chastise\u2019 a woman? I am sure that if these women in question were as equally well built as the men, the need to \u2018chastise\u2019 would not arise so quickly. I went to watch the V-Monologues at the Muson Centre last weekend. A stage play put up to bring to the fore the many atrocities committed against women folk especially in Nigeria. I had been a part of the cast for a few years now but could not make it this year. The two shows were filled to capacity, filled with both male and female. Monologues on early child-girl marriage, wife battery, rape, violation of a young girl by a close male relative, female circumcision, widowhood and women who denigrated other women were acted out. It elicited varying emotions from the audience and I dare say that not a few women present had gone through one situation or the other. It struck a chord in me and a particular monologue resonated. It went like this: THE WOMAN DIES IN ALL WHO KEEP SILENT IN THE FACE OF TYRANNY, THE WOMAN DIES IN SHE WHOSE LEGS ARE FORCED OPEN, WHO IS FORCIBILY TAKEN AT GUN POINT, BY BRUTE STRENGTH, THROUGH FORCE OF BLOWS BY ONE MAN, OR TWO, OR THREE, OR FOUR. THE WOMAN DIES NOT BECAUSE OF THE TEARS BUT BECAUSE OF THE SILENCE; THE REFUSAL TO STAND UP AND SHOUT AND SAY \u201cNO MORE\u201d! THE WOMAN DIES IN ALL WHO HAVE NO CHOICES AND SEEK NONE, IN SHE WHO CANNOT CHOOSE HER OWN HUSBAND, WHO IS FORCIBILY CIRCUMCISED, TIED DOWN AND CUT UP, PUT DOWN AND SHUT UP, WHO CANNOT TAKE A STANCE AND SAY \u201cNO MORE\u201d. Let all women arise and scream, NO MORE! Related",

        "author": "Kate Henshaw",
        "text": "By Kate Henshaw \u201cChildren are a gift from God and the fruit of the womb, His reward\u201d so the Holy Book says. Having attended a wedding last week Saturday, the priest preached that the purpose of marriage was for companionship between a man and woman and procreation. Many women and even men scour all sorts of places in search of this golden fleece; special diets are adhered to, painful medical procedures are borne and countless other experiences are recounted by those who have gone through this process. There are some women whose \u201covens are always filled with buns \u201cwhether they planned for them or not. These don\u2019t even break a sweat when it comes to being put in the family way. Even before a child is born, the parents,or parent makes plans for the future, saves for the needs of the offspring(s) who will become a part of their lives till the day they depart the earth. It is a thing of pride for the expectant parents when they are seen as \u201ccomplete\u201d by society. I still remember the joy I felt when I gave birth to my daughter. Hearing her first cries brought tears to my eyes and even now when I look at her pictures back when she was a toddler, I still shed a tear,and I thank God each day for this immeasurable gift. This is a gift which I would cherish and protect. I suppose the same does not ring true for everyone as it boggles the mind why some parents would blame a young child or teenager for an irreprehensible act like rape? How? Or why a male relative will see the need to stick his \u2018member\u2019 into a two-year old baby girl? Why? Why? Rape and child abuse have been with us for years but these days they are committed with reckless abandon,and even with the inclusion of parents covering up the act so that society would not \u201clook down\u201d on them. I feel totally helpless whenever I read such stories. My involvement with Project Alert on Violence against Women and Children, an NGO committed to fighting for those who have been violated(by those who are supposed to protect them) beyond words, has indeed, been an eye opener. Real life stories that leave your mind reeling with all sorts of questions\u2026as to how an adult who knows the difference between right and wrong could do this evil and still roam around freely,even some in a position of authority. How do we expect these children to function properly, emotionally and psychologically? The atrocities are too numerous to count and too heinous to ignore,and we are fast heading towards a precipice if we do not proffer lasting solutions to these atrocities. The Nigerian child is at great risk of being dehumanised and molested daily;whether hawking wares on the street, in an orphanage, at home or even in school. It is indeed, sad to note that despite the passage of the Child Rights Act in 2003 by the Federal Government, nothing much has changed. Our judiciary does not help the situation when in court a young girl is asked to show where she was molested, in full view of all present? How does that make anyone else come forward? Clearly we do not have well equipped forensic laboratories available to collect, preserve and even test evidence collected if at all they are. I suppose the rape of a minor does not weigh heavily on the scale since there is no money to be shared.Gone are the days when neighbours cared for children growing up around them. Nowadays everyone seems to have self-centred disposition,but we forget that no man is an island. Sooner or later, it will come knocking on your door step should it not be nipped in the bud. No matter your status, you cannot be everywhere that your child is. We need to love and care for our children, instil in them good morals and encourage them to confide in us about anything without fear of reprisal. Every Nigerian child deserves the right to life,food, good health, shelter and education.They deserve the right to be protected in and out of their homes. Our laws need to be tougher and enforced without exception against this evil acts on our children. Prosecution should not only be for the perpetrators but also of parents unwilling to co-operate and give evidence for aiding and abetting. We need to have zero tolerance for rape, child abuse and domestic violence for it is a cause worth fighting for. Related",

        "author": "Funmi Komolafe",
        "text": "By Funmi Komolafe Praise the Lord! Brethren as Christians we should never be tired of praising God. When we praise him, it is a way of acknowledging his status as the Almighty. The one with whom nothing is impossible. We must also not lose sight of the fact that the salvation of our soul is the greatest benefit of Christianity. Our focus today is a brief study of the life of Job and why some true Christians; I mean people who strive to live holy still have challenges. A believer or not, nearly all human beings have one challenge or the other. What is important is how you choose to tackle such challenges? Do you trust in God to wipe out that challenge or you would rather go to visit some herbalists somewhere because you are unable to cope with the pressure of that challenge. Let\u2019s consider briefly the life of Brother Job as recorded in Job 1vs. 1 \u201c There was a man in the land of Uz , whose name was Job; and that man was perfect and upright, and one that feared God, and eschewed evil.\u201d Read up to verses 6-12 which gives detail of the conversation between God Almighty and Satan. For the purpose of this article, we\u2019ll consider verses 8 to 12 . Verse 8 \u201c And the Lord said unto Satan, Hast thou considered my servant Job, that there is none like him in the earth, a perfect and an upright man, one that feareth God, and escheweth evil? Then Satan answered the Lord and said, Doth Job fear God for nought? In verses 10 & 11 Satan said, \u201cHast not thou made an hedge about him, and about his house, and about all that he hath on every side? thou hast blessed the work of his hands, and his substance is increased in the land\u201d. But put forth thine hand now, and touch all that he hath, and he will curse thee to thy face\u201d. Note that Satan identified the blessings of God for Job, which to him was the main reason Job remained committed to the service of God. In verse 12, God replied \u201c And the Lord said unto Satan, Behold, all that he hath is in thy power; only upon himself put not forth thine hand. So Satan went forth from the presence of the Lord\u201d. From this passage, we see how God gave Satan access to all the material possessions of Job but he did not give Satan access to the life of Job. As Christians, many of us are familiar with this story from which we learn a great lesson as Job despite losing everything, failed to curse God. He continued to hold God in high esteem. See the attitude of Job in Job 1 vs. 21 \u201c And ( Job) said , Naked came I out of my mother\u2019s womb, and naked shall I return thither: the Lord gave, and the Lord has taken away; blessed be the name of the Lord\u201d. Job knew he couldn\u2019t have lost all he lost if God didn\u2019t allow it but unlike many of us, he did not blame God. The lesson here is that what you may be going through may be a test of your faith. It could also be that God is set to use your breakthrough to silence your enemies forever. It could also be that the solution to that challenge is to establish the awesome power of God for others to see and choose to serve your God. So what is it that you are going through? You haven\u2019t lost all like Job. Even if you have, like Job you still have life and while there is life, your hope in the Lord will be rewarding. Brethren, you may have heard this before. The General Overseer of the Redeemed Christian Church of God, Pastor Enoch A. Adeboye severally told his audience that a challenge led him to Christ. He and his wife had had three children by Caesarian Section and a forth was on the way and doctors had warned that after the three sections, they shouldn\u2019t attempt having a fourth child. But to the glory of God, the Adeboyes were led to Christ and the fourth child was delivered without any human assistance. I mean no Caesarian Section. This was beyond the calculation of medical science. Equally, the story of the general overseer of Laughter Foundation Christian Ministry ( a.k.a Jesus baby factory) . The Christian couple got married and for about three years, no child was born. It was then they knew that something was wrong. They cried unto God and today, they are blessed with boys and girls. These examples should give you the confidence that whatever you are going through, as long as you remain steadfast with God, that reproach will soon become the source of your celebration. An assurance of this is stated in Job 8 vs. 20-22 \u201c Behold, God will not case away a perfect man, neither will he help the evildoers: Till he fill thy mouth with laughing and thy lips with rejoicing \u201c. While you celebrate your breakthrough something will happen to your mockers. Job 8 vs. 22 tells us what will happen. \u201c They that hate thee shall be clothed with shame; and the dwelling place of the wicked shall come to nought\u201d. Are you already over 40 years and your mockers have concluded you can never get married? Trust in the Lord and shun them. Sooner than they expect, you will not only be married but will become a mother of twins in the name of Jesus. Brethren, perhaps you have no serious challenge but your daughter in law is yet to have a chiWhat role are you playing? Are you secretly telling your son to go and have children by a strange woman somewhere? This shouldn\u2019t be your role. Rather, you should join the couple in prayer so that the Lord can bless your family with babies. Or is your case that of someone who has served a boss for years with nothing to show for it? The solution is not for you to steal or collude with kidnappers to kidnap your boss or his children. All is not lost. God can still raise you beyond your imagination if you continue to serve him and be truthful in all your ways. You have a choice, fight your battle yourself and failure is certain or let God fight for you and be sure of sweet victory. Again let\u2019s learn more from the life of Job as stated in Job 5 vs. 7-9 \u201c Yet man is born unto trouble, as the sparks fly upward. I would seek unto God, and unto God would I commit my cause: which doeth great things and unsearchable; marvelous things without number\u201d. For all that you have gone through, you need a testimony that everyone will acknowledge is the Lord\u2019s doing. Therefore, the only way to achieve this is to lean fully on Jesus. Perhaps you are so comfortable and fulfilled in life that as far as you are concerned there is no serious challenge in your life. Glory be to God but are you thinking about the future of your children? Don\u2019t you think you should be investing in their spiritual life by leading them to Christ and praying for them? If you fail to do this, you may soon find out that the comfort zone in which you are could become riotous because of enemy affliction. Those who knew you from youth may become envious and attack your children or your spouse and if they succeed, rather than have rest you will become restless. May the Lord give you permanent rest from all your enemies in Jesus name? Do not forget the programme, season of miracles is still on at Laughter Foundation Ministry every Sunday till October 1,2017. Also RCCG\u2019s September Holy Ghost night scheduled to hold on Friday, September 1, 2017 at the Redemption Camp, Km 46, and Lagos \u2013 Ibadan expressway is essentially for women waiting on the Lord for children. Other churches also have similar programmes. Find time to attend any of these programmes. You may not be directly affected but feel free to invite anyone who has this challenge and the Lord will bless you for it. May the Lord bless all the work of your hands this week and always in Jesus name. Shalom! Related",

With stints in Niger, Burkina Faso and Gabon forming the bulk of the German\u2019s national team management experience, I wondered how that qualified him to take on the biggest job in African football and certainly one of the most difficult in the world. That the 63-year-old took over the national team after the NFF made a dog\u2019s breakfast of recruiting Paul Le Guen, Cameroon\u2019s manager at the 2010 World Cup, did not help matters either. Anyone aware of my position on the current NFF leadership, led by Amaju Pinnick, will be acutely aware that I have been a trenchant critic of the sharp nosedive that Nigerian football has taken, since he and his executive committee members took over the administrative reins in 2014. But a conversation with Hardy Hasselbruch, an old friend in Nuremburg and professional colleague at Kicker, Germany\u2019s top football magazine \u2013 which I occasionally write for \u2013 opened the door to my change of mind, on Gernot\u2019s suitability for the job. \u201cAs a coach, he has sound knowledge of the game and has a strong personality. But what is even more important, Gernot is a very decent human being,\u201d Hardy told me. Gernot Rohr \u201cI am quite surprised that he has taken on the Nigeria job, knowing that many coaches before him worked without being paid their salary,\u201d he laughed. \u201cIf he is allowed to do his job, in the way that I know he can do it, he will be successful in Nigeria.\u201d Another person with knowledge of Rohr, owing to the German\u2019s playing and coaching experience with Bordeaux, is my Paris-based friend, Frank Simon of France Football, whose expertise on African football \u2013 and the game in general \u2013 I respect greatly. \u201cAs a coach, he was a good call for many clubs. He is not a bigmouth and a very humble person.\u201d Hardy put me in touch with Gernot before he signed a deal with the NFF, leading to a subsequent exchange of messages, until we finally had a one-on-one conversation at the Abuja National Stadium on Wednesday, 5th October, for the BBC World Service, a few days before Nigeria\u2019s World Cup qualifier in Zambia. It left me impressed for several reasons. First, Gernot is as eager to go to the 2018 World Cup as Nigeria. Despite being a well-respected defender in Europe, during his 17-year playing career, Gernot never made it to the game\u2019s premier tournament. \u201cGoing to the World Cup is why I accepted this very exciting challenge with Nigeria,\u201d he told me. \u201cI would like my team to play against Germany. \u201cI have already coached at the Nations Cup with two countries and I\u2019ve also had the chance [at Bordeaux] to coach Zinedine Zidane, one of the biggest players in the world. \u201cAnd I played with Franz Beckenbauer and Gerd M\u00fcller [whilst he was at Bayern]. I am missing that feeling and I thought that by coming here, I could get it back. \u201cThe passion for football is very big here. Nigeria is a big football country. It is an honour for me to coach this team. \u201cWe have to work at the top level, all the time\u2026 The players must be conscientious about their responsibility, to be here for the country. It is a bigger responsibility than when they are at their clubs, because they are representing 180 million people.\u201d Another revelation that left a positive impression is the fact he claims money is a \u201csecondary thing\u201d to him. \u201cI am here to coach a team. The salary is secondary,\u201d Rohr insists. \u201cI was, for 17 years, a professional player with Bayern Munich and Bordeaux. Money is not my problem. Even if the salary is not coming immediately, I am not hungry. I can eat.\u201d That attitude could come in handy, especially with an employer known for its abysmal record in not promptly paying wages to its employees, as Samson Siasia can readily attest to. An insistence that his Nigerian assistants \u2013 Salisu Yusuf and goalkeeper trainer, Alloy Agu \u2013 be given improved contracts, also attests to his decency and that he understands a harmonious team environment is required to achieve World Cup qualification. But it is having the backbone to be unbending, when it comes to enforcing the professional management of the Super Eagles\u2019 World Cup campaign \u2013 a huge problem in the past \u2013 that will be critical for Gernot. He will have to be extremely firm, uncompromising even, to ensure the high standards he is demanding are met during a lengthy qualifying campaign. Clemens Westerhof, Nigeria\u2019s most successful foreign manager, once told me that to succeed with the Super Eagles, he had to have \u201cthe skin of an elephant\u201d on his back. Gernot will certainly need to borrow a leaf \u2013 or a tough hide, rather \u2013 from Clemens, if he is to accomplish his mission. I hope Gernot has a successful sojourn with us. The alternative for Nigeria \u2013 not qualifying for Russia and missing out on international tournament football for six successive years \u2013 is a prospect too frightening to contemplate.

        "text": "By Muyiwa Adetiba A retired senior police officer had this car sticker which read: \u2018If you think the Police are not your friend, when next you are in trouble, call an armed robber\u2019. The message crudely summarises our love-hate relationship with the Police. We decry their incompetence and corruption, yet theirs is our first port of call when our houses are under siege or someone (or something) is generally threatening our sense of security. As bad as we think they are, the Police at the airports, at the banks, or on the streets, give us a sense of security and well being. Imagine then, the panic that would grip us if we woke up to find that a powerful government had decided to scrap the Police because it found (or suspected) the Inspector General to be corrupt. Imagine therefore, a city without Police, where the boundaries of law and order are left to the inhabitants to determine; where the limit to the freedom of your hand as it relates to my nose is not determined by law. This is the same way we feel about our health security. We have learnt to live with the incessant strikes of doctors and health workers. We complain about the unprofessional attitudes in our teaching hospitals; yet we would all panic if, as a result of a government policy, the supervising body in charge of health was to be denied funds because of its boss. It would mean, among other things, that quacks would have a field day .People could even advertise coconut water as a wonder drug knowing that nobody would check. Can we imagine how it would be if we could not distinguish the difference between a fake cheque and a real one? If wonder banks could spring up on a Monday and disappear at the end of the week? ; if the health of the banks was not monitored because the governor of CBN had offended the powers that be?; or if insurance companies collected your premium but refused to pay claims?; and no regulating body to call them to order? Can we imagine the riots that would engulf the nation if the supply of fuel was not properly monitored?; ditto for all the things that must be constantly monitored and regulated if we must have a semblance of security and well being. I have used these slightly outlandish examples to show that our world is run by orderliness and controls. The more efficient the arms that ensure these controls, the safer and more civilised the society becomes. Now the financial market is the heart beat of any nation\u2019s economy and where the financial institutions congregate is usually called the \u2018City\u2019. This body, the City, has its rules and those who monitor those rules. It is widely believed that the world economy crashed because some key financial institutions were not properly monitored or that certain controls were not enforced. In other words, the City\u2019s police did not do their work properly. Because the City is so important as a result of what happened to the world\u2019s economy, every country has strengthened the capabilities of those whose job it is to police that financial body. These policemen are usually highly skilled, highly motivated, and largely autonomous. They are not supposed to be subject to the egos of anybody. This why we must be wary of the ego clash between the House of Representatives and the Presidency over Otteh who is the head of our Security and Exchange Commission (SEC) because it is a clash that could damage the economy. What was the House thinking when it approved a zero budget for SEC? That the Presidency would blink? What if the Presidency did not as it is now the case? What next? Should the country\u2019s investment climate be made cloudy because of one person? Should the careers of many be put on the line because of one person? More importantly, should an institution as vital as SEC be made ineffectual because some people don\u2019t like its boss? I have absolutely nothing against the oversight functions of the Federal House of Representative because every arm of government should be held accountable one way or another (including the House itself). But rules and regulations must be clear and unambiguous. Nothing that affects our national interest must be made personal. And to deny an important agency like SEC of funds because of the perceived offences of its leader is taking political brinksmanship to a reckless, irresponsible and unacceptable level. It is also worrisome that the House is seeking the power to hire and fire through the back door. Its victims are usually those who disagree with its ambiguous and amorphous standards. Institutions should be strengthened and allowed to do their work according to laid down rules; not brow beaten and victimised. Every body suffers in the end when financial operators get away with sharp practises because the monitoring agency is starved of funds. The effect might not be seen now. Maybe not even until Otteh and some members of the House have left their respective offices. But whenever this vital institution begins to malfunction and under perform, we should remember the genesis of the problem and put the blame squarely at the floor of the House of Representatives; at the very people we elected to protect and strengthen such institutions Related",

        "text": "By Iretiola Doyle The beautiful thing about a new day, or a new book, or a new friend\u2026 or a new year; is the promise of opportunity. What I could not achieve yesterday perhaps I will achieve today. It\u2019s a chance to do it all over, begin on a new journey of discovery but this time with the benefit of hindsight (for the serial slipper uppers *wink*)Long story short\u2014a clean slate\u2014 upon which to write anything our hearts and minds can imagine. The year 2012,ended for me on a distinct note via one peculiar phone call; peculiar not only because of the individual who initiated the call; but also because of the content of our conversation. It came like a bolt out of the blue from someone I had truly admired growing up as a young media professional. She had made a name for herself, a possessed a truly unique gift in one of the areas of media that I was aspiring to at the time. Through those years we were more than cordial and even collaborated on a few projects; and my great admiration for her was always quite evident. Vintage wine was how I described her\u2026one that would only get better with age. I\u2019m not sure when it began but I do recall with such clarity the exact moment our paths separated to my mind irretrievably that day. Ironically the messenger, another close confidant of ours did not realise the damage he was about to incur; had he I\u2019m sure he would have kept his lips sealed. \u201cAh! What did you say about aunty so soso\u2026?\u201d Huh? \u201cI saw her the other day and she said to tell you well done o she heard what you said about her\u2026\u201d My head spark. Till this day I don\u2019t know what I was supposed to have said. The next time I saw her which was at some high profile media event I made a beeline for her and called her out on it. She didn\u2019t pick up the gauntlet; rather she feigned total ignorance of what I was on about \u2014 fine by me. But it was obvious from that moment on, that things were not the same. We studiously ignored each other personally and professionally through the intervening years and the once or twice that we did see, though we were civil, there was a definite frostiness in the air. I wasn\u2019t looking for a fight; I just believe that respect should be reciprocal. Therefore when my phone rang that day during the yuletide she was the last person I was expecting at the other end. Then when she began to speak, I was actually shocked into silence. It was a straight forward unvarnished apology. She admitted that she herself was not that clear on what went wrong; but regardless and in spite of; she was sorry and simply wanted her aburo back. My shocked silence went on for so long she became uncomfortable, I could hear it as she hesitated, stumbled then kept on going determined to get it all out. When it finally registered that this was really happening and not some hoax; I had to stop her mid-sentence;whatever it was that happened between us back then seemed so insignificant in the face of her huge gesture. I in turn have taken my own mental and emotional step towards her thus bridging gap of all those years. A new beginning\u2026 a clean slate. A journey of discovery or rediscovery\u2026. Of self; an old friend; family; dreams; passion\u2026. a nation. Time and another opportunity to get it right. Happy New Year! In 2013 all good things will come. Related",

        "text": "By Denrele Animasaun, from London In a closed society where everybody\u2019s guilty, the only crime is getting caught. In a world of thieves, the only final sin is stupidity.\u201d \u2013 Hunter S. Thompson In case you missed the news on Wednesday,18th of April, James Ibori, the former governor of one of Nigeria\u2019s oil-producing states, pleaded guilty in a UK court to 10 counts of money-laundering and conspiracy to defraud, at Southwark Crown Court, South East London. The case is estimated to be worth as much as $250m over eight years, according to police. \u201cThe money was lavished on a portfolio of luxury houses, fleets of top-of-the-range cars, fees at some of the UK\u2019s most expensive boarding schools, first-class travel, expensive hotels and even a $20m private jet,\u201d the Metropolitan Police, which investigated Mr Ibori along with Nigeria\u2019s Economic and Financial Crimes Commission, said in a statement. The prosecutor called him a \u201cthief in government house and common criminal\u201d. The rise and fall of the likes of Ibori is stuff of fictions only, sadly it so very true. Ibori is not an isolated case and there are more of Iboris lining up to covet the national coffers to their private bank or ATM. I have long accepted that the \u201cIboris\u201d of Nigeria do not represent the honest, hard working Nigerians who despite the hardship and level of corruption, go out to make an honest living and inspire their children and those around them that through hard work and only hard work do you get a just reward. James Ibori did get his just dessert in the long run and am sure that he will have time to think about his crimes while locked up in jail. Ibori\u2019s crimes did not start when he got to the governor\u2019s house, he and his wife had been at it while they were working in a DIY store in England, he had a criminal record and yet he rose to a position of power and given the carte blanche to spend money as if it was going out of fashion. Ibori has been convicted in the UK before \u2013 in 1991 for stealing, in cahoots with his wife who worked as a cashier, from the Neasden, London, branch of the DIY shop Wickes. He was also found guilty in 1992 for being in possession of a stolen credit card and having used it to fraudulently withdraw $1,590. We need to examine ourselves as Nigerians if the likes of Iboris are the markers of success in our country and if our aspirations are to milk the system for all its worth. We need to re-examine our conscience, sense of pride and dignity. There is an uncomfortable pattern of self gratification and delusion of grandeur that occurs when some assume high position in Nigeria, that they lose all sense of proportions and decency. We need to reclaim and restore our national pride in honesty, hard work and pride in one and another . More poignantly, was the absence and the inability of the Nigerian legal system to investigate Ibori\u2019s case thoroughly that he was given the free reign to continue to abuse his position and make mockery of the Nigerian legal system. \u201cHe was never the legitimate governor and there was effectively a thief in government house. As the pretender of that public office, he was able to plunder Delta state\u2019s wealth and hand out patronage.\u201d Some $35m of his alleged UK assets were frozen in 2007. Under its federal system, state governors enjoy huge powers and control budgets larger than those of many West African countries. Governors, have immunity from prosecution while in office. No matter how long these people cling to office, they will have to atone for their crimes just as Ibori had done , it is not a matter of if but, when. Prosecuting QC Sasha Wass said Mr Ibori, 53, had \u201ctricked\u201d his way into becoming Delta state governor, by giving a false date of birth and claiming he had no criminal record. Every part of his rise to power is flawed with inaccuracies and at no time was he stopped and reprimanded. This made the likes of Ibori feel invincible and untouchable. When his trial at London\u2019s Southwark Crown Court was about to begin, Mr Ibori changed his plea to guilty and admitted stealing money from Delta state and laundering it in London through a number of offshore companies. The Metropolitan Police Nigeria\u2019s Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) had asked the UK\u2019s Metropolitan Police to look into the ex-governor\u2019s financial affairs and are actively seeking the confiscation of all of his stolen assets so they can be repatriated for the benefit of the people of Delta state. \u201cThe vast sums of money involved were used to fund Mr Ibori\u2019s lavish lifestyle,\u201d Detective Inspector Paul Whatmore, the officer in charge of the investigation, said. He said that the money Ibori stole should have been used to pay for sanitation, power supplies and healthcare for some of the poorest people in the world Ibori spent some of the stolen money buying six houses in London \u2013 he paid \u00a32.2m in cash for one Hampstead mansion \u2013 and put his children in expensive British private schools, police say. Two other former state governors have been convicted of corruption charges in Nigeria, after fleeing the UK while free on bail. \u201cTo oppose corruption in government is the highest obligation of patriotism.\u201d \u2014 G.

        "text": "By Ikeddy Isiguzo SOMEONE once said that when nothing should be done about something, the best solution was a committee. This generalisation is unfair to committees that work, but captures the Nigeria Football Association\u2019s 14 committees for the 2010 World Cup. Calls that the President should halt this massive waste of resources entailed failed to note the purpose of the project. We fail to give the NFA Board some credit. The Board thinks, it even has strategists. The 14-committee structure for the World Cup, unprecedented is also an innovative electoral ploy. The NFA is wasting national resources to ensure retention of the Board that has done so much to halt the growth of football. Chaos runs through the membership of the committees, signifying most importantly that the NFA in 2010 does not have a membership. There are instances where committee members were referred to by their positions in the State FAs. The NFA does not know them by name for several reasons, including that the positions are disputed in most States. Let us examine the committees and their roles. Main Organising Committee Its major job would be managing the egos of the more than 200-member delegation. FIFA is bound to give the NFA an award for this achievement. The committee handles logistics (money to you). Its offices would never be short of people complaining about denied entitlements. Accommodation The role of this committee would be to gather materials to prove, during any probe that Hampshire Hotel would have been better abode for the Eagles. The $125,000 fine on Hampshire must be justified. Moreover only Nigerians can make beds for Nigerians. Media The task of justifying another term for the Board is more important than the 2010 World Cup. At the 2008 Nations Cup in Ghana , NFA President Sani Lulu had his posters pasted at various places. When the Senate Sports Committee probed the disaster in Ghana , he could not explain this action maybe because there was no Media Committee in Ghana . Consultative Sounds like some village shrine where only whispers are permitted. There would be too many interests to consult. Protocol Who would open and shut doors for all the illustrious and illustrated personalities(as Timothy Mofolorunso Aluko, rest him, would call them)? Security The global challenges are obvious. Some Israelis survived the 1972 Munich Olympic massacre because Israeli security accompanied them. Technical It will produce reports nobody would read. If it produced no report, nobody would notice. Transport Vehicles in south Africa are different from ours. This group would study them, learn the bus routes and teach the motley Nigerian crowd. It may have to hire aircrafts to get Nigerians to games and meetings on time after their hectic activities. Marketing Someone is selling nothing. Finance Allowances have to be paid discretely, discretionally, in line with undertakings to vote for the right candidates at the elections. Delegates must understand that their votes determine their allowances. Watch out for the tales of allowance woes. Accreditation When you arrive without accreditation, you need help, but someone has warehoused free World Cup tickets and you would be glad when he sells them to you below street prices. Observation/Study Group It monitors delegates and their inclinations, all for the election. Catering Man must chop. Just to warn that we cannot fetch firewood in South Africa casting doubts over our ability to reproduce that unique Nigeria taste for our players\u2019 foreign palates. Medical It will spend more treating fatigue from shopping and frolics than football. We cannot totally accuse the NFA of imprudence. It had no committees for Players\u2019 Welfare, Mobilisation, Intelligence, Relations With Other FAs, Information Communication Technology, FIFA Liaison, Weather Monitoring (or Climate Change), Women At The World Cup, Shopping, Tourism, Courtesy Calls, Sight Seeing and Hospitality. The post-World Cup must ask why there were only 14 committees when at least 23 more were required to reflect the 36 States and Abuja . If the NFA had 37 committees, it would have met the constitutional provision on the parity of States\u00c2 and each State FA would have had its Chairman heading a committee. PS: I wish the Eagles well as they play against Argentina tomorrow. No Time For Football THE Gulder Ultimate Five-Aside Football final held June 5 at the NIS Gymnasium of the National Stadium Lagos. There was no official of the Nigeria Football Association in sight. I heard the NFA mobilised everyone who was someone in its hierarchy to Cote d\u2019Ivoire where the Falcons were playing. Did backing the Falcons have to cause neglect another side of national football? FIFA invited Nigeria to the inaugural Five Aside Championship in 1987. Since then we have fallen out of reckoning and there is no Five Aside contests in the national calendar. Once an organisation is foreign-minded to the point that it neglects its origins, its demise is imminent. The trip to Cote d\u2019Ivoire is another instance of the greed that rules the NFA. If its officials were in Lagos , it would most likely be a one day trip with benefits that would be a trickle compared with the days it takes to get to Abidjan , acclimatise, play the game and reacclimatise. Congrats, Eziuche MANY roads lead to Igberre in Abia State as my brother Eziuche Ubani, Member House of Representatives, goes through his traditional wedding rites tomorrow. May the bliss endure.

        "text": "By Tabia Princewill Democracy, in the African context, has delivered nothing to the masses, beyond the illusion of the freedom to elect their leaders through controversial voting processes. Now that everything around us is collapsing and that our eyes are finally opening to the unsustainable nature of our politics, policies, businesses and general lifestyle, we have a window of opportunity to get to the root of the issues plaguing our development. Moreover, we have the exceptional opportunity to correct them and to be a generation of people who will go down in history, for having created lasting change for those who come after us. Unfortunately, many of us are still not ready for change. As I have said many times, change threatens some people\u2019s livelihood, their lazy, uncreative comfort, state sponsored weddings and champagne lifestyle, businesses based solely on import rather than export, round-tripping with foreign currency, failed bank loans given only to friends and family, the inability to legitimately provide goods and services that can survive without government as a customer, the unwillingness, finally, to lift the majority out of poverty, so they can become the consumer class with the spending power to access goods created and delivered by a new elite, one based on a currency of ideas rather than the prevalence of stolen money. Business integrity Wouldn\u2019t that be a wonderful country, one we could all be proud of? The truth is that too many of us would hate such a country, where hard work determines success, where business integrity and the rule of law determine outcomes rather than bandying about a corrupt name. This is the country Buhari\u2019s media handlers have been unable to describe. They\u2019ve been unable to make us want it, to make us understand why we must suffer for it, why our suffering this time is different, why, as the British say, we must get ready for one last \u201choorah\u201d, one last fight to wrench our nation from the clutches of those unfaithful to its great promise. The country even some of his ministers might neither know nor truly want. Yet, it is surely the country the President sees in his mind\u2019s eye. Tragically, he is practically alone in his quest for it: even we, the people who should be most concerned, have either given up or refuse to afford him the same chance we gave to all our previous leaders, simply because they bought our love and anaesthetised our ability to constructively criticise and see reality by introducing us to the opium our society has relished, corruption, the only dream we now know or recognise, one where individuals make money with no effort and no productive output. Now the country is broke and shall I add broken, we\u2019re awake and angry after surgical manipulations that rid us of all our internal organs, we\u2019re haemorrhaging fast, and now, ironically, we wake up to criticise and admonish: we should have done this long ago! On democracy day, we mark our return to civilian rule. Yet, we have never truly understood what democracy means, beyond the external imagery of elections. Our system has never been fully participatory, nor has it been inclusive or transparent. Our states are moribund administrative enclaves, creating nothing, attracting zero investment; the political class has operated separately from the society, feeding off of it yet giving nothing back, and we expected this to continue forever without a reckoning? Politics is the only business conducted in Nigeria. We have no real industries, the few we have are monopolies that allow the virtual concentration of wealth in the hands of a few. Furthermore, governance in Nigeria has never been for the people: how much infrastructural development has there been since 1999? Our country is still surviving on the roads and bridges built in the \u201970s and \u201980s, with not much more added. Yet the Federal Ministry of Works is allocated huge sums every year and contractors grow endlessly rich. The crisis (economic and security related) we face today has been in the making since our inception as a country, a combination of untenable factors: unproductive state(s), ethnic competition instead of nation-building conver-sations, over reliance on oil and a heinously unequal society. It is true that globally, the wealthy, as the economist Paul Krugman puts it, are less likely to show empathy or to respect the law but in our climes, it is simply because of the likelihood that once allegations of their misconduct comes up, they can pretend to be ill and receive sympathy from the same people they\u2019ve succeeded in robbing. There\u2019ll be no talk of public hospitals for them. Almost everything about the way we do business, the way we enact policies, the way we live our lives, has been wrong from the very beginning. We have accumulated mistakes, celebrated those who\u2019ve wronged us, and strangely, erroneously, believed we could continue limping along without collapsing. Proper monitoring The Finance Minister, Kemi Adeosun, made an interesting declaration recently, which wasn\u2019t dissected, proof of our acceptance or ignorance of where the real problems lie. She said the Federal Government discovered that agencies, in the past, received percentages of whatever funds were available, without proper monitoring of how funds were spent or whether disbursement translated to completed projects of not. Instead of this, funds will now only be released based on verifiable, identifiable milestones and the government will need to know what project the funds will be used for in the first place! How basic yet ironically, sadly revolutionary. Nigeria\u2019s main problem is both simple and very complex: it\u2019s corruption, stupid. We\u2019ve seen where the money goes. Yet, we\u2019ve said nothing, hoping our turn to partake in the fun will come. Now we\u2019re being forced to look at ourselves by a leader who isn\u2019t afraid of the ugly truths he finds hidden in our reflections. May we also find the courage to see ourselves for who we truly are. Sharia law and a \u2018dishonourable\u2019 house A certain Abdullahi Salame, a Sokoto State federal lawmaker, recently said in an interview that the speaker of the House of Representatives, Yakubu Dogara, recognising a bill to grant Sharia courts more powers, could cause \u201cpublic outrage\u201d asked the bill\u2019s sponsor(Salame) to \u201ckeep quiet about the bill\u201d. \u201cYou know there are some issues that it is not necessary to publicly discuss them or deliberate on them to avoid problems,\u201d Mr. Salame was quoted as saying. Where does one begin? The House cannot \u201chide\u201d or \u201ckeep quiet\u201d about its dealings, as the people\u2019s elected representatives, supposed \u201chonourables\u201d discuss and debate laws to develop citizens or so it is done in saner climes. What happened to Nigeria not having any particular state religion? Have we forgotten that part of the Constitution? President Obasanjo did immeasurable damage to this country by allowing Sharia law in a secular state; it was the beginning of ethnic, tribal and religious excuses for actions that belong in ancient history. Who will have the courage to tackle the Sharia courts? It\u2019s a question I\u2019ve asked before and to which I haven\u2019t, unfortunately, found an answer. Obasanjo IF the National Assembly seems incapable of any real oversight, if our \u201chonourables\u201d are only interested in dubious \u201cconstituency projects\u201d (one would think that with all the money spent on constituencies since 1999 they would all look like Dubai by now), one must look to his administration for answers. He is one of President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s greatest critics simply because, he, Buhari, is not an executive director or stakeholder of the mafia syndicate Nigeria Inc., and refuses to \u201csell out\u201d like all our leaders have done. Those who mean well for Nigeria need our prayers now more than ever because those who don\u2019t mean well are facing the greatest challenge to their survival, perhaps since Hope \u201993. Related",

        "author": "Tony Momoh",
        "text": "By Tony Momoh GANI Fawehinmi has left this part of the world he has been on and in for 71 years. All there is to say is how he faired. And that has been demonstrated since Saturday, September 5 when he passed on after a lonAg battle with an ailment we know little about worldwide, and we have refused to do even the little we can about here. It was cancer, one of the most debilitating and torturing health nuisances that have afflicted man. I should know because I had an experience with a cancer patient in the early 80s. We will come to that later, also to what is being done elsewhere and which we have failed to do here. Since his death last week, there has been so much flow of praises and commendations that you would think people are exaggerating. But not in any of the accolades was there any trace of describing a spade\u00c2 as more than an instrument for scooping igneous rock from terra firma? The facts of every case speak loud and clear for a hero who, unfortunately, will sooner than we think join the club of our heroes past whose labours are not reflected in the way we behave in public office, even in private life as the dirt in the financial sector has shown recently. Was he not the most qualified legal practitioner to be denied the silk for the most part of 20 years? Was he not detained more than 30 times because he promoted and fought causes he believed in? Was he not, more than any other lawyer in the history of Nigeria, a legal missile trained at the jugular of official corruption, fraud and indiscipline? Has there been any other legal practitioner in our history who promoted pro novo causes more than Gani, and who spent his earnings for the improvement of the status of the poor through funding their education? Is there anyone now or in the past who can rise up and claim to be close to Gani in commenting on issues of public interest; and doing more, going to court to fight them?\u00c2 Where is the one in our polity who so believed in himself that he even funded a political party to promote a dream he was aware would never be realized in a country that had perfected the art of stealing votes and celebrating the conquest with praises to God in churches and mosques! So, there is so much to say about this unstoppable advocate of law and order and discipline, but one who was uncompromising in support of the end rather than the means. There is a contradiction here. And he was not unmindful of such contradictions. He knew that the way some governors were removed from office was not constitutionally right, but he was more in support of their removal than the methods the EFCC used. In 1984 in my office as general manager of Times Publications Division, he would support the ads he placed during the Buhari/Idiagbon military administration that those who misused their powers must be dealt with and that since the administration was fighting corruption, it must be supported, in spite of the decrees that were globally condemned as hash. \"How else can they be in charge to clean this augean stable\"\u009d, he asked me then. So he would support the removal of governors outside obvious constitutional provisions insofar as they were corrupt. How then can we honour Gani?\u00c2 We cannot look in the direction of the law because to many of the entrenched ones in that club of gentlemen, he was a legal irritant. To the politician, he was not any better welcome. We should therefore seek, in memory of him, the way to tackle what afflicted him and which he fought without fear until he breathed his last. Can we not have a centre named after Gani to address the research, management and control of cancer, an ailment that makes you hold your breathe every day because you know that, being terminal, the one suffering\u00c2 will die, must die. In Tony Momoh Spiritual Essays (presented along with some other books on August 20), there is a chapter on cancer awareness and control. It was a speech I gave at a forum in Lagos. I told of the personal experience I had with a cancer patient for one year. She was my elder brother's wife, and she came over to Lagos and had to go to the Lagos University Teaching Hospital, LUTH. It was there that, after investigations which lasted almost three months, she was told that she had to live with only one breast! For a woman six feet tall, huge and complete with what makes women women, you can think of what she was being told about a distortion which would hang over the chest area, if she must live. She chose life. After this woman had lost her breast, the next port of call was the radiotherapy department. There were two radiotherapy machines there, but neither worked! The promise was made every time you went there that the machine would soon be operational! And people were right there, groaning, waiting for a machine to wake up and lessen the pains they were going through; waiting to take the next step to adjust to life after they had lost a breast. But here was a woman on my hands, confident that the necessary follow-\u00c2 \u00c2 up to the surgery she had undergone would soon provide an opportunity to adjust to a life without a breast. And the hospital where there ought to have been everything you needed to assure recovery from your ailment had no facility to save the life of a woman who had lost her breast to cancer.\u00c2 The nearest place for the post-surgery treatment was Liberia! The woman died. Have things changed? The fact is that things have not changed, more than 20 years after. So what can we do to immortalize Gani, the one who while suffering from the killing ailment, still wrote and pushed across to us those things he believed we ought to have done to make life more tolerable for the average citizen. If there is no monument we can raise in memory of him, let us follow others who are asking what the cause of cancer is and the place of the liver in its treatment and control. The truth about cancer is that we still do not know the cause. But it does have a cause. I must at this stage call for help from research based on the intimation given in 1929 when someone asked Abd-ru-shin, author of the Grail Message In the Light of Truth, a question on cancer research. This is what he said, \"Any cancerous growth is conditioned by the incapacity and insufficient activity of the liver! This must be borne in mind. A healthy liver with a really normal activity does not permit any kind of cancer to develop\"\u00a6 With the recovery of the liver the power of the illness is broken, no matter where it is located.\"\u009d (Abd-ru-shin, Questions and Answers, p 225). In his The Little Doctor, D.A. Vogel says, \"The liver is the most important barrier in the fight against cancer. As long as this miraculous laboratory is functioning well, a cancerous degeneration of the cells cannot take place.\u00c2 Since the liver thereby occupies a key position in the fight against cancer, we should seek to maintain it for ourselves as an efficient barrier because, as has been stated before, cancer will then be given no opportunity to develop.\"\u009d Let Gani's death prompt us to do something about our heroes past. As the saying goes,\u00c2 \"Better late than never\"\u009d. Related",

        "author": "Tony Momoh",
        "text": "By Tony Momoh A COUNTRY would not be a country if it was not anchored on laws. But a country can be described as one without laws where it has laws that are not enforced or that are enforced more in the breach than the observance. I am a patriot, which is saying boastfully that I love Nigeria as much as anyone else would claim. But I want to continue to be a proud Nigerian if it is being seen worldwide as a country of laws. I regret that as is, it is no more than a country with laws. And this is worse than a country without laws! There is a difference between a country of laws and a country with laws on the one hand; and a country of laws and a country without laws on the other. A country of laws is one in which the law is supreme in moderating the relationships between people and people, between people and government, and between governments and governments. In a country of laws, everyone is equal before the law. In there, the chief law officer is the chief law officer because he proffers advice on the operation of the law in line with the anchor law of the country, which is the constitution. A country of laws earns being referred to as a country of laws because those who assess it look into its operation of the laws it has accepted as part and parcel of the tools it has chosen to enable its citizens walk the road they had chosen to take, with a sense of justice grounded on the rule of law. The grounding is a historical fact, not fiction. America is a country of laws. Israel is a country of laws. India is a country of laws. China, Japan, South Africa, they are all countries of laws because they do not only ensure that there are laws that moderate the affairs of the people, but also that those laws are applied to those who breach them. As I wrote this piece, there was a news item on Fox News about a high profile movie maker in the United States who had been imprisoned. What did he do? In the 70s, he raped a 15-year-old girl. The long arm of the law caught up with him and he was jailed because, in a country of laws, there is no lifespan for a crime. But in a country with laws that are showcases in the books, and in a country without laws, crime pays because it has both life and span. It is a vehicle for accessing wealth and those opposed to such deadly ways can even be sacrificed to please the untouchables.\u00c2 In a country of laws, there is no class of untouchables. A country without laws is not a country, cannot be a country. A country is a country because it has laws that established it, that sustain it because they are applied without fear or favour. I have not even one example to show you in respect of a country without laws. If you have one, please send me a text message. But what of a country with laws which are not obeyed?\u00c2 This is the problem I have with my country. It is more a country with laws than a country without laws. But I want to be persuaded that it is a country of laws. You may ask what led to this seemingly mindless exercise. It was what I saw in the October 19 issue of Newswatch Magazine. Go to page 21 of that issue and see what can happen in a country without laws or a country which just has laws and no more. The title of the story is Robbed of His Mandate. I would not touch it if this had been one stray case of a legal lapse. But it is the summary of life in a country with laws that are not enforced in spite of the clear constitutional provision that every citizen, every organ of government, every institution, has an obligation to obey the laws of the land as interpreted by the courts. In this case, the National Assembly has failed to obey a court order since it was given in February this year. It wants to give reasons for doing so. INEC is to produce the material that would enable the Clerk of the National Assembly carry out what the courts have decided. INEC has failed to produce the material as directed by the court because its legal adviser had said it should wait for the outcome of motions filed in respect of the matter. Two in-house lawyers of\u00c2 INEC advised against failure to abide by the court's order, but INEC has the legal opinion from the office of the attorney-general that the order of the court should not be carried out until the issues outstanding are resolved! Even the attorney-general's office has not followed up to find out whether there were such issues and what had become of them! The case is one of whom among two candidates of the Peoples Democratic Party in Akwa Ibom will represent the Uyo Federal Constituency. Bassey Etim is the one at the House of Representatives. Emmanuel Obot is the one who went to court to claim that he was the one who ought to have been there. Obot had won the primaries of the party, but was replaced on the recommendation of the EFCC. EFCC, if it wanted to have business to do with those contesting elections, would have produced an order of a court about anybody's wrongdoing to enable INEC disqualify such a person. But the party did replace Obot with Bassey. Obot protested that irregularity and the election tribunal upheld his claim. Bassey went on appeal to the Court of Appeal which is the highest court to go to in respect of elections to the National Assembly. Only presidential elections end up at the Supreme Court. Bassey lost at the Court of Appeal which voided the certificate issued to him by the INEC and ordered that Obot be returned as the duly elected representative of Uyo Federal Constituency to the House of Representatives of the National Assembly. That was on February 12, 2009. That, in a country of laws, would be the end of the matter. But in a country without laws or with laws that just litter the books, wonders never end. Bassey appealed to the Supreme Court! Not just that. His lawyer wrote a letter to Maurice Iwu asking him to stay obedience of the order of the Court of Appeal pending the determination of the appeal to the Supreme Court. Wonder of wonders! For reasons that can only be acceptable in a country without laws, Iwu has not issued the certificate ordered to be issued in February, nine full months after. Even the Supreme Court threw out the appeal, telling Bassey that they were not looking for jurisdiction of other courts to take over. Which was saying, simply, that all election matters at that level could not go beyond the Court of Appeal. Even after there had been written confirmation from the Supreme Court that no matter in respect of the election was pending before it, Iwu has not handed over the certificate to a man the courts have declared duly elected. We are asking for many things to ensure that this country grows. If we have shown our indiscipline in everything we do, must we be this insensitive to extend it to the domain of the courts? I love this country, and I have no other to call my own. But please help us, those of you\u00c2 performing gate-keeping roles, to ensure that we work according to our briefs, anchored in the rule of law. I vote for a country of laws, not a country without laws or one that just parades its laws! And you? Related",

        "author": "Douglas Anele",
        "text": "By Douglas Anele Five days from now, it would be Christmas once again, an indication of the cyclic nature of time. As usual with the weeks and days leading up to it, preparations for the celebrations are gathering momentum in all the nooks and crannies of the globe. In the major cities of Nigeria, Santa Claus\u2019s white-bearded cheery face is emblazoned at shop entrances and windows. A visit to the major markets and shopping malls in Lagos and commercial centres all over the country is a tedious undertaking at this time, because everybody is hustling about, pulling and pushing all in a bid to buy one thing or another. Of course, petty thieves and pickpockets are on the prowl, cleverly stealing from people\u2019s handbags and pockets. And given the ubiquity of Internet technology and explosion in electronic transactions, fraudsters are working hard looking for victims to defraud. Business people and transporters are already implementing strategies aimed at profit maximisation. Unfortunately, with the growing hardship in the country right now, millions of Nigerians would not enjoy the Yuletide the way they would have wanted. Many of the roads in the country, especially federal roads in the South-East, are in a terrible state of disrepair, which means that road accidents will likely increase from now till after the New Year celebrations. According to \u201cThe Truth about Christmas,\u201d an informative essay on Christmas published in the December 2010 edition of Awake, Christmas celebration has spread to non-Christian countries such as China, Indonesia, Japan, Lebanon and Turkey. The article reports that in the West, Christmas has metamorphosed into a secular moneymaking enterprise, with many advertorials blatantly targeted towards children. Millions of Christians still go to church on Christmas day in the pretext of commemorating the birth of the purported \u201csaviour of mankind,\u201d whereas their real intention is to show off their expensive new clothes, shoes, bags etc. Meanwhile, the well-decorated shopping malls playing Christmas carols have become the new temples. Because of relentless commercialisation, people are unduly agitated and worried over how to buy Christmas gifts for their loved ones. Some of them borrow money in order to meet the expectations of family members and friends. Overspending during Christmas has become an unfortunate feature of a supposedly spiritual event. From the foregoing, there is no patina of doubt that Christmas, which is supposed to mark the birthday of Jesus Christ, the most iconic spiritual teacher in human history (according to Christians), has evolved into the celebration of rabid materialism, debauchery and showy exhibitionism. But how did this come about? Is the transformation due to the largely non-Christian origin of Christmas itself, or is it an inevitable product of rampaging capitalism? Looking at the historical basis of Christmas, was the figure described as Jesus of Nazareth a genuine historical figure or were the narratives concerning him an admixture of fact and myth \u2013 more of myth, in fact? If there was indeed a historical Jesus, was he actually born on Christmas day, that is, 25th of December? What are the historical origins of Christmas? Attempts to answer these questions can open up fresh and interesting vistas of thought concerning one of the most celebrated festivals in human history. Most Christians, particularly in Nigeria, do not know that Christmas celebrations developed from non-Christian sources. Tradition has it that Jesus was actually born on December 25, and his birthday is celebrated on that date. Indeed, \u2018Christmas\u2019 means \u2018Christ\u2019s Mass,\u2019 that is, the mass commemorating the feast of Christ\u2019s nativity, or birth. The Christmas Encyclopaedia states that canonisation of December 25 as Jesus\u2019 birthday did not evolve from biblical precedent, but from Roman festivals held at the end of every year, about the time of winter solstice in the Northern Hemisphere. Those festivals included the Saturnalia, in honour of Saturn, god of agriculture, and the combined festivals of two sun gods, Sol and Mithra from Rome and Persia respectively. Both birthdays were celebrated on 25th of December, the winter solstice, according to the Julian calendar. The metamorphosis or adaptation of these celebrations into Christian practice began in 350 A.D., when Pope Julius 1 proclaimed December 25 a Christ\u2019s birthday. The nativity gradually absorbed and supplanted all other solstice rites, while solar imagery became increasingly prominent in depicting the notion of \u201cthe risen Christ\u201d or sol invictus, and the old solar disk was transformed into haloes around the heads of Christian saints. Now, granted that The Bible contains narratives of questionable historicity, and although, contrary to what most Christians believe, the question of whether the individual named Jesus in the Gospels actually existed is far from settled, Christmas celebration was never recommended in the Christian scripture. Indeed, The Bible did not state the actual date Jesus was born \u2013 it merely gave geographical indications surrounding the birth and early circumstances of Jesus. In Luke 2:8, for instance, The Bible suggests that when Jesus was born, shepherds were living out of doors herding their sheep at night near Bethlehem. Meteorologically speaking, October usually marks the commencement of the cold rainy season in the area of Christ\u2019s nativity, and at such period shepherds, especially in the colder highlands such as those around Bethlehem, brought their flock into protected shelters at night. The coldest weather, occasionally accompanied by snow, usually occurred in December, making that period inappropriate for shepherds to tend their animals at night. Thus, it appears that, judging from biblical account concerning the birth of Jesus and the weather condition of Bethlehem and its environs, it is unlikely that he was born in December. Another work published by the Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses, entitled Insight on the Scriptures suggests, that Jesus was born during the ancient Jewish month of ethanim, that is, in September or October. As already indicated, The Bible does not contain any account about Jesus celebrating his birthday, nor recommendation by Jesus or any of his twelve disciples that it should be celebrated by his followers. The pioneer Christians, some of whom accompanied Jesus in his missionary work, never celebrated it on any date. But interestingly, during the last supper with his twelve disciples, Jesus asked them to commemorate his death, probably indicating that his death is a momentous event for his followers (Luke 22: 17-20). Two of the most popular manifestations of mythology in modern Christmas are the phenomenon of Santa Claus and the Christmas tree, the latter arising from ancient superstition connected to the god of agriculture. In many countries today, including Nigeria, it is generally believed by children that Santa Claus actually brings presents to them. Children regularly write to Santa asking for presents which, according to tradition, elves help him to manufacture in his headquarters at the North Pole. There is a popular account of the myth of Santa Claus which claims that it was invented by the legendary Saint Nicholas, Archbishop of Myra in Asia Minor (Turkey). Probably, therefore, the appellation \u2018Santa Claus\u2019 could have originated from Sinterklaas, a corruption of the Dutch expression for \u2018Saint Nicholas.\u2019 Needless to say, there is no mention of Santa Claus in The Bible, which implies that the cheery, red-faced fabrication that goes by that name has absolutely nothing to do with the birth of Jesus.

        "text": "By Douglas Anele Read first part here Any sincere open-minded person who investigates Christmas would conclude that almost everything about the celebration is either non-Christian in origin or a distortion of what is written in The Bible. Hence, Christmas is an accretion of myths and legends that allows Christians to celebrate the purported saviour of humankind. Sometime in the past, church leaders tried very hard to fight against \u201cheathen\u201d customs in Christianity. But as time went on, they changed their attitude and gradually condoned, and eventually embraced, those practices. That change came about because church authorities were much more interested in filling the churches with worshippers than with spreading spiritual truth and enlightenment, an aspiration that has even worsened today. Pentecostal pastors especially have perfected the art of obtaining through false pretences and lies by teaching prosperity and instant miracles. Some of the big Pentecostal churches are regularly filled to the brim with gullible \u201ccustomers\u201d who are eager to swallow completely all that they are told by their pastors. Thus, it is not surprising that a celebration allegedly celebrating the birth of Jesus, a spiritual leader, has become an excuse for drunkenness and debauchery of all kinds. Supermarkets have become more popular than places of worship, which are now looking more and more like corporate headquarters of multinational companies. After Yuletide, many families sink further into debt buying mostly what they do not really need, and many Christians confuse fantasy with reality and Santa Claus with Jesus of Nazareth. In a word, the spiritual core of Christmas has almost been swallowed up by crass materialism. But it is not just the spiritual essence of the occasion that is endangered \u2013 more significant is that the whole concept of virgin birth of \u201csaviour of the world\u201d is open to question too. For centuries, serious investigators and scholars of the New Testament have attempted to answer the deceptively simple question: was there, in fact, a human being called Jesus, as described in the gospels? It is obvious that this question is of fundamental importance to Christianity, since if the gospel accounts of Jesus are largely fabrication and myth, then the impressive edifice of Christianity would come crashing down. Put differently, any good evidence that the stories about Jesus are myths with very little basis in reality is a big blow to the Christian religion, and seriously undermines its claim as the only God-approved route to salvation. Of course, no \u201cgenuine\u201d Christian would cast aspersions on the gospel narratives concerning Jesus, knowing that unquestioned acceptance of the Nazarene as the saviour of humankind is non-negotiable. Therefore, let us briefly examine the views of researchers on the subject-matter to help us arrive at a reasoned conclusion concerning it. Alfred Reynolds, in his highly informative work, Jesus versus Christianity, stated clearly that, going by historical sources, we know virtually nothing about Jesus. He asserts further that the New Testament cannot be regarded as a historical document since the extant copies were written by believers, in foreign countries and in Greek language, over several decades after the events they describe occurred. Without question, the so-called synoptic gospels contradict one another to the extent that it would be a grave mistake to accept them all as valid historical source materials. It is remarkable that the great Roman historians of the first and second centuries A.D. did not even mention Jesus in their works, which suggests that probably they did not know him. Christian apologists usually cite as historical evidence of Jesus\u2019 actual existence the statement attributed to Josephus, a Jewish priest and historian who, in A.D. 93, was supposed to have written, inter alia: \u201cNow, there was about this time Jesus, a wise man if it be lawful to call him a man, for he was a doer of wonderful works; a teacher of such men as receive the truth with pleasure.\u201d But some scholars, for instance Edward Gibbon, the English historian (1737-1794), have questioned the authenticity of this passage, alleging that it was a later fabrication and interpolation into the text of Josephus. George Brandeis, in his Jesus Myth, puts forward the idea that Jesus never lived, and that all the legends concerning him are mere accretions of mythical qualities on a composite figure. Similarly, an outstanding scholar of Christological research, Prof. G. A. Wells, in two remarkable books, Jesus of the early Christians and Did Jesus Exist? argued persuasively that the character Jesus, as presented in the gospels, is a myth. There is a tendency among modern theologians to reject the dogmatic components about Jesus\u2019 birth, life, death and resurrection; demythologising him without having the courage to acknowledge or accept that the churches will collapse if the myths and mystical elements in Christianity are so hastily abandoned. Another serious scholar that expressed doubts about the actual existence of Jesus is the missionary, philosopher and historian, Albert Schweitzer (1875-1965), whose magnum opus, Quest of the Historical Jesus, is a groundbreaking work in Christological investigation. Despite the fact that he was a missionary, he was bold enough to aver that: \u201cThe Jesus who came forward publicly as the messiah, who preached the ethic of the kingdom of God, who founded the kingdom of heaven on earth, and died to give his work final consecration, never had any existence. He is a figure designed by rationalism, endowed with life by liberalism, and clothed by modern theology in a historical garb.\u201d Schweitzer, along with one of the most eminent researchers into New Testament history, Johannes Weiss, believe that the critical importance of Jesus does not lie in his historicity but in the eschatological and messianic teachings attributed to him. The renowned English playwright, George Bernard Shaw, proclaimed that although there was probably a man called Jesus, his relevance lay in the political, economic, and moral ideas which he espoused. In Androcles and the Lion, Shaw argued that: \u201cthere is a man here who was sane until Peter hailed him as Christ, and who then became a monomaniac\u2026his is a common delusion among the insane\u2026and such insanity is quite consistent with argumentative cunning and penetration which Jesus displayed in Jerusalem after his delusion has taken complete hold of him. He was a communist\u2026he regarded much of what we call law and order as a machinery for robbing the poor under legal forms.\u201d Josiah Royce, the American philosopher, suggested that the significance of Jesus of Nazareth is attributable to \u201cthe vital impetus\u201d his teachings and activities had given to a powerful event, the emergence of Christianity. According to Royce: \u201cin answer to the challenge, either you must believe that the founder of Christianity was only a man, or else you must accept Jesus as the Christ, the divine man; we must fairly reply\u2026Whatever may be the truth about the person of Christ, and about the supposed supernatural origin of Christianity, the human origin of the christian doctrine of life, and also the human source of all the latter Christologies, must be found in the early Christian community itself.

        "text": "By Douglas Anele Read A critical phenomenology of Christmas (2) The Christian religion in its early form is the work and expression of the Christian church. But we cannot say that, speaking of Jesus as an individual man, we know that he explicitly intended to found the Christian church.\u201d Now that we have looked at Christmas and the views of some scholars concerning the status and historicity of Jesus, let us harvest the main fruits of our discourse. First of all, whatever the historical status of Jesus of Nazareth, it is incontrovertible that Christmas, as it is being celebrated worldwide, has no biblical warrant. It is the crystallisation of superstitious ideas and practices drawn from ancient Rome and other Mediterranean communities that constitute the substance of the Gospels. The Bible does not contain a precise statement of the actual day and month when Jesus was born. It follows that Christmas celebration is not based on actual historical event. We have noted already how Pope Julius 1 imposed that date on Christendom, although the Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses have consistently refused to mark the birthday of Jesus on December 25, or on any other day, because, according to the sect, he never commanded his followers to celebrate it. A devout Christian is likely to consider it sacrilegious if anyone expresses scepticism about whether Jesus of the Gospels actually lived. However, Christian dogmatism and sentiments apart, there is no solid evidence to back the claim that he did, or that the narratives in Matthew, Mark, Luke and John are historical records of real events. Indeed, there is abundant evidence indicating that Jesus is a composite figure created from the synthesis of ancient Egyptian, Persian, Greek, and Roman mythological traditions, blended with some strand of the messianic tradition in Judaism. These facts, and more, are well known to serious students of the New Testament. Therefore, as believers celebrate Christmas, they should bear in mind that the event is more of mythology and fantasy than reality. And no matter how blasphemous it might appear to the faithful, they should know that there are good reasons for thinking that Jesus Christ, as depicted in the New Testament, is a myth as well. There might well have been a bohemian Jewish rabbi born around 4 B.C., who taught a form of Judaism different from the conventional version. But all the supernatural attributes and occurrences attributed to Jesus in The Bible were derived from, and are analogous to, superstitions and legends in ancient Mediterranean and Oriental worlds. Take the story of virgin birth, which is very popular in many antiquated communities. In ancient Egyptian mythology, for instance, the god, Toth, was said to announce the forthcoming birth of a son to the virgin-queen Mautmes. In Persian mythology, Saoshyas, the future savior of mankind and conqueror of death, was miraculously conceived by his virgin-mother from the seed of Zarathustra, who himself was born of a fifteen year old virgin, Dughdova, after the latter had been visited by a shaft of light from the supernatural realm. Indian mythology proclaims that Krishna was born from the rib of a virgin who belonged to the royal line of Devaci. Even Buddha was said to have been born through divine intervention, not through the natural process. It is clear, from the foregoing, that the myth of virgin birth is not unique to Christianity. We have examined the Christian celebration, Christmas, and concluded that it is not biblical. We have thrown doubt on the historicity of the character named Jesus, indicated that even if there was one, he probably was not born in December 25, and drawn attention to the fact that the miraculous stories in the gospels stories about Jesus also exist in other world religions. The implication of all this is that the historical basis of Christmas celebrations is extremely weak. Evidently, belief in Jesus, his virgin birth and alleged mission on earth are both mythological and eschatological at the same time. They are mythological because the key events, such as his virgin birth and purported resurrection, are ruled out by science. They are eschatological given the fact that Jesus\u2019 birth is ultimately meaningful because it has a redemptive mission for believers in the so-called judgment or last day when God would judge humankind. For Christians, the significance of Jesus\u2019 birth does not lie in its historicity or in its agreement with the research findings of science. Rather, the \u201ccoming of the son of man\u201d is a momentous event in human history since it provides a unique opportunity for humans, especially \u201cthe chosen ones,\u201d to be reconciled with God after the Original Sin. Yet, for an unapologetic unbeliever like me, the Jesus narratives instantiate the futile efforts of humanity to project its fears, hopes, anxieties, dreams and aspirations to an imaginary divine realm where the glaring evils and imperfections in the real world would be eliminated. It is unfortunate that a religion, which ought to help humanity grow spiritually, has become an instrument of deceit, glorification of self-indulgent materialism, and plain fraud. Ordinarily, one would wish that Christianity, and therewith, the Christmas celebrations associated with it, would be consigned to the dustbin of history. Unfortunately, that is not likely to happen any time soon, because religion is an attempts to satisfy, in a grossly inadequate and mostly irrational manner I must say, certain existential needs of humans. Moreover, as long as human beings continue to waste scare resources of the earth in planning to kill each other instead of deploying their incredible cognitive and emotional intelligence to reduce drastically both manmade and existential evils, religion will continue to play an important role in the lives of billions of people globally. With specific reference to the Nigerian situation, it is obvious that for millions of people, this year\u2019s celebrations would not be as enjoyable as they expected at the beginning of the year. Things are generally difficult, and the government of President Muhammadu Buhari is grappling with the serious challenges of nation building in a stochastic economic environment characterised by dwindling crude oil prices and steady decline in the value of the naira in relation to other currencies such as the dollar, pound sterling and euro. Fortunately, Nigerians are very resilient people. Despite the hardships, people would eat, drink and make merry during Christmas. In my opinion, however, the best way to celebrate the occasion is for those that have to share with those that do not have. It is silly for one to have too much to drink, too much to eat and even throw away when there are thousands of people who do not have enough to eat and enjoy the festive season. At this time, and always, we should be our brothers\u2019 keepers, in the knowledge that inspite of our differences, we are all members of the same family who need one another to be fully human. Merry Christmas in arrears to everyone. Concluded. Related",

        "author": "Rotimi Fasan",
        "text": "By Rotimi Fasan IT\u2019s no longer news that all hasn\u2019t been well between Chibuike R. Amaechi, RiversState governor, and President Goodluck Jonathan. The outcome of the contest for the leadership of the Governors Forum which Amaechi won in spite of efforts to thwart his ambition by forces in the PDP believed to be working for President Jonathan has only accentuated what had lain hidden for so long. In spite of denials by the Presidency, the latest being the one by Reuben Abati in the immediate aftermath of the Governors Forum\u2019s election, many Nigerians know better than to believe that President Jonathan is uninterested in the outcome of the election. Or put differently, many believe Abuja would rather not have Amaechi returned as Chairman of the Forum which has in the last few years assumed far more significance than one would ordinarily expect of an informal gathering that it is supposed to be. Yet this informal association has widened the breach in the relationship between two South-South politicians that probably started for reasons traceable not to any personal animosity between them but the bad blood generated by the outburst of Mrs. Patience Jonathan who embarrassingly chided Governor Amaechi for actions she considered targeted against the good of her people. It is not impossible that in the many months since this open attack on Governor Amaechi, Mrs Jonathan has succeeded in turning her personal antagonism for the Governor into her husband\u2019s. It wouldn\u2019t be too far-fetched then to believe that the unfolding drama between Jonathan and Amaechi is traceable to Patience. Now things have fallen apart and one of the two parties involved in this bruising fight is claiming his life is in danger. We may be having a glimpse of just how messy things could get before they\u2019ll get better, if ever things could get better between these men again. But then these are politicians and nothing changes ever so often among them as the friends they keep. This may be timely warning to those presently queuing up behind both men in anticipation of the battle ahead. When this hurly-burly is over and done with, the collateral damage would belong to the unfortunate bystanders who chose to turn mere politicians\u2019 battles into their own private war. Yet the truth must be out- Jonathan, no matter how he tries, has shown himself to be behind the war drum that seeks to drown out Amaechi\u2019s victory song and, if possible, his political career. Even if Patience may be indirectly responsible for the animosity between Jonathan and Amaechi, the ambition of both men has done much to worsen that relationship. Not many outside the South-South are enthusiastic about another term for President Jonathan but finding a suitable replacement for him has been a touchy issue. The assumption has been that challenge to his continued stay in office could only come from among politicians of Northern extraction, a product that might be very difficult to sell. But a politician from within the Niger-Delta even if only paired as Vice President with another from the North changes the game for Jonathan and he knows it. For quite a long time now, the news has been around town that Amaechi, a two-time governor, might be nursing presidential ambitions. In recent times, the story has taken on a life of its own and this must have unsettled Jonathan in no small way. There is no doubt that many Nigerian politicians at some level believe themselves superior to Jonathan, especially those who were already governors before fortune smiled on him to make him their boss. They also couldn\u2019t see what this President has done to make him more qualified for the office of president than they. Jonathan probably not only senses this in the action and utterances of some of these politicians but also feels it viscerally. He senses the lack of respect if not disdain, a point a woman as ambitious as his wife would drum into him until he begins to act in the crude manner that expresses itself in the kind of unconscionable display of power that led, first, to the grounding of Amaechi\u2019s plane and later the attempt to prevent his return to the seat of chair of the Governors Forum. This is not saying that Amaechi is entirely blameless in the matter or that he was right to be flying an aircraft without proper licence if one could justify his flying an aircraft at all in a state whose public transport system is the same nightmare it is in every other state. But the point is that it took the disagreement between him and Jonathan to alert the aviation authorities to this apparent violation of air safety regulations. The build-up to the election that produced Amaechi as chair of the Governors Forum was fraught with expectations and many could have mistaken it for a contest into some elective office recognised by the Constitution. It was clear the Presidency had an interest in the outcome and was in fact sponsoring candidates. Thus, when the result came and Amaechi was announced winner or was reported to have won, it all seemed like a defeat for the President. It\u2019s, therefore, not surprising that the PDP would crudely join the fight by suspending Amaechi from their party for so-called anti-party activities that couldn\u2019t in their reckoning be resolved without further violations of laid down procedures. Nobody should be trusted with power and by the manner Jonathan has played his hand in the entire saga, he has shown himself to be no better than his predecessors in office. Especially President Obasanjo who many believe could very often appropriate state power for purely private battles. Jonathan, the barefooted boy from Otuoke, could prove a poor but more deadly student of the Obasanjo School of Power Profiteers. Related",

        "text": "By Obi Nwakanma Nigerians are obviously by now already too numbed by the reports of public corruption at the highest places. There\u2019s very little that is new about public corruption, nor anything in any scale now shocking or surprising about corruption in Nigeria. News of public corruption which could still scandalize and shock people in other places, and even sometimes make the devil blush with embarrassment, is now considered quite routine in Nigeria. Nigeria has hit rock bottom and has nowhere else to go. The scandals these past two weeks that have erupted, first around the National Pension Fund, and then more recently, the oil subsidy scam, in more civilized places would bring down a government. But in Nigeria, it is an occasion for endless analysis and hand-wring. It is also an example of what Mr. Philip Asiodu in a recent interview very poignantly described as a \u201cculture of competitive corruption.\u201d Philip Asiodu told a quite remarkable, almost improbable story of a civil servant in a now bygone era who had just been promoted after many years as a Clerk to an assistant executive officer position. Part of his entitlement was a low interest car loan, for which he quickly applied. Thing was, the man was approaching his retirement, and had just one year to get to the bar, when he would retire based on age. The age bar was nonetheless not the issue. He had rightly applied for a car loan. But he chose not to buy a car, but instead to use the money paid out to him as a car advance, to build a house, since he was near retirement. The issue was also not whether he could repay the loan, but according to the civil service rules, he had acted fraudulently and improperly by leveraging a car loan and putting it, not to the purpose for which the service approved the loan, but to the quite different purpose of property development. The civil service instituted, first a query, and thereafter, a board of investigations, which was about to indict the poor fellow. To make this brief, the old man chose suicide rather than face the disgrace. Contrast that with today, he asks us, when a public official who is caught in the scandal of placing the national pension fund in his private account, remains defiant to the point of summoning irrationality \u2013 the claim of unfair persecution andunnecessary attention. How dare we persecute him? Is he the only one doing it? Everybody does it. Well, here is the point of it, dear reader: everybody does it and therefore guilt is selective and subjective value. People steal public funds and are celebrated in their communities. But imagine the sums named in these scandals. Billions of naira. Nigerians no longer talk in \u201cordinary\u201d millions. The project is to destroy Nigeria by all necessary means \u2013 this is exactly what these activities are \u2013 they aim at its financial jugular. But I did ask you to imagine this: how could just a handful of individuals have the authority, beyond the processes of regulation and control, to amass and appropriate public fund at that magnitude? It simply means that there is a fundamentally structural leak in the design of Nigeria\u2019s public administration. Public fund is now privately handled. Accounting controls are manipulated, and auditing has been left in the hands of easily malleable processes that undermine the integrity of Nigeria\u2019s public finance administration. I will come to this matter presently, but let me draw attention to another scam \u2013 bigger and more portent in its implication: the N1.7 Trillion oil subsidy fraud recently uncovered by the Lawan Fraouk committee of the Federal House of Representatives. The Farouk committee report paints a profoundly gory picture of a country squeezed to death by the greed of a few privileged oligopolists, who suck her resources dry. This past two weeks have seen a flurry of debates around explosive revelations, following parliamentary inquiry about the oil subsidy fraud in the Petroleum ministry, the PPRA and the expenditures under the petroleum Support Fund. In one instance, N999 million was allegedly paid 128 times within twenty four hours to the same beneficiary. As part of its recommendations, and in utter dismay for negligent complicity, the Lawan Farouk reports recommended the termination of the services of Akintola Williams-Deloite, and Adekanola groups of Accounting firms; but above all, their prosecution. I think it is about time too. It is about time to bring them all out \u2013 hand and feet \u2013 including the named individuals like former Account-General of the federation, Mr. Dankwabo, current Accountant-General, John Otunla, former minister for finance, Segun Aganga, former Director of the Budget Office, Dr. Bright Okogu, and all those who may have questions to answer on this affair. Indeed, by the now, the minister of Petroleum, Mrs. Diezani Madueke ought to have handed in her resignation, to give way to a more transparent process. Nigerians now need to keep their eyes wide open on the outcomes of this process. It has to be said, that Mister, the honorable Lawan Farouk and his committee, has done their sworn duties to the nation as legislators by exposing this terrible miasma. I did read that the president has promised full compliance with the report. I should say, at this stage, it is no longer up to the president to prosecute. It is now up to the justice and enforcement arm of the federation to prosecute and punish as should be necessary for the purposes of deterrence. It is up to the police and the Attorney-General\u2019s office to develop the case and arraign people before proper courts for prosecution under Nigeria\u2019s criminal laws. It is also imperative, for the president to demand the immediate resignation of any of his appointees who have been named in these scams. We must be clear nonetheless: the Lawan Farouk report is but a mere tip of the iceberg. The petroleum ministry is a cauldron of corruption. We are yet to know the full details of the activities of this ministry, particularly through the eight years of the Obasanjo administration, to date. The KPMG report must be made public and enforced alongside the current report by of the Federal House of Representatives. Nigeria\u2019s stolen wealth must be recovered, and those who have made capital of exploiting Nigeria, and making it difficult for Nigerians to have the fullest benefits of their natural resources because of corrupt practices are the enemies of the land; far more dangerous and subversive than Boko Haram. Those who steal must be jailed. It is the law. It is not up to the president. Related",

        "author": "Tabia Princewill",
        "text": "By Tabia Princewill A LOT has been said about petitions by civil society groups asking the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission, EFCC, to investigate alleged \u201cquestionable expenditures\u201d by the former governor of Lagos, Babatunde Fashola, including a much commented upon N78 million website upgrade which the firm contracted to do the job subsequently denied receiving such an amount for. Even among our best, claims of corruption remain an issue and there are two categories of reactions to such affairs, where Nigerians are concerned: some offer blind and unwavering support to their \u201cheroes\u201d, particularly those whose mien promised a strong, honest, people-oriented character, while others are quick to judge and condemn, based on political calculations, while often refusing to see the log in their own eye. It is difficult in Nigeria, to find men and women one can admire without having to defend them at one point or another against accusations of graft or impropriety of some kind. Everyone has a past in Nigeria, all that differs seems to be the extent of the wrongs they are accused of; or in other words, how dark precisely, their past is and how comfortable the rest of us are with the murky waters one must tread to keep up with their colourful lives. One is reminded of a quote by Oscar Wilde: \u201cEvery saint has a past and every sinner has a future\u201d. It is in fact, the story of the Nigerian political system and could serve as an anthem to characterise our political dealings. Political dealings Indeed, with General Babangida claiming in interviews to mark his 74th birthday, to miss his old \u201cfriend\u201d, M.K.O Abiola, one really sees that there is a time for self-avowed redemption for everyone. A time where re-invention of one\u2019s story seems to be the only possible course. Nigeria has been a victim of this. Every sinner wishes to become a saint which is why former President Olusegun Obasanjo, who some might say \u201cgave\u201d former President Goodluck Jonathan to Nigerians, became one of his most prominent critics once he saw the tide turning. Former Military President, Gen. Ibrahim Babangida In political history all over the world, you find characters who survive all revolutions, who are present despite every great change. In France, the name \u201cTalleyrand\u201d is synonymous with political cynicism and survival, maintained prominence through all regimes despite who is in power. Talleyrand was a French politician whose career spanned monarchies and democracies in 19th century France. So Nigerians didn\u2019t invent the \u201cAny- Government-In-Power\u201d mantra but we definitely perfected it. Our leaders are masters of re-invention but for the first time in our political history, we are about to see real change: it will be difficult for our elite to tell fanciful stories about themselves or how they made their money, to hide their colourful past and present dealings behind brash, untenable statements (although Governor Ayo Fayose might disagree with this assessment). Things are about to get serious again in Nigeria. As citizens, we are fed up of being misled by leaders who have no regard for our sensibilities as humans beings or for our yearnings for truth and justice. Nigerians will no longer accept the excuse given by politicians who claim allegations of corruption are simply political attacks. No one is too big to fall in this administration, as the Presidency has assured Nigerians it will not protect any guilty individuals from facing the law. Jealousy and rifts between godfathers and godsons cannot be the motivation behind allegations or accusations of corruption: the fight is too important, the need to kill corruption before it kills Nigerians is too severe to taint with petty ego and power driven squabbles which have no meaningful impact on Nigerians, besides drawing attention from the real enemy, the mindless stealing which has become part of our political culture. The APC estimates N13.972 trillion was allegedly squandered by the Jonathan administration in the oil sector alone. However, if we were to look at other industries and also compute indebtedness in states such as Lagos, Osun, Rivers and Kano, which incidentally are APC-led states, the figure would be much higher. The problem with corruption in Nigeria isn\u2019t an APC or a PDP problem: it is one of mediocrity. Nigerians have accepted that everyone is dirty and therefore don\u2019t ask for much in terms of leadership or governance. We are content with white elephant projects with no real effect on our day to day lives. Now, we have a leader who is searching for ministers whom he believes will be competent and corruption free. Many have mocked him saying that is impossible. It is an insult to decent, well-breed Nigerians. Not everyone is a thief, even if the system does encourage and allow it. Abdulsalami Abubakar and the Peace Committee I AM always surprised and disappointed when those who should not only know better, but should be the first to defend the rights of the poor and downtrodden, are the first to Abdusalami either indulge in, justify or excuse graft. I was indeed surprised that members of the National Peace Committee seemed to intercede on former President Jonathan\u2019s behalf. Although that allegation has been denied, that is what it looked like to Nigerians. We are all only human I suppose: sinners who fall short of sainthood because of our closeness to certain people or often times, our involvement in certain affairs. Forgiveness of sins This is probably why members of the Peace Committee refuse to call a spade a spade. I was particularly surprised by reports quoting Bishop Matthew Kukah as asking President Buhari not to focus on probing the Jonathan administration. This idea of a \u201cwitch-hunt\u201d is truly getting old. Perhaps Christian doctrine does call for the forgiveness of sins, but nowhere in any major religion does it say that wrong-doing is acceptable, particularly when it harms defenseless people, like corruption does. Where does change begin if one is to turn a blind eye to those breaking the law, especially if there is proof both in and outside the country? Moreover, what is to discourage other public officials from taking what is not theirs, from deciding they are more worthy of prosperity than the average Nigerian? Treasury Single Account IF there was ever any doubt that \u201cchange\u201d for the President isn\u2019t just a slogan, even if it might be for some of those around him, his decision to make all ministries, departments and agencies, MDAs, pay all government revenue into a single account is groundbreaking. The murky accounting system our government usually operates, makes it possible for directors, permanent secretaries, ministers and just about anyone, to withdraw funds from various accounts, in a strange process which facilitated corruption. The same people who don\u2019t want a probe of the past administration will find all sorts of interesting reasons why a measure which will bring sanity and transparency back into government finances is a bad thing. With the TSA, everyone can know government\u2019s income and it becomes simple to track and monitor its operations, as well as enable optimal disbursement and utilization of funds. Who would want that despite the Nigerian people? As for the banks complaining government is shutting its accounts with them and limiting liquidity, I hope this will be a lesson for all: we have reveled in mediocrity because it benefitted us in Nigeria, but now the party is over. Government is the private sector\u2019s number one client: this isn\u2019t normal. The banking industry never pushed for a system where it could enable ordinary Nigerians to operate and open accounts doing legitimate business with banks, based on accessible loans and realistic interest rates. It preferred to house ill acquired government money and now that money is no longer available. As Dorothy said in the cult classic \u201cThe Wizard of Oz\u201d, \u201cwe\u2019re not in Kansas anymore\u201d. I hope everyone in Nigeria can adapt to the no-nonsense style of the Buhari era after years of permissiveness. Related",

        "title": "A curious escape",
        "author": "Rotimi Fasan",
        "text": "By Rotimi Fasan THESE are desperate times for the Jonathan Administration and the government might do worse than seeking desperate solutions. Although the streets might be free of protesting Nigerians, the smoke from the bonfires made by them to register their opposition to the careless increase in the pump price of petrol is nowhere near being cleared. Indeed, Abuja has had to resort to a heavy-handed approach to keep things from keeling over. The streets of Lagos are still being kept by soldiers and the State government and the opposition Action Congress of Nigeria are crying themselves hoarse demanding that the soldiers be returned to their barracks. For the first time since he became president, Goodluck Jonathan is baring his fang to show he could bite if he has to. Except that he might have chosen the wrong people to bite now. It\u2019s all part of the desperation that a desperate government has to take to assure itself it is still in control. Perhaps, the government has little choice in the matter given the security situation in the country in which Boko Haram has no doubt made nonsense of our security agencies. The murderous group has been going about its business, daring the government to stop it if it could. Its members are always more than a step ahead of the security agencies, striking with deadly accuracy and without restraint. They practically advertise their agenda and go ahead to carry them out as planned. In spite of police claims to be atop of the security situation, Boko Haram continues to prove that they could do exactly as they please. They kill at random and without any motive beyond inhuman bloodlust. They made the last Christmas a harvest of deaths for many Nigerians especially worshippers at St. Theresa\u2019s Catholic Church in Madalla, Suleija. It was a mindless slaughter on one of the holiest days on the Christian calendar. They\u2019ve since harvested more deaths and are promising more. And in utter helplessness President Jonathan cried out that the group has all but taken over his government. But just when it looked like the drowsy police hierarchy was waking from its slumber and getting close to unravelling the people behind the Madalla massacre, up came the curious escape of their prime suspect, Kabiru Sokoto, pouring cold water over the entire investigation. The escape of Kabiru Sokoto is proof of no other that Boko Haram enjoys the sympathies of people high in the society. Quite frankly such support is not limited to Boko Haram but available to anyone or group ready to lend themselves to any desperate measures. We cannot forget too soon the vow by some to make the country ungovernable for this president after he won the last election despite attempts by those who thought power ought to have remained in the North following the death of President Umar Yar\u2019Adua. They found a leader who failed to assert himself at the very moment he ought to have done so; he allowed some cowards to resuscitate a finished group that is now bent on dragging the country down the slippery slope of an ethnic or religious war, whichever could happen first. The entire secret of the apparent invincibility of Boko Haram is now out in the open. I have said it now and again here that the group has been lionised unnecessarily; attributed powers it does not possess. It\u2019s impossible that a so-called group of illiterate zealots would possess the increasingly sophisticated means that Boko Haram employs without the strong support of influential people. One moment the group is killing in different parts of the North- East and the next it has moved its operational base to Kaduna and then Abuja where it bombed the central establishment of Nigeria\u2019s security, nearly taking out the IG, Hafiz Ringim himself. Sending out messages on the internet and detonating bombs, products of so-called Western education it loathes, like a child who has just found a priced means of diversion, Boko Haram members go about their kind of business under the nose of our security agencies. Surely, the incompetent handling of the investigation that led to the escape of Kabiru Sokoto was contrived. Even reports indicating he might have been arrested, in the first instance, in a facility of the Borno State government are pointers to the link of the suspect and the group he represents to influential members of society. Sokoto\u2019s Houdini-like escape, with handcuffs and all, was a planned work to cover the trail of those sponsoring Boko Haram. Demanding explanation from Hafiz Ringim and suspending Zakari Biu, Police Commissioner in charge of Investigation whose past history and role during the Abacha regime ought to have disqualified him from such responsibility if not the Police Force, may be necessary step. But that is not far enough. Abuja has to dig deep and should follow this trail further. It sure leads to more preys. The calibre of people that have been linked with Boko Haram, politicians and security personnel, says something of how connected some Nigerian leaders are to the group. Even those that have been arrested and pencilled for investigation have all been granted some form of bail or another. It\u2019s only here that terrorists are granted bail and made to visit their homes during a search. My conclusion to last week\u2019s column in which I provided reason for the Jonathan administration\u2019s failure to take on the so-called cabal in the oil sector seems appropriate to end this piece and I quote it here at some length: This government plays too much of the ostrich. What it needs to do is take on the cabal that continues to make nonsense of attempts to make Nigerians enjoy better life. Expose the cabal and let Nigerians see those behind their misery. But we all know things would never come to that level for the very people responsible for the criminal fleecing of Nigeria are the same ones sponsoring candidates into our legislative and executive arms of government. They are the big financiers of presidential and gubernatorial campaigns and donate the largest sums during political events. They dictate who become our security chiefs and heads of our financial sectors. How can a commissioner of police arrest some goon in the pay of the moneybag who sponsored his appointment as the head of police? To cross them is to incur the wrath of the devil himself. And it is in this sense that we must understand the cry by Jonathan which amounts to abdication really that his government is under the control of Boko Haram. Since he can\u2019t fight his tormentors, the president has chosen to turn his fear on Nigerians. But as I once warned here, nobody wins a war against their own people. Related",

        "text": "By Hakeem Baba-Ahmad \u201cPoliticians are people who, when they see light at the end of the tunnel, order more tunnels.\u201d John Quinton. TECHNICALLY, we could claim to be at another starting point in terms of amending the Nigerian Constitution. Our constitution amendment attempts have been like races. There have been many starting points and false starts in the past. A few starts in the past were not concluded, and in many of the races started, you couldn\u2019t tell who were genuine competitors, and who joined the race midway. Distances were not made clear to competitors in the past, and often umpires joined the races. On the whole, we had extremely expensive build-ups to amending the constitution, but they have all yielded very little. There are many reasons for this, and for those who need to understand the reasons why the Nigerian constitution has been notoriously difficult to amend, a cynic\u2019s guide may be useful. i.The exercise involves an isolated few leading an unfortunate multitude. Amending the constitution requires collaboration between the President and the federal and state legislatures. These are supposed to be institutions in which people who are genuinely elected exercise mandates from the electorate, and exercise such mandates only in the interests of the people. To do this, they need to be accessible, accountable and sensitive to the needs of their constituencies. Positions they will adopt will therefore need to be informed by what is best for their constituencies. In Nigeria, however, elected people tend to develop lives of their own, once they receive certificates of return from INEC, or hear the final word from the judiciary on prolonged litigations around their elections. They would have paid huge amounts to their constituents, election and security officials and sundry opinion leaders to secure victories, so they will treat mandates as commodities fully paid for. Most positions they will adopt on amendment are likely to be informed by what it will pay them, either in material terms, or some gratification related to their electoral fortunes. Generally, strong interests behind amendments tend to have very narrow objectives, and in most instances they want to maintain the status quo, or prevent changes which will bestow advantages elsewhere. Nothing of substance, therefore, gets amended, which is fine so long as a huge amount is expended in the process. ii.The dice is always loaded. Constitutional amendments are mostly about tinkering with the manner power is distributed or utilised. No amendment is undertaken purely on its merit, and issues about substance and timing are often informed by very powerful and calculating interests. If you want to amend the number of terms an elected executive can serve, you propose an amendment to that effect along with about 100 other amendments. When you want tenure elongation, you get a committee to identify about 150 areas of the constitution that need amending. If you want no substantial change, you include one or two proposed amendments that will foul up the whole exercise, so every one of the proposals will be thrown out. Self-serving amendments are difficult to push through, so they are placed in the same basket with genuinely-popular issues such as Local/State Government relations. They either float together or sink together. iii.Its mostly about money. Since 1999, every legislature had budgeted huge amounts for constitutional amendments. Countless hearings and expensive junketing have been held. Every type of consultation has been made, such that President Jonathan merely set up a committee under former Chief Justice Belgore to isolate those areas where we still argue over in our constitution. The National Assembly (again) nonetheless set up its own expensive machinery. States will also set up committees to make inputs into the review exercise. Everyone is behaving as if we are starting this business for the first time. So we will waste billions to do everything else except consult the real interests, who are the people. If nothing comes out of the exercise, we will blame no one. It is just the way our democratic system works. iv.Its all about incumbents. The review will be about what people who wield power today want, not about our experiences with the running of the constitution in the past, and not about the future. The President will want a review of the term of elected persons in office, so that they stay longer. Powerful interests in the Southwest want a radical restructuring of the federal structure to give greater fiscal and other forms of autonomy to (possibly bigger) federating units. The southeast wants to have additional states and provisions which enforce the rights of citizens irrespective of their ethno-cultural and geographical locations. The South-south would want to retain or increase its take-home-pay on revenues derived from petroleum and gas. The North will have a basket of demands, most of which will either cancel each other out, or pitch it against itself and the rest of the nation. Governors would want to maintain their stranglehold on Local Governments. Some powerful interests will support state police; others will oppose it. The PDP will have its own shopping list. Legislators will have one eye on the way their Governors want the exercise to go (or not go), and another on their parties. Federal legislators will enjoy a little more autonomy, but will be constrained by pressure from Presidency, their parties and bread-and-butter politics. State legislators will roll over wherever and whenever the Governors want them to. It will not be about improving the electoral process, reducing cost of governance or official impunity, curtailing corruption or empowering the citizenry to hold leaders accountable. v.It is a gimmick While it goes on, the processes for amending the constitution will hold our attention with live transmissions. Most Nigerians who have no T.V sets or power will be shut out. It will divert attention from the scandalous expos\u00e9 around the petroleum and gas sector; the pension scam, or the impending tsunami which Steve Oransaye\u2019s Committee is about to unleash on the nation. It will divert attention from the spectacular failure to deal with Boko Haram, with frightening crime levels in the Southeast, with threats of re-emergence of criminality in the name of militancy in the Niger Delta; and with the unwillingness to deal decisively with endemic failure to organise crisis \u2013 free elections in this country. vi.No penalties for failure. If the constitutional amendment exercise fails to amend anything of value, it will not be anyone\u2019s fault. In a year or two, or during President Jonathan\u2019s (third, second, whatever) term, a new round of attempts to amend the constitution will commence again. We will spend more billions, and if that does not produce any result, no one needs to be blamed. The Nigerian constitution is almost impossible to amend because it works for some powerful interests the way it is. Why should they change it? Related",

        "author": "Josef Omorotionmwan",
        "text": "By Josef Omorotionmwan QUITE often, we lampoon judges, particularly when they deliver judgements that are distasteful to us. These judges come in various forms \u2013 good, bad; corrupt and incorruptible. Still, by Divine arrangement, they come to the rescue in situations that seem helpless. As far back as 1596, William Shakespeare, in one of his profound comedies, The Merchant of Venice, depicted a situation in which the judge came to the rescue of Antonio who guaranteed a loan for his good friend, Bassanio, from Shylock the Jew. Bassanio had technically defaulted on the loan repayment and Shylock insisted on a pound of flesh from nearest Antonio\u2019s heart, which was the condition in the loan agreement. Nothing else, even a promise to refund three times the original loan, was acceptable to Shylock. He wanted a pound of flesh. Portia, who, by today\u2019s standard, would have been a fake judge, came to the rescue. How many people would recognise a fake judge after he has put on those intimidating robes? To many of us, the end justifies the means. And in The Merchant of Venice, the end was more than justified. When all entreaties to Shylock failed, then, came the point of law. \u201cThe law allows it and the court awards it,\u201d that was Portia\u2019s summation. \u201cShylock, you must take your pound of flesh from the breast area, nearest to Antonio\u2019s heart but it must be exactly one pound, no more no less; and not a single drop of Antonio\u2019s blood shall come out in the process!\u201d Shylock was further told. By now, the scale had shifted to the side of Antonio and his friends because a Daniel had come to judgement. Today, the Shylocks are still around and lucky enough, some Portias, some incorruptible judges are also very much around. There are people in high places who would insist on the pound of flesh of the citizenry, provided it meets their own self-seeking interest. Each time our National Assembly members are asked to write a law, they end up invariably writing themselves into the law. All the hue and cry about constitutional amendment or for that matter, amendments to other laws are merely attempts to provide for themselves. Incidentally, though, the iniquities of the legislative chambers cannot always escape the watchful eyes of the judiciary. That was how, like the Shylock in The Merchant of Venice, the PDP-dominated sixth National Assembly sat down and calculated how to oust the jurisdiction of the Elections Petitions Tribunals and the Appeal Courts on election cases. By the time the Appeal Courts restored the stolen mandates in Edo, Ondo, Ekiti and Osun states to their rightful owners, it was clear that the largest (and perhaps most dubious!) political party in Africa was in deep trouble. Their rigging apparatus had gone burst. The National Assembly reached for its bag of tricks and the Electoral Act 2010 came handy. They took Section 140 (2) of the Act to shreds. By the time they were through, candidates whose mandates were blatantly stolen could, of course, seek redress at the Tribunal and Court of Appeal but no matter how hard they tried and even where they were able to convince the court beyond ALL reasonable doubts, the best they could get would be a re-run. This was a big victory for the PDP, knowing too well that its rigging machine was so strong that if re-runs were ordered 10 times, PDP would win 12 times! The few democrats still standing cried hoarse, that rigging had just been legalised. Our President went ahead and signed the obnoxious amendment into law. The PDP celebrated their success in tying the hands of the judges. Even where the opposition already had a bucketful of cold tears back home, the judiciary needed to see a bit of the tears before it could intervene. This was when the Action Congress of Nigeria, ACN, cried to the Federal High Court in Lagos and drew their attention to the fact that by all constitutional standards, the amendment to Section 140 (2) of the Electoral Act 2010 was ultra vires the powers of the National Assembly. Among other things, the amendment was in direct collision with the provisions of Sections 1 (3), 4 (8), 6 (1) (2) (6), 239 (1), 246 and 285 of our 1999 Constitution, as amended. The PDP and its National Assembly pleaded everything, from the absurd to the illogical, including the ludicrous claim that ACN lacked locus standi in the matter. Can you imagine telling a man that he has no locus standi in a matter that is fundamental to his very existence? Wherever there is a Shylock, there must be a Portia. The Portia in this case came in Honourable Justice Okechukwu Okeke, sitting in the Federal High Court in Lagos, who on June 30, 2011, restored the powers of the Tribunal and Appeal Courts to declare an outright winner once the candidate has proved his case beyond doubt. We salute the judiciary. We salute Justice Okechukwu Okeke. Normally, after elections, it becomes the business of the elected to go about seeking the greatest good for the greatest number of the electorate. In the Second Republic where the National Assembly was PDP-dominated (oops, NPN-dominated), the democrats within the NPN fold still voted on the side of civilization on issues of national importance. How could the PDP democrats look the other way when the sixth National Assembly was writing them out of existence? PDP has since lost itself. In the face of anti-people laws, where are the people? Where is democracy? Is this still a party? Lucky enough, there is always an opportunity for a fresh beginning. Related",

        "author": "Rotimi Fasan",
        "text": "By Rotimi Fasan FOR the very first time since his political career assumed national dimension, Goodluck Jonathan is showing he could be a determined person if the need arose. For quite a long while, the President has shown himself as someone ready to capitulate before any determined opposition. He had behaved as someone who would act but only when there is no other alternative. He was suborned, practically, into the position of governor of Bayelsa even when it had become clear that his predecessor could never return to the position he had left in embarrassing circumstances. Jonathan was more than loyal to his former boss or showed himself to be until nobody could accuse him of nursing any ambition. The same scenario played out virtually after Umar Yar\u2019Adua took ill for months, creating a power vacuum, and eventually passed on while some power mongers thought they could impose just about anyone of their choosing on the rest of Nigeria. Jonathan sat back and appeared to be enjoying the dangerous comedy being played out on the national stage even while many Nigerians thought he should have acted to show who was actually in charge. It would take pressure from Nigerians and what seemed like an unprecedented step by the National Assembly before Jonathan could dare do what some other people would have done immediately it became clear that the president could no longer exercise the powers vested in him. And many months since becoming president, Jonathan is yet to demonstrate the decisiveness of some leaders that have ruled Nigeria. Not in the matters of the ethnic and sectarian crises in Jos or the proxy war being levied against the Nigerian State by politicians and other sponsors of terrorist groups like the Boko Haram. No, President Jonathan had always behaved as someone without a mind of his own. Not until question turned to the issue of fuel \u2018subsidy\u2019 removal and the president appear determined to take on Nigerians, if need be, all alone. Even here, though, some Nigerians believe the president is only acting a script prepared for him by others- the power cartel running the oil industry or international organisations like the IMF and World Bank and their spokespersons. If the oil subsidy battle is one imposed on Jonathan by others it is one battle the President is determined to win in his own way despite opposition from even his constituency of politicians in the National Assembly. The town hall debate that pitched proponents and opponents of subsidy against each other might be one of the last in the series of organised campaigns by the Jonathan administration before it plunges Nigeria into the economic quagmire that often follows such removal of subsidy on petroleum products. Now that Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, Diezeani Allison-Madueke and Lamido Sanusi have taken on Femi Falana, Olisa Agbakoba and co with Adams Oshiomole appearing to be sitting on the fence and speaking from both sides of the mouth, Nigerians all might have had their say, leaving Jonathan and his team to have their way. But where that way would lead us to is what nobody could guess beyond saying things won\u2019t be easy at all. Removing the so-called subsidy would be Jonathan\u2019s brutal slap in the face of Nigerians who thought he was a man that would do anything not to be seen to have a mind of his own let alone pushing an unpopular position. But the die seems cast and we can only wait to see what pain this administration\u2019s New Year gift portends. While Nigerians debate fuel subsidy removal or not, North Koreans mourn the passing of their leader, Kim Jong-il in a manner that is as strange as it is unbelievable. There have been unbelievable scenes of ordinary North Koreans weeping ever so loudly, banging their fists, throwing themselves on the floor and appearing very distraught at the death of a man that had ruled them in the last 17 years in what must pass as one of the world\u2019s most authoritarian states. How many are North Koreans and how many of them could have had such intimate and personal relationship with their revered leader as to justify the kind of outpouring of emotion that has followed his death? It might look like Western propaganda when reports pour in of severe repression of a huge population starving under a regime that has nothing to show but for its chest of war arsenal under the control of the fourth largest army in the world. But there is hardly any other way to see Pyongyang that has been under the rulership of the Kims family sinc e the passing of Kim ii-sung in 1994. Now the country faces life under Kim Jong-un, \u2018The Brilliant Comrade\u2019, who succeeded his father to the Kim dynasty that has been imposed on the country. Surely this can\u2019t be democracy? Can North Koreans be so enamoured of the rulership of this family that nobody else would be willing to stand against them? What are indeed the modalities for opposition elements to stand against the Kims in circumstances like these? The succession pattern in Pyongyang is evidence if no other that North Korea is not a free society and that the outpouring of grief since the death of their leader is indeed stage-managed. The kind of personality cult responsible for the situation in North Korea is what led to the Arab Spring and it is what Africa does not need. The boisterous mourning in Pyongyang contrasts with the dignified mourning of Vaclav Havel, man of letters and former leader of the Czech Republic who passed on 18th of this month, a day after Jong-il whose death would only be known to the rest of the world three days after he died. Havel ruled his people for 13 years, ten of which he spent as leader of the Czech Republic between 1993 and 2003. Admired and loved by his people both as an intellectual and a politician, he was one of the leaders of the Velvet Revolution, the non-violent movement that swept through Czechoslovakia in 1989. He was the last leader of a united Czechoslovakia before the split in 1993. Even though a revered leader, Havel faced opposition and would be succeeded by one of his most vociferous opponents, Vaclav Klaus, who leads his country in mourning Havel. Could a person like Klaus have emerged in North Korea or in many parts of Africa including Nigeria? This is a question Nigerians and the noisy mourners in Pyongyang must think about. Do have a great 2012! Related",

        "text": "By Rotimi Fasan OUTSIDE the circle of immediate family members one \u2018guardian angel\u2019 whose intervention was crucial to the birth of this column is the one generally called \u2018Baba\u2019 within the fraternity of Nigerian writers, especially the \u2018younger\u2019 ones. He is a former president of the Association of Nigerian Authors, a poet, politician and lately aspiring governor of Edo State, Odia Ofeimun. Odia, as he is otherwise simply known, as far as I know was the one who suggested my name as the reviewer of Mr. Uwaifo\u2019s book when it became clear somebody other than Reuben Abati would have to review that book. It was through him I would meet Mr. Uwaifo and he played a major role in assuring the author that he had nothing to fear about me being able to fit the bill of reviewer even within the severely limited time left before the public presentation of the book, That Nigeria May Survive. People who believed in him had taken risks on him at a time many would have been content to ignore him. He in turn is ever prepared to take such risks with others in whose ability he believes. His words to Mr. Uwaifo were no mere attempt to allay the author\u2019s fears. But his conviction in my ability to deliver and his confident declaration of this which was in character no doubt went a long way to clear off any niggling doubt. Odia had no time to quibble when it comes to writing. In his typically forthright way, he can be depended upon to give a honest account of his assessment of a writer\u2019s competence. Here, he could be brutally honest, often coming off as too harsh to people either unfamiliar with this trait or used to the more sympathetic mentoring of other older writers. With him the matter is very simple. There are no young or old writers. You either know your art or you don\u2019t. So in the birth of this column Odia was a midwife of sorts. He even took time to read a draft of my review and offered suggestions to improve it. I\u2019ve never forgotten any of this and I knew or hoped there would be space to mention it before the conclusion of this piece even though I was also subconsciously reluctant to say anything that could be considered unduly revelatory about me or others. But Odia probably thought I had forgotten a lot when he sent me his congratulatory message last week on reading the first part of this piece. Of course, I remember all. What I didn\u2019t know was the bit about the publisher who he didn\u2019t name, a fan of sorts, who had read another work of mine, and who also had rooted for me to be the reviewer of Mr. Uwaifo\u2019s book. I have dwelt this long on Odia\u2019s role because sometimes, I believe, his contribution in the development of Nigerian literature and writing in general, by way of mentoring younger writers, is sometimes too quickly glossed over and insufficiently acknowledged. More than any other writer or intellectual teaching/writing anywhere such art is taught in Nigeria, Odia Ofeimun has arguably mentored/trained new writers by the keen interest with which he follows development in that sector. There would be very few Nigerian writers of note below the age of sixty (without mentioning older individuals) who began writing after 1990 that didn\u2019t come under the direct or indirect impact of his mentoring. That is a major contribution to the human capital development of a country, especially one as Nigeria that is increasingly noted for its severe deficit of such credible mentors in any sphere of our cultural, political or intellectual practice. Long before I would even know that I would write for Vanguard, Odia had celebrated my writing in other domains. He has suggested my name as possible replacement to writing events he was invited but couldn\u2019t honour. I believe that is what he does for others. Thus by the time I was to start writing for Vanguard, before Sad Sam\u2019s head-hunting skills came my way, he thinks I was already ripe for the public space. As he put it in his message, \u2018You were already on your way to becoming a public intellectual. You just needed to be collared.\u2019 So in marking the tenth anniversary of this column I gratefully acknowledge his contribution and unstinting fellowship over these many years. A decade since this column made its debut a lot has happened in the wider practice of Nigerian journalism. Much of the developments in this regard are the outgrowth of what might be called the revolution in the spread of social media. This has enabled the involvement and participation of far many more Nigerians in the business of shaping public discourse, thereby democratising Nigerian journalism in particular and media practice in general. Where public discourse is concerned, there are no longer \u2018average Nigerians\u2019. Everyone has an opinion and everyone is an expert of sorts, and people are generally more media-savvy even when there is lot to question about the depth of the \u2018insight\u2019 they proffer or when such insight belong more in the domain of gossip and urban legends masquerading as profound wisdom. But the widespread availability of access to information means that more Nigerians are aware of what goes on in this country and around the world. This in the long run will be salutary for democratic practice. Theoretically people would be less easy to deceive as they are more aware even when such awareness is many times the product of gossips and hearsay. While the media field is more diffuse in terms of sources and practitioners there are certainly more readers today, actual or potential, than at any time predating the advent of social media. Citizen journalism seems the in-thing and while the number of competent writers without mentioning opinion moulders and/or thinkers may not have increased thereby, there are more people with ability to access what passes for news and make their contribution to creating news than before now. The feedbacks from these diverse sources provide important guide into and means for the calibration of the collective mindset. This can prove crucial in shaping the kind of opinion and how such opinion is purveyed by the more professional practitioners who, in spite of the explosion in the population of practitioners, are nevertheless still actively sought and engaged for their reading or measurement of societal tempo. The great challenge of the vast democratisation and massification of the media in the last decade is the remarkable absence of sobriety, the verbal anarchy and intolerance of differing opinions and views by the new entrants into the media space. At this present pace the journey ahead promises to be one hell of a ride. Concluded Related",

        "author": "Rotimi Fasan",
        "text": "By Rotimi Fasan IT was ten years ago this week that the first article appeared in this space. It was 13 May, 2006, I think, that the first article was published. Even though I had known for several weeks now that the anniversary of this column would be this week and I had mentally noted the fact and planned to say a word or two about it, the day seems to have come upon me rather suddenly. It is a testimony to just how harried and occupied one has become in the course of ten years that I had not found the time to check out details of the very first title I wrote here. By the time I wrote my first piece for Vanguard, I had been writing on a fairly regular basis for different Nigerian newspapers and magazines for at least ten years. Indeed, before I took on the invitation to write for Vanguard I had a similar invitation from an editor of The Guardian in Lagos. But I did not follow up on that invitation for reasons I told that editor just a few months ago after he made references about my failure to take up his offer to a friend he was with during an event at the University of Ibadan. By the time I started this column, therefore, I could not be said to be without experience writing in the media. But Vanguard editors still wouldn\u2019t take chances. They didn\u2019t say it but they wanted to be sure, it was obvious, that I could write and indeed do so within a weekly deadline. The invitation to write had come directly from Mr. Sam Amuka Pemu, the publisher. This publisher was not just an entrepreneur. He was a highly respected writer and editor who has been deservedly praised for his uncanny ability to spot talent. It was at an event, the public presentation of a book compilation of the past columns of a former Vanguard columnist, Mr. Solomon Uwaifo that Mr. Amuka had seen me at the MUSON Centre in Lagos. Mr. Uwaifo\u2019s book centred around electric power generation, transmission and distribution. You could describe it as a book about Nigeria\u2019s problem with the provision (or the lack of it) of power. The collected articles were published under the title, That Nigeria May Survive and I had reviewed it. The job of the reviewer was originally meant for Reuben Abati, then editorial board chair of the Guardian, who couldn\u2019t make it on the intended day. Mr. Amuka had sent his invitation to write through Mr. Uwaifo and it would be many weeks before I would meet him at Vanguard Media in Apapa. As a journalist, editor and writer, his reputation preceded him. He it was who had spoken with me and he couldn\u2019t by any chance be said not to know the trade. He thereafter sent for the editor and handed me over to him. But as the authorised gatekeepers on ground, the editors were determined to ensure that quality was not compromised. And so they asked me to hand them enough copies to last for at least four or five weeks. This again, it was obvious, was to ensure they would be able to keep the column running in the event I ran out of ideas or had a writer\u2019s block. Although I obliged them, I sent them updated copy of each of the four or five copies I had handed them initially. Apparently they didn\u2019t see or just failed to use these. For several weeks they went on using what I had originally handed to them and I just had to wait for them to exhaust what they had in their article bank before I started sending them new copies. My deadline then was Friday even though my column appeared on Wednesday, almost one full week after submission. Looking back now that looks like a very long time to send in a copy before it is published. But I ensured that I wrote in a manner that kept the topic of discussion still fresh and without any hint of being almost a week old. Apart from the fact that events are reported at a much faster pace these days, necessitating round-the-clock updating of news, I have since pushed back my deadline to Sunday and sometimes early Monday morning. The demands on one\u2019s time are so many and enormous. But I consider writing this column as important as any other task I have to undertake. Many times I finish writing and send off my copy for the week in the very dead of the night or in the early hours of Monday (it\u2019s nearly 3 in the morning as I write this). Rarely do I write and send off a piece before Saturday now. I take this opportunity to apologise to the editors, especially the sub-editor, for the inconveniences this may cause them even though it has the advantage of ensuring that issues discussed are kept almost oven fresh. Even then, I still find that I sometimes have to send in updated versions of a piece sent earlier. In the ten years since I embarked on this journey, I have yet to record a week in which I didn\u2019t write my piece. Yes, I have hosted about five guest writers, two of whose articles ran for two weeks. There have also been a couple of times when due to some mix-up (in the early years) when sent copies didn\u2019t appear in print. Outside these instances, no week has gone in the last ten years without me writing my column. I have yet to experience the disappointment of waking up to the realisation that I had failed to send in my copy for the week. No matter the inconveniences (and they keep mounting these days), no matter where I happened to be in the last one decade I have made every effort to write my column. It\u2019s not been easy at all writing in circumstances that are not at all friendly. Many times one has to work without electricity (as I do right now), one is often cut off the internet or immediate demands on one\u2019s time simply crowd out any thought that one hasn\u2019t written one\u2019s copy for the week. But in all of this my immediate family has been wonderful. My wife who knows the nature and demands of my daily activities and who has a clear sense of how strenuous it is writing in the circumstances I often have to write, tries to urge me to write my column within the week. When as I often do these days- when I fail to write before weekend and sometimes forget all about it, she is the first and only one who reminds me of it. To be continued next week Related",

Mrs. Salome Oginasisi Iworiso-Markson My sweet, adorable, irreplaceable mother, Sisi \u2013 as she was fondly called \u2013 was a force of nature. And we who had the privilege of being close to her and being moulded by her principles will never cease to miss her laughter and cheerfulness. She could be so charming and kind. I can still hear her voice as she called me \u201cNyen Nyen\u201d, a pet name she coined from my native name, Azibanyenami. But there were times when she became a stern matriarch and had no qualms about cracking the whip. Sometimes, we felt that she went overboard. But, looking back, we completely understand why she never spared the rod. Understanding the logic Someday, when my children are old enough to understand the logic that motivates a good parent, I will tell them what the indefatigable \u201cSisi\u201d told me: \u201cI loved you enough to ask where you were going, with whom and what time you would be back home\u2026I loved you enough to let you assume responsibility for your actions, even when the penalties were so harsh that they broke my heart. But most of all, I loved you enough to say \u201cno\u201d, when I knew you would hate me for it. Those were the most difficult battles of all and I\u2019m glad I won them because, in the end, you\u2019ve won too.\u201d She always insisted on us telling the truth, the whole truth \u2013 with nothing held back \u2013 and nothing but the truth. By the time we were teenagers, she could literally read our minds and seemed to have eyes at the back of her head. Such were her powers of perception. Sisi was that much of a disciplinarian and life to us then seemed tough! We missed out on lots of activities other kids experienced; and for the fear of Sisi, none of us would be caught up in any issues that could bring disgrace to the family name. We were lucky to have Sisi as our mother. She consciously defined our path to a sane life, even amidst the chaos of the city where we grew up. When we finally grew up and left her, we had developed into educated, honest adults with an understanding of why she expressed her love the way she did. Sisi was a petite woman, but hers was a giant legacy; and such was the enduring impact she had on others that today, I am full of gratitude. Sisi, I am rarely one to easily express emotions, but I feel so deeply about memories I shared with you that words are not enough to express them. You were a mother who laboured to see your children excel. You were a other whose greatest fear was to see your children fail. And I\u2019m glad you lived to see the results of your labour and know that you are proud of us all. Mrs Salome Oginasisi Iworiso-Markson, epitomized the best of womanhood; and her cherished virtues and values will live on forever through her children. Though she herself was not highly educated, she possessed a forensic intelligence, made sacrifices to ensure that we were properly educated, encouraged me to study hard and made me realise that education was a ticket to a productive life. I remember the first time she heard my voice on radio when I was a news anchor at Radio Nigeria in Lagos. She was so excited that she raucously called on our neighbours to tune in to the station. And while she admired my zest for writing she often wondered whether I could not write without littering the house with papers. My mother often told us in pidgin language that \u201chard work no dey kill\u201d. Growing up in Ajegunle, my brother and I hawked bread on the streets to augment the family income\u2026while my mother ran a roadside canteen and would wake up at 4am to prepare meals for the construction and council workers who eagerly queued up every morning to buy food from her because she was such a good cook. Mama and my dad shared opposite traits: She was temperamental and he was quiet; and I loved both of them almost equally (next month, it will be 18 years since dad passed away but mama). My mother also taught me integrity, respect for humanity and how to pray. We never missed church service. We worshipped at the Apostolic Church at Boundary in Ajegunle. She believed in the faithfulness of the Almighty, who is able to make all things beautiful even in the toughest of times. We the children are consoled and inspired by her faith in God; and we are committed to following in her footsteps. This tribute will be incomplete if I don\u2019t mention the first time we visited our village in the 1970s. We had been born in Lagos, but our parents wanted to familiarise us with our roots in the area that is now known as Bayelsa. We first drove to Port Harcourt on long and winding roads in my father\u2019s brand new Passat car, then spent a couple of days at a relation\u2019s house. When it was time to proceed to the village, I noticed that my father left the car behind and got us into a bus heading to Yenagoa. Only when we arrived at Yenagoa waterside and got on a big wooden boat that was almost the size of a house did I realize why dad left the car in Port Harcourt. My village in Opume could not be accessed by road back then. And when we arrived, there was no electricity. I remember complaining bitterly about the fact that I couldn\u2019t watch my favourite TV shows because of the lack of electricity. And I remember my mother accusing me of behaving like a spoiled child, then distracting me by teaching me to swim. The situation has now changed. My village is now accessible by road and is just 20 minutes drive from Yenagoa (in the old days, the boat journey took a whole day). I am also glad to announce that Opume \u2013 like most Bayelsa communities \u2013 is now a proud beneficiary of Governor Dickson\u2019s \u201cOperation Light up Bayelsa Project\u201d. God looked around his garden, and found an empty space. He looked down upon this earth, and saw your tired face. He put his arms around you, and lifted you to rest. Adieu. Related",

        "author": "Morenike Taire",
        "text": "By Morenike Taire WHEN Kongi takes on erstwhile occupants of the Nigerian powerhouse, amusement, rather than angst, is elicited. Viewed from whatever angle, the scale is set up not to be balanced. Wole Soyinka will beat any administration we have ever had in a popularity contest, particularly while the latter is in power. In addition, he is a man so accustomed to poetry, that he entertains the audience away from the point being made by government. The people will be tickled by Wole Soyinka\u2019s timeless metaphors. The opposition will over react, and get trapped into trying to match the professor punchline for punchline. They will fail woefully in this regard; the people will be entertained even further and draw their inevitable conclusion. It has happened before, it is happening now! It is such a conclusion that is being drawn in the war of words, if you will, between Nobel Laureate and society watch, Wole Soyinka; and wife of the president, Patience Jonathan: Mrs. Jonathan is a crowd-renting female who would never even be speaking to a man of Soyinka\u2019s status were it not for our warped political systems. It is an unfortunate conclusion, considering that she is not the worst read or even most salacious First Lady we have ever had. But it seems whenever there is trouble between Abuja and the Niger Delta creeks, the name of the First Lady turns up. Patience Jonathan has all the makings of a mother figure. Her figure is full and round and homely and cuddly, the kind of figure a harried man such as Mr. President would be comforted to return home to. Her personal style is indicative of a true African woman, one who is comfortable in the local dress, and uncomfortable with foreign couture. Few people had believed the rumour that the First Lady had gone abroad for a liposuction cosmetic surgery operation, known in local parlance as \u2018tummy tuck\u2019. It just is not her style. Not for Patience the $9,000 Prada purse and Dior lipstick. Save for the pretentious prefix, Dame Patience Jonathan is a woman who is very comfortable, from all indication, in her own skin. Beyond the physical, Dame Jonathan scored big points when she put to shame the entire propaganda paraphernalia of the presidency as she gave thanks to God for bringing her back from the dead after a protracted illness for which she had disappeared abroad for months for treatment. She appeared to Nigerians as a down-to-earth and relatively honest individual. Her misdemeanours of the past were quickly forgiven and forgotten. Slim as it is, the Nigerian feminist community was the first to go up in arms over the appellation given to the first lady. Referring to a woman, unpopular as she is, as a \u201cmere domestic appendage\u201d is as politically incorrect as possible. A small minority of observers not so keen on Kongi\u2019s openly friendly relationship with the ACN leadership in the South west have also criticized him for not beginning his charity from home. A woman of incredible momentum and boisterous ambition, it is unclear what Dame Patience really is about. Her hustle is for power rather than for rights, but therein is the irony: she already has enough of power. Still, there is something that eludes her, something that for her is worth squandering all her newfound goodwill in the search of. Rather than taking on Kongi, whom she referred to unconvincingly as an \u2018embarrassment\u2019, she might for instance have made a statement concerning the statement credited to brawling Rivers lawmaker Evans Bipi, who referred to her as his \u2018mother\u2019, and \u2018Jesus Christ on earth\u2019! Increasing conviction Her PR function could have tagged Bipi an understatement, and distanced the first lady from such an odious character and his activities, particularly the violent ones. This is in the face of increasing conviction from the rest of the country that far from bringing the balance and the sense of justice the country so desperately needs, a South south presidency has brought nothing than trouble. The most recent Rivers debacle- which now has the First Lady at its centre \u2013 is simply a symptom of a simpering disaster and as former Abia governor, Orji Uzor Kalu, has said, \u201cit will end up tearing the entire nation apart, because those involved in the fight are too powerful and connected to be ignored \u2026\u201d Rather than kick at Soyinka\u2019s description of her, she could have consolidated her position as a \u201cdomestic appendage\u201d by paying visits to the flood ravaged residents of her native Bayelsa. Let there be pictures in the papers of her cuddling sick children and on television speaking words of courage to individual victims. This would have stood the president in much better stead than he is currently in with all her frenetic prancing about. Had Rotimi Amaechi been impeached by the intrigues of the anti-Amaechi segment of the Rivers Assembly, Dame Patience would have gone down in history as the first First Lady to bring down a governor in the Nigerian nation. Not bad for a lady of such attestable humble beginnings. Amaechi has done well to set up a committee to look into the issue of July 9 and 10. By the end of the three months during which the nine-man committee will come up with its long winding report, perhaps tempers would have cooled somewhat. Perhaps our famous national amnesia would have kicked in, and we would have forgotten all the fine points which we find so offensive now. Even more money would have been squandered and hopefully, Rotimi Amaechi would still be the governor of the oil-rich State. Related",

        "title": "A fair trade",
        "author": "Debbie Olujobi",
        "text": "By Debbie Olujobi The concept of fair trade is a direct response to business practises that exploited the most disadvantaged people of the world while making the rich even richer. It was a more sophisticated version of the slave trade and it involved keeping people in sustained poverty while using them for cheap labour. The sweat of children, women and others fuelled the capitalism and the extravagance of the first world. A legion of workers would be kept in the most appalling conditions and paid little or next to nothing for labour which was skilled and dedicated. They were worked to the bone and not given the benefits that were the due of their counterparts in other more developed areas of the world. I had heard of sweat shops (factories where children, women and even men were kept often by force to produce cheap goods) but I can\u2019t say I was altogether sympathetic to the cause of the individuals. Most people don\u2019t realise the heartache and sorrow that goes into the production of the goods that we consume without a second thought and the film \u201cBlood Diamonds\u201d op ened our eyes to the real cost of \u201cBling\u201d. When talking about modern day slavery, most people are appalled that such a thing can still exist in this day and age. We recount visions of slaves in shackles travelling to the new world while chained down like animals and the thought of that is abhorrent even to the most hardened of hearts. In my view slavery is the subjugation of a person or persons to coerce them into an act or labour not of their own choosing. If that definition is acceptable to all then slavery exists in almost every Nigerian home today. Child labour cannot be described as anything other than slavery as a child cannot legally make a decision to work for anyone without some form of coercion. A majority of our households employ children under the age of consent to work as house helps. In exchange their parents are paid a pittance through a middle man who makes a tidy sum on supply the children to the homes in the cities. I came across such a transaction recently and met a seedy looking man negotiating transport fees to bring a 12 year old from a village outside Lagos. From what I gathered he was the procurer of young children for domestic labour for which he was paid a commission and transport fees. I wondered how he managed to convince the parents of such very young children to part with them and send them to far away towns and homes. In Africa it is common place to have children work for more affluent families and it never used to be considered work. The children just helped with housework and in exchange were fed, clothed and educated by the host families. They were more often than not treated the same as all other children and for all intents and purposes a part and parcel of the family. At no time could that have been taken to be slavery as the families knew one another; there were no middlemen. The children were not seen as tools of a commercial enterprise. These days the children are the modern day slaves as they are subjected to inhuman treatment and used as tools of barter by the middlemen who often trade on them to extort money from multiple customers. Watching a documentary on CNN describe children used for labour on the cocoa farms, I remembered that middleman I had seen. He was no different than the ones who supplied the children that were being used to feed the chocolate needs of the world in Ivory Coast. I do not employ anyone under 18 to work for me domestically as I have never felt right about children waiting on children or children caring for other children. I do know that men tend to disconnect from domestic affairs and not get involved in hiring of domestic staff but I believe it may be time to wake up the collective consciences of the entire family. The reason most homes prefer to employ young children is security; the older more experienced adults tend to steal and most families have experienced severe losses. In recent times some families have had their children kidnapped by these young adults and had to pay huge amounts to get them back. The bottom line is that we all need help on the domestic front; my counsel is that we should embrace the c oncept of fair trade. It is certain that most people will disagree with my position that their house helps are more of slaves than anything and I would simply ask them to follow the rules that govern fair trade and see whose position is right. 1. What is the time line of the work that your helps render? Do they close for the day at 6pm or 7pm or are they expected to serve you from when they wake till you sleep? 2. Is their accommodation such that their personal space is respected and safe guarded or do you make room for them on the floors that become available when your family is asleep? 3. Are their working conditions such that protect them and their future? In other words are they being paid enough for the service they render with such bonuses as healthcare and even a prospect of vocational training or further education? 4. Do you periodically subject them to mental and physical abuse as a means to control them? (That\u2019s actually against the law). The jury is out on whether we are all guilty of modern day slavery but our consciences should hopefully be pricked into fairness. It\u2019s worthy of note to remember that the sun shines on the son of the rich and the poor without discrimination: we are all the same before God. Related",

        "author": "Rotimi Fasan",
        "text": "By Rotimi Fasan PRESIDENT Umaru Yar'Adua has kept his word to spell out the details of the amnesty promised militants of the Niger Delta who renounce violence for a peaceful resolution of the crisis in the region. The militants have come under increasing fire from the Joint Task Force of the military that had been locked in a supremacy battle with them in the last couple of years. The battle promised to go on for long, swinging between occasional victory and loss for both sides. It didn't look as if the military could overcome the militants to say nothing of ending the battle with them on the battlefield. Or so many thought, until the latest onslaught that has brought misery to many who cannot by any stretch of the imagination be described as militants. Matters came to this sorry pass after about a dozen military men, soldiers and officers, were ambushed and killed by persons believed to be militants. The uniform of one of the officers would be found in a shrine, to be followed by the discovery of a mass grave in which the soldiers were said to have been buried. That episode was a rude slap on the face of the military which, with the approval of Abuja, decided to take the battle to suspected strongholds of militancy in the Niger Delta. The military was able to re-establish its authority in the Delta, proving to a considerable extent that it is the undisputed custodian of violence in the country. The indiscriminate and perhaps disproportionate response of the JTF to the loss of its men would lead to calls for a truce. It was in response to these calls that the President made the unilateral offer of amnesty to the militants provided they were ready to give up their arms. Details of the promised amnesty had to be spelt out after Ateke Tom, one of the militants' leaders, took government up on it, questioning the nebulous nature of the promised amnesty. In direct response to Tom, the Presidency promised to respond within a week and that promise was fulfilled on June 25. With this it would appear that the government is ready to play ball with the militants. There had been questions as to the sincerity of government and these questions were not without justification. The first time such an amnesty was promised militants was under the Obasanjo administration when Asari Dokubo's name was synonymous with Niger Delta militancy. The militant leader would accuse Obasanjo of playing a fast one on him, reneging on his promise after he, Dokubo, gave up his arms. Not many Nigerians would disagree with Dokubo's claim, knowing Obasanjo for the kind of wily fox he was. Dokubo has been, more or less, tamed so that the recent spat between him and the intelligence department during which he was detained (?) might be a baiting trick to see if there is any fire left in him. Can the \"old lion\"\u009d still roar, the sleuths would seem to be asking? Which, to go back to the point I was making, is to say that there were grounds for the militants to doubt government's sincerity. That doubt couldn't have been completely eliminated and it would be unfair to deny a person a tool that has stood him in good stead in times of great need. But then it would also not be fair to judge a man by the conduct of another. This is to say that it would be playing fair for the genuine militants, not the mere treasure hunters among them, to give Yar'Adua a benefit of the doubt now he has tossed the ball back into their court by responding to their demands for clarification concerning the amnesty. Above all-\u00c2 being fair or not to Yar'Adua who is nowhere close to the Niger Delta, there is the imperative of ending the misery of the longsuffering people of the Niger Delta, neither militants nor government agents who have been fishing, literally, in the troubled waters of the region. This more than anyone else deserves their peace and nothing should be done to further deny them this irreducible minimum of civilised humanity. While the military might feel a sense of self-righteous justification in the manner it has taken on the militants, it must, rather than pushing this too far, recognise that not only is the Niger Delta a very critical part of Nigeria and its inhabitants brothers and sisters of other Nigerians, the very asymmetrical nature of the \"war\"\u009d in the Delta would ensure that the military fail to achieve full victory. Watch this space! It does not require the entire Niger Delta to give Nigeria the image of an unstable polity with all the disadvantages that come with that. All that is needed is a few determined groups. But now we have another opportunity for peace let everybody remember what is at stake and seize it. Related",

        "text": "By Ogaga Ifowodo The ugly spectacle of the \u201cstreet fight\u201d that broke out in the Rivers State House of Assembly on July 9 gives further and better particulars of our determination to forever make nonsense of representative governance and a fool of ourselves. In the even more shaming light of attempts at justification by a protagonist of the latest episode in our unending political theatre of the absurd, I restate my view that perhaps our political predicament lies in the insistence on practising democracy without democrats. And in far too many instances, with near-illiterates, which is worse \u2014 if comparatives make any sense at this point. \u201cHonourable\u201d Evans Bipi, one of the chief brawlers in the aforementioned incident, is currently the butt of jokes for confessing that he was provoked into violence when a colleague blasphemed Jesus Christ in the person of Mrs Patience Jonathan. Hon Evan Bapakaye at loggerheads with a Mobile Police Officer at the Rivers State House of Assembly during the crisis that rocked the House. Photo: Nwankpa Chijioke I am unable to say whether this is a tragic or a comic statement, but I see the laughable in it: unbeknownst to us and the world, a female Christ \u2014 and a black one at that! \u2014 not only chose Nigeria for her unheralded and closely guarded abode on earth, but also chose to reveal herself to one man alone, allegedly her cousin and die-hard loyalist. After which, she swore him, at pain of hell, to secrecy. Until not even the never-quenching fires of hell could make him keep the secret. Such is the maddening power of an insult! In the vortex of his rage, Bipi blurted out to those who tried to restrain him, thus: \u201cWhy must he be insulting my mother, my Jesus Christ on earth? . . . I can\u2019t take it!\u201d The \u201che\u201d is \u201cHonourable\u201d Chidi Lloyd, majority leader of the house. It is not known what insufferably blasphemous words Lloyd spoke. And, yes, I say that our greater tragedy, to attempt putting a metaphorical gloss on the point, may well be seeking to make democratic bricks without straw. On that Bloody Tuesday in Port Harcourt, the legislators had reconvened to discuss an amendment to the state\u2019s 2013 budget. The house had been forced to adjourn indefinitely due to the fact that the legislators were deadlocked in opposing camps created by the series of events surrounding Governor Rotimi Amaechi\u2019s widely publicised difficulties with his Peoples Democratic Party and President Goodluck Jonathan. In the ensuing melee, some legislators were injured and property was destroyed. Curiously, the police, who had been invited by the speaker to keep the peace at this expectedly contentious sitting, and who had cordoned off the assembly premises, were content to look on. It was not until Governor Amaechi arrived with a detachment of Government House security men that some order was restored. Upon his departure, a gang of five led by Bipi, sitting without their fifth member who was by now being treated in a hospital, impeached the \u201cpro-Amaechi\u201d speaker, \u201cHonourable\u201d Otelemabala Amachree, and installed the \u201cpro-Jonathan\u201d Bipi in his place. Democracy without democrats: first, Mr Bipi not only indulges in contemptible idolatory with his confession of Mrs Jonathan as his Jesus Christ \u2014 his lord and personal saviour, as it were \u2014 but also goes on to top that with a poor orphan cry. Second, the purported impeachment. By all independent accounts, it was done by four out of 32 members. The audacity of it, and the effrontery of seeking to claim any validity for the action even after passions should have cooled, is shocking beyond belief. It does not come close to the pathos of the action to point to such obdurate impunity as just another instance of democracy without democrats. Something infernal, I think, has taken complete control of the minds of a fearfully large number of our politicians. What this event proves is that our democracy, far from maturing the farther we go from the horrors of military tyranny, has, on the contrary, become in essence more infantile and crude. Majority of our politicians lack the necessary acumen, discipline and comportment \u2014 in a word, character \u2014 to be standard-bearers of democracy. Thirdly, it is as a consequence of an insufficient appreciation of the finer principles of democracy and federalism that the House of Representatives moved, hastily, to take over the duties of the Rivers Assembly under Section 11(4) of the Constitution when nothing short of an emergency, as envisaged by Section 305 of the said Constitution, would justify such an extraordinary step. While the event of July 9 is utterly shameful, there is no indication that the \u201csituation prevailing\u201d in the state was close to the sort of breakdown of law and order contemplated by the Constitution. Lastly, the warts of our federalism were further displayed by the attitude of the state\u2019s Commissioner of Police, Joseph Mbu. The incongruity of a governor, supposedly the chief security officer of his state, being saddled with a commissioner of police answerable to a federal authority makes mockery of the concept of federalism. And a faulty federalism can only produce a strange democracy. Or, \u201cdividends of democracy\u201d turned fearful miracles. Related",

        "author": "Bisi Lawrence",
        "text": "By Bisi Lawrence There are times when I start saying something about Dr. Goodluck Jonathan and stop mid-sentence. It would suddenly occur to me that, no matter what, he is still the President of the country in which resides the most populous conglomeration of black people on this planet. At such times, I remind myself that he therefore occupies a position of respect, even if I disagree with the way he occupies it some of the time. He still occupies it. The truth is that I had always taken a dim view of his occupation of it, in the first place. That was not because I thought he was unfit to be president. In fact, on the face of it, he had all the requisite qualifications as specified in the Constitution and more. Rather, I thought the time was unsuitable, and that his success depended on too many factors over which he might not have enough control. I even stated these misgivings on this page. Chief of these was the effect it would have on the fabric of the nation\u2019s unity, since it was clear that election into office would be resented fiercely by those who adhered to the zoning principle of his party, the Peoples Democratic Party. I was certain the PDP would have to struggle to ever be the same again if he ran for the office and won. Well, he ran and he won. Someone who has a big say in the security development of the nation has publicly characterized some of the violent unrest in the country as an aftermath of that election. When Andrew Owoeye Azazi, the National Security Adviser, made that chilling pronouncement about the rise of violence as almost a sequence to the stance of some PDP, and other elements of a Northern stripe, on the election of Goodluck, some people thought he had gone too far and should be relieved of his post; others felt he would anyway be removed by some entrenched powers. He is still there. What many people did not seem to immediately grasp was that he hardly would have made that well-prepared presentation without the knowledge and consent of his principle. But that is really not the point here. The import of his statement was that it confirmed what was so predictable, but was being apparently denied and glossed over. The upshot is that this country has seldom been as divided as it now stands, even during the Civil War. Make that one of the pains of the first Jonathan year. There are other pains, some of them gratuitously self-inflicted. They hinge mostly on statements that are laden with controversy. The elongation of the presidential tenure was one. Some people are still at a loss about what provoked the speculation, or recommendation, of a one-term elongated term for the president \u2013 and that from a president who had hardly been in office enough to even warm his seat at that time. We asked then about what necessitated the hurry to push such an agenda on to the front burner ahead, and in spite, of so many important questions crying for answers in the country. That subject is yet a source of anguish within the body politic. The removal of the so-called petrol subsidy was a source of palpable distress to a host of individuals, but it has been slammed down on the nation in the face of a country-wide resentment expressed by demonstrations of an almost unprecedented magnitude. Before the tension subsided, it almost became a confrontation of the people with armed policemen and elements of the militia. Many of us were praying that it would not attain the scale at which weapons would be used against civilians, the way we saw them used in places like Egypt and Libya. The embers of the resentment are still smouldering, but Jonathan would not let them expire peacefully. The President is said to be considering the total removal of a subsidy, the existence of which has been dipped neck-deep in disbelief by the subsequent enquiry which highlighted the mismanagement and misappropriation of the assets that would have filled the gap it might have created. Many of us are going to resume praying. And what about the Sovereign Fund? State Governors are at daggers drawn with the President, all the way to the law courts. This has degenerated to the scenario of a farce, right before our eyes. And now in the final analysis, we have to appreciate that it is no longer a case of who is right, but what is right. A disagreement between administrations of government at different levels should never, ever be allowed to deteriorate to the point at which the Federal Attorney-General and State Attorney-Generals could wag their wigs at one another over such an issue. It is a slap on the face of decent administration; it demeans the dignity of governance; and it erodes the regard which the people should have for authority. In plain terms, it is simply disgraceful. The citizens of this country have had to bear a lot of agony this past year. Let us shelve the myriads of problems besetting the nation today. The President, of course, would go defensive these days when they are mentioned, and attempt to disown any responsibility for them on the grounds that they existed before he came into office. Precisely. However, that was why he was voted into office. He accepted them as his own when he made those alluring promises about how he would tackle them, and we believed him. The people are beginning to hesitate, or are downright unwilling, to believe him any more. Some would even believe Henry Okah in preference to the stylized accounts of Aso Rock. And many of them are from his own Niger Delta area. Many Nigerians were led, for instance, to expect a change in the composition of the cabinet by a series of undisputed reports, all the way to the wire. And then a bland denial surfaced as to how there was never any idea to reshuffle the cabinet. But the people are not impressed. That is why there are slings of disillusionment, disapproval and displeasure aimed at Aso Rock from so many directions now at the end of his first\u2014or second?\u2014term of office. (The President, by himself through his penchant for rousing unnecessary controversy, has created a debate even over his tenure already, three years before any election is due.) Someone opined that President Goodluck Jonathan has achieved nothing in his first full year in office. If the pains on the psyche of the populace count for nothing, he may be right. Time out Echoes: The incandescent luminosity of Nigeria has been brought to an irreducible minimum in terms of development, because the laodicean disposition of President Jonathan has led to a groundswell of exploitative oligarchs, horrendous corruption, total insecurity, eerie fiscal policies, no roads, no houses, no light, no food, no Medicare, no peace, etc. It\u2019s one year of stupendous skulduggery and unthinkable schmaltzy. He has no moral authority to contest the 2015 election. The vast majority of our Governors should also follow suit. We admonish Nigerians to be politically sagacious in 2015 \u2026 (Chief Bobson Gbinije. Mandate Against Poverty (MAP) WARRI \u2013 080582316690) \u2026 Chief Bobson always says these things the way they are, doesn\u2019t he? And you can understand what he\u2019s saying with a little help from a mighty dictionary! Well, it would appear that the problems that people are facing are indeed so many that they won\u2019t be \u201cshelved\u201d anyway. Echoes: Re-\u201dMonkeys and baboons, the spoken statement form Buhari is not in anyway inciting, nor does it connote violence. \u201cKare Jini, Biri Jini\u201d in Hausa is nothing more than a \u201cClash of Titans\u201d (In other words), when a dog and a monkey are fighting, it is not easy to predict the winner.

        "author": "Les Leba",
        "text": "By Les Leba The other day, a friend narrated a story, which I found stranger than fiction; the story related to the travails of a family who lost a successful and illustrious breadwinner, who, incidentally, died without a Will. The family\u2019s elders were consequently entrusted with the responsibility of efficiently managing the estate of the deceased. In spite of the huge credit balances, lucrative estates and other profitable income generating businesses, the Elders\u2019 Council thought it wise to consolidate the incomes from these investments as savings for future generations! Consequently, rather than spend from the robust income streams available, the Elders\u2019 Council, in their wisdom, gleefully funded their expenditure by borrowing at over 15% interest rate from their bankers, while their savings earned paltry yields, often below 5%. Predictably, the oppressive interest charges rapidly gulped up the erstwhile flourishing income streams until the mortgaged estates were systematically acquired by the banks as repayment for mounting debts. Within a few years, the once prosperous business became bankrupt and the family was reduced to penury. I wondered aloud to my friend, whether this story related to a family made up of stark illiterates, but I was surprised when he confirmed that the Elders\u2019 Council comprised a team of reputed professionals, who were educated in some of the best universities in the world! When my friend took his leave, I quietly wondered if the story I had heard could ever be true; however, later that evening, it occurred to me that as outrageous as it may seem, in reality, the story of this tragic family appears congruent with the story of our country, Nigeria! Nigeria is, undoubtedly, abundantly blessed with resources; for example, crude oil revenue alone often exceeds projected annual spending. Curiously, managers of our economy annually deliberately understate projected revenue with very conservative benchmarks for crude oil price and output. Government subsequently proceeds to finance the anticipated ghost deficits by borrowing at oppressive rates often above 15%, while simultaneously consolidating revenue \u2018surpluses\u2019 as savings deposits with yields well below 5%, particularly for dollar or euro denominated deposits! It appears to be of no consequence that the same banks that receive our incomes and deposits for little or no yield are predominantly the same sources, which fund our government\u2019s borrowings. Pray, why borrow back your own money at excruciating costs? These banks, which currently post hundreds of billions of naira profits, are the same banks, who were also beneficiaries of over N5tn government funding in the last three years, according to recent reports from AMCON; meanwhile, revitalization of the real sector has remained just a promise! Despite the huge borrowings to fund budget ghost deficits, the \u2018surplus\u2019 income is regularly hounded into a so-called Excess Crude Account or alternatively consolidated in a savings account designated as a Sovereign Wealth Fund; the yield from either account is probably below 3%. Incidentally, the constitution does not recognise either of these accounts, which are definitely discordant in a truly federal constitution. Instructively, the funds consolidated in both accounts may ultimately become inadequate for the liquidation of the rising debts, which were unnecessary in the first place, as we generated adequate income to have forestalled these humongous government borrowings! So, as it is with the misguided recklessness of the Elders\u2019 Council in our earlier story, so it is with the management of the Nigerian economy. In spite of our fortuitous resource endowments generating more income than projected in our annual budgets, government remains committed to a strategy of borrowing at excruciating rates of interest to fund budget ghost deficits, which are deliberately instigated by understating projected revenues annually. It is no wonder, therefore, that despite these increasing \u2018surplus\u2019 savings, there is deepening poverty and very little on the ground, nationwide, to show for our bourgeoning debt profile. Meanwhile, the managers of our economy would grab every available opportunity to extol the wisdom of a fiscal strategy, which will take us nowhere! Nevertheless fortunately, all is not lost, as the National Assembly constitutes a superior authority over the powers of the economic team. Indeed, in May 2008, in an article titled \u201cNational Assembly Fiddles as Debt Burden Cripples\u201d, this writer warned the National Assembly to arrest the rapidly increasing debt accumulation by the Debt Management Office and the Central Bank; regrettably, the National Assembly remained reticent. However, now that the cancerous impact of reckless debt accumulation has become very glaring, the current legislature would have failed our nation woefully if they do not immediately stop all government borrowings. It is necessary that we first determine the reason for accumulating an oppressive debt burden, which would be avoidable if current income streams are used to fund ghost deficits instigated by deliberate understatement of annual projected revenues.

        "author": "Donu Kogbara",
        "text": "By Donu Kogbara I RECENTLY heard a rumour that triggered off a thought that made me smile. And I reckon that anything that makes me smile at a time when Nigerians are staggering under the weight of myriad problems \u2013 economic woes, prolonged power outages, marauding Fulani herdsmen, mass abductions of vulnerable schoolgirls, etc \u2013 may be worth sharing with Vanguard readers (many of whom have contacted me in the past few months to tell me that they are depressed). The gossip that has reached my ears is that President Muhammadu Buhari will not seek re-election next year and intends to ask his party, the APC, to make his kinsman, Hadi Sirika, the Minister of State for Aviation, its presidential candidate. This rumour may be totally false; but I can\u2019t resist the temptation to at least try to lighten up the sombre atmosphere in our grim pressure cooker of a nation by making a frivolous observation that may cheer some of you up: Sirika, a former pilot, is so handsome and debonair that if he runs, he will probably have an electrifying Pied Piper effect on Nigerian womanhood and capture 95 per cent of the female votes!\u2026unless Donald Duke, the equally dashing and decorative ex-Governor of Cross River State, also throws his hat in the ring! #He Too! THE \u201c#MeToo\u201d movement took off worldwide on social media platforms last year in the wake of the public shaming of Harvey Weinstein, the now notorious Hollywood movie mogul who has been accused of exploiting his powerful position by sexually assaulting or harassing several women, including now-famous actresses who needed his patronage when they were starting out. Weinstein was disgraced and financially ruined by these allegations (over 50 so far and counting); and the fact that a man as important as he could be dragged off his pedestal gave millions of silent-until-then female victims in other settings the confidence to finally complain about traumatic experiences. Many different types of women doing many different types of jobs in many different countries have rushed to point out online via Twitter that They Too have been subjected to violence or unwanted amorous advances at work. Having myself suffered at the hands of influential predatory males who think that they are entitled to not only hit on any woman who takes their fancy (even when it is blindingly obvious that the woman is not interested) but to punish you if you dare to say \u201cno\u201d, I do not wish to undermine the \u201c#Me Too\u201d movement. It is not funny to be cornered by a lecherous Oga you didn\u2019t encourage \u2013 and to then be coldly deprived of opportunities simply because you had the temerity to politely turn him down. And it\u2019s great that the voices of often ordinary women who have hitherto been too afraid to talk about such bullying (and about being actually raped in extreme cases) are now being heard loud and clear. However, at a time when bad men are being quite rightly demonised, we need to remember that there are also quite a few good guys on the planet \u2013 as in perfect gents who never make females around them feel uncomfortable and have helped me and many other women without demanding anything in return. And, by the way, let us also admit that some young girls and older women are also very calculating and predatory!\u2026and will go out of their way to seduce potentially useful men, most of whom happen to be married. A Vanguard reader recently wrote to me, to somewhat sourly express the view that Nigeria is full of rapaciously ambitious females who \u201cjoyfully sponsor thanksgiving prayers in church or mosque when they meet sex pests.\u201d And it\u2019s certainly true that some women are ruthless temptresses who relish the advantages they gain from such transactional relationships, don\u2019t even try to rely on their (frequently scanty) talents and qualifications when they\u2019re seeking professional promotions or business benefits and aggressively target essentially decent men, who usually feebly succumb (and sometimes regret it). With this reality in mind, I am beginning to think that there should also be a \u201c#HE Too\u201d movement, comprising men who have been lured by ladies who lust! Leave them alone! AUSTYN Ogannah, the President of the Online Publishers Association of Nigeria, OPAN, just sent me a press release expressing concern over claims by the Police that two OPAN members \u2013 Timothy and Daniel Elombah \u2013 committed terrorism offences and cybercrimes because they approved an opinion article on their website that the police regard as uncomplimentary. The Publishers of Elombah News have been accused of cyber stalking Ibrahim Kpotum Idris, the Inspector-General of Police, IGP and \u201cchampioning Biafra terrorism\u201d. OPAN has demanded the withdrawal of these \u201cspurious\u2026and ridiculous\u2026charges without delay\u201d and the cessation of harassment of reputable journalists \u201cfor doing their constitutionally-backed assignments\u2026and carrying out their social responsibility. \u201c The press release then \u2013 UNDERSTANDABLY! \u2013 points out that it is \u201claughable that the police force under whose watch 110 female teenage students were kidnapped from their dormitory at the Government Girls Technical Science College, Dapchi, Yobe State, can shamelessly descend so low to the extent of filing fabricated charges against the two journalists\u2026\u201d This kind of Naija drama really irritates me because it is SO Third World. I don\u2019t know why the IGP is wasting his precious time and limited resources on picking unnecessary fights with media personnel. He should leave the Elombah brothers alone and focus, with immediate effect, on more pressing law-and-order issues like the kidnapping epidemic that is terrifying Nigerian citizens and making us look terrible internationally!

        "author": "Adisa Adeleye",
        "text": "By Adisa Adeleye THE other funny Saturday when I witnessed an election that never was, saw a funny side of me. In utter desperation to conquer my anger over the days\u2018 incidence, I threw myself carelessly on my bed with windows open, not minding any intruders. There were intruders\u2013 the tiny mosquitoes which feasted lavishly, after giving adequate warning by their incessant humming. It would appear funny that I did not take adequate prevention in a mosquito_ infected area. The consequence of Malaria and its debilating effects on the body is a sad reminder of the obstinacy of a nation that refuses to take adequate measures to prevent the deadly disease. In a more tolerable environment, mosquitoes eat grass in our local enviroment, mosquitoes feed joyfully on human blood (with adequate notice). In many enlightened comments before the drama of April Fool(pardon April 2), it was clearly pointed out that one of the most effective weapons of electoral malpractices has been either disappearance of voting materials or vanishing (like ghosts) of electoral officials or both. In many cases, voters\u2018 cards would be faulty or insufficient especially in known opposition areas. All other forms of rigging of elections were happily discussed in this column some weeks ago to put Prof Attahiru Jega and his team on the alert. It must be admitted however, that Prof Jega as an individual (no matter how clever) could not do the job alone. He is expected to have capable assistants. If he had asked for billions of badly battered naira, and he was obliged, then, there should be no reasonable excuse for a terrible but false start. The lesson of last Saturday is that the leaders are isolated from public education by some clever people who have their own interests to pursue. If leaders have no time to read all newspapers, some officials should be identified to inform them on relevant topics. It is necessary for the education of Prof Jega and his team, to restate some of the actions by politicians that might affect the credibility or fairness of the coming elections. These are late arrival of electoral officials, late arrival of voting materials, badly printed ballot papers, wrong information on ballot papers and extra thumbing of remaining ballot papers after voting has ended. The arrest of candidates (on fictitious petitions) before election (prevalent in 1950s and 1960s) is now rearing its ugly and the Police should exercise discretion. If there are correct results at all voting booths, the central collation of total votes would be easier. However based on past experience in some areas, many nasty things could have happened on the road between the various booths and the central collation centre. Indeed some ugly things had happened in the country since 1960 that might have put our reputation (solid and hopeful) in danger. One thing is certain \u2013 there is serious disconnect between leadership and the people. There had been no direct line of communication between the rulers and the ruled. There had been and still ample room for intermediate officials to exert their pernicious influence or play \u2018dirty politics\u2018 in the execution of their official duties. In the great anticipation of a free and fair election in 2011, many Nigerians are not focusing on political and economic issues that would shape post_election era. Not many people had considered constructively the implication of ceaseless violence in Jos or untamed violence of Boko Haram in Maiduguri on the unity and security of the country. The problems after the elections might be greater than the present ones that are being viewed with unpardonable levity. Some leaders are playing dirty politics in their own selfish interests. A more disturbing aspect of the country\u2018s economic policy (or lack of it) is the widely acclaimed policy of wealth with full employment and the regressive policy embarked upon by the Central Bank. Since the emergence of Keysian economics following the economic depression of the 1930s, Western nations have adopted the policy of full employment (not more than 3 per cent unemployment) to promote economic growth. On economic growth, Keynes noted that in times of\u2018depression and unemployment\u2018 it is desirable to encourage spending lavishly. The right action is to let as more money as possible fructify in the pockets of the citizens rather than to fritter it away on government activities nor absolutely necessary! Keynes pattern of expenditure as related to our situation would be household expenditure to stimulate dormant demand for locally produced goods and government expenditure for infrastructural development (not recurrent personal emoluments). The available strategy all over the world is through budget surplus, which is an anathema to our Central Bank Governors (past and present). The present Central Bank Governor has altered the Monetary Policy Rate (MPR) thrice since assuming office on the pretence of preventing anticipated inflation. The recent increase to 7.5 per cent is to prevent inflation that might arise from a budget deficit (from a budget 2011 yet to be implemented) and expected spending by politicians. The latest increase was taken under an atmosphere of stable economic condition, rising oil revenue and reducing inflationary rate. Inspite of CBN\u2018s ad_hoc rescue plan for Power, Agriculture and Manufacturing, its constant tightening policy (high interest rates and mopping up of excess liquidity (which is self created) would tend to retard real economic growth if it is followed by what is called (fiscal retrenchment). Certainly, an economic policy of \u2018Go, Follow me, Stop being presently pursued by the Central Bank, and recommended to the Federal Government to pursue in its fiscal stance would not promote employment but unemployment and stunted economic growth. Is Mallam (now Dr.) Lamido Sanusi, son of an ex diplomat and a former Emir of Kano playing \u2018dirty politics\u2018 with the country\u2018s monetary policy? Time will tell.

        "author": "Gambo Dori",
        "text": "police By Gambo Dori IN the last many years, we have all been buffeted by the bad and unwholesome news about us. The air waves, the pages of newspapers and the dark alleys of the social media are all replete with the famed sharp practices of the average Nigerian. Probably because the story of the sharp Nigerian has been repeated over and over, we have all been in danger of being painted in those murky colours. This sordid image affects us collectively as it is reflected on how foreigners view us. When we seek for visas to get into their countries we experience difficulties. And when we want foreigners to come and invest in this country we experience reluctance due to the bad news that spread about the average Nigerian. However, there has been a gale of good, bright, news in the last one week about heroic activities of Nigerians in different spheres of life that is putting us all in a new light and infusing a new confidence in the nation. The first of the good news arrived in my WhatsApp site and surprisingly it is about the police, an institution whose name has been dragged in the mud a lot. To back up the story, the account came complete with pictures of the policemen doing this yeoman\u2019s job. It is one story that you don\u2019t hear about the police nowadays and I felt uplifted when I read it, and decided to share it with you: \u201cI was driving on Third Mainland bridge and had a flat tyre just before the Yaba turning. As I pulled off the road to change the tyre, a police man approached me asking what the problem was. Before long he had called his colleagues and they were helping me change my car tyre. I must confess, I was a bit uncomfortable seeing the officers getting down to change the tyre while I assisted. After changing the tyre, they gave me a pack of sachet water to wash my hands, then I was wanting for their next move\u2026 To my surprise they simply wished me well as I continued my journey, absolutely no request or demand for anything. So I want to say a very big thank you to officers Zakari, Adeyemi and Augustine for really demonstrating that the police can really be your friend. Just about the same time, another driver pulled over who had missed his way, they were equally as helpful with such gracious attitude. Sometimes, we look for the spirit of the New Nigeria in the wrong places, but that Saturday I was excited to see that the spirit of the New Nigeria is already at work all around us, modelled by simple everyday people. With all the negative things that come out of the Nigerian Police Force, it was so amazing seeing these men of the Nigerian Police demonstrate such selflessness at no cost. To officers Zakari, Adeyemi and Augustine, I salute and honour you for your conduct. I pray you will see and enjoy the reward of the good investment you are making in this country. I hope this can somehow get to the Force authorities. God bless you!\u201d The second story is as heart-warming as the one I have just related. This one had even the fortune of being recognised by the Presidency itself. It was an episode that unfolded at the Murtala Mohammed International Airport Lagos. From what I have picked from a Daily Trust report in the issue of 23rd August 2018 and other sources the story relates to two security men who returned a handbag filled with valuables that was forgotten at the airport by an American returnee. The report continued: \u201cA Lagos-based medical doctor, Banji Oyegbami, had gone to the airport to welcome a friend who was returning to the country from America with his family on August 18, 2018. In the process of loading their luggage into the car of their host, the handbag of the returnee\u2019s wife fell, unknown to anyone. It was not till 90 minutes later that an officer of the Halogen Securities, on duty at the airport, called the couple, to come for the received bag. When the bag was eventually collected, the contents, including a handsome amount of American dollars, phone, wristwatch, and other valuables were intact. The grateful couple offered a generous gift but Messrs Francis Emepueaku, and Achi Daniel declined saying they were merely doing their duties.\u201d This act of the security men was celebrated nation-wide. Their company, the Halogen Securities Ltd held a party in their honour where they were showered with scholarship for their children and a sum of N250,000 each. Daniel Achi who actually found the bag was reported to have told journalists at the reception that, \u201cIt never crossed my mind to steal the money and I wouldn\u2019t have done that because it wasn\u2019t my first time of finding such and returning to the owner. No amount of money would make me to take what doesn\u2019t belong to me. I believe my own time will come and at the right time. Achi\u2019s firm belief in the righteousness of his action is already been acknowledged. President Muhammadu Buhari has noted the honest disposition of the two security men. In a statement released by his Special Adviser on Media and Publicity, the President said such conduct reflects \u201cthe new Nigeria we all desire\u201d. You can be sure that more kudos are on their way to celebrate these worthy sons of the nation. The third event occurred in far-away Saudi Arabia where a Nigerian pilgrim currently performing the Hajj has returned the equivalent of over N4 million said to be lost by another pilgrim in Mecca. Musa Mohammed Edotsu, a Niger State indigene was reported to have found the money in one of the conveniences in the Niger State Pilgrims village in Mecca. A journalist, Abdul Isa reported from the Holy Land in his WhatsApp page that the Nigerian pilgrim returned the money which included dollars, Saudi riyals and dirhams to Niger State Pilgrims officials who in turn gave the money to the owner. According to the reporter the money belongs to the Chairman of the Enugu State Pilgrims Board, Zukalraini Sa\u2019eed. The honest pilgrim Musa Mohammed Edotsu has already received official recognition in Mecca where the Niger State Amirul Hajj, Abubakar Magaji commended the act and even rewarded him with $200. These acts of honesty and selflessness among the ordinary Nigerians is an indication that all is not lost. There is an abundant capacity in the country to turn the tides and put the shine once more on all of us. There had been a glut of bad news ranging from suicide bombings, outright banditry, brazen kidnappings and official corruption. We are probably one of the few countries in the world where large sums of monies (equivalent to a state or ministry\u2019s budget) are routinely discovered in warehouses and private dwellings. The wide reportage of these good deeds now is a signal that there is optimism in the air and we are ready for the good news. Who succeeds the governors? FOR the Governors ending their tenure, it is becoming nightmarish finding a successor who would continue the good works and not upset the apple cart. It is more nightmarish for the two Governors that have lived through the insurgency, Yobe State\u2019s Ibrahim Geidam and Borno State\u2019s Kashim Shettima, and have a peculiar situation at hand. They would definitely want someone with the capacity to handle the difficulties of governance that have arisen from the destructions caused by the insurgents. In that case, it is understandable if they are ruffled by suggestions as to who succeeds them. The body language of the Borno State Governor, Kashim Shettima implied so when he hosted members of his cabinet and party officials to a Sallah lunch at the Maiduguri Government House. He was quoted in a Premium Times report of 22/08/2018 as saying that, \u201cwhether one likes it or not, Allah has destined who the next governor of Borno will be\u201d. We shall return to the subject next week as we examine what is needed to govern a post-insurgency state? Keep a date with this page. Related",

        "text": "By Bisi Lawrence THE ENTRY OF Ayo Oshitelu into sports reporting was bound to bring one or two changes into the art of sports writing. Very seldom had the Ivory Tower released a choice product from its dizzy heights straight into the \u201cArena\u201d of sports. Apart from the incomparable Nnamdi Azikiwe, not very often had university graduates gravitated to the lowly sports desk while the editorial desk and various correspondent positions of a more prestigious flavour beckoned. But Ayo Oshitelu wanted to write sports. And how! First of all, of course, he loved sports. He had the advantage of attending schools which had a history of grand sports activities, and he lived in the environment of such a school even in his younger days. He therefore played a variety of games. He was a sturdy goal keeper, a dependable cricketer, and a passionate tennis player\u2014both the lawn and the ping-pong types. He was also a natural competitor, ever willing to confront challenges and excel. It all came to him naturally. He shone without any flamboyance but with a compelling brilliance. Apart from a fluid and unpretentious style free of the professional jargon of the day, Oshitelu infused a tone of propriety and integrity into his reports and commentaries. He made this point boldly in an incident which involved the fortunes of Nigeria against Ethiopia in a qualifying match for an international competition. The entire sports-writing cadre of the Nigerian press was up in arms against Ethiopia over the issue\u2014except Ayo. He told it like he saw it, and stuck to his guns. He left many of his colleagues stunned, but they had to gradually subscribe to his position which was that patriotism was one thing, but honesty was another. It was not just \u201cmy country, right or wrong\u201d, but really \u201cmy country, right and wrong\u201d. Some men are gentle, by nature. Some others are gentlemen, in stature. Oshitelu was a gentle, gentleman. His venture into politics was occasioned by the opportunities he saw that it offered for sound community development, especially among the youth. But politics was definitely not his speed, least of all, the cutthroat Nigerian brand. All the same, he set a tone that others may find as a worthy legacy. I shall miss him, of course. Grand sports writer, decent gentleman and pleasant company, but above all, he was a benefactor to me personally. I had retired as the General Manager of Radio Lagos in good circumstances and, one might say, I was somewhat fulfilled. But I still had a yen for writing, and felt that sports beckoned for the employment of the experience I had garnered over the years of reporting on radio, and organizing in football, and boxing and table tennis etc. So I approached several of those I identified as colleagues though they were really junior to me in the profession. To a man, they turned me down. If I had needed that activity for financial sustenance, the negative reception I received might have been enough to cause a mental breakdown. But then Ayo Oshitelu came on the scene. I had not even gone directly to him. Rather, I had gone to his editor who was much closer to me but had turned down my request to write sports for his paper. Ayo was the Sports Editor and was scandalized when he heard about it. He went and confronted the editor \u2014 who shall be nameless \u2014with me in tow. He informed the gentleman that, as the man in charge of sports, he would take full responsibility for my tenure in the sports page and should be left with the decision. He went to bat for me in no uncertain manner, in a way that almost brought tears to may eyes. It was one of the most moving moments of my life. That was how I came back into the media, first with sports and then with other themes. It was all through the effort of Ayo Oshitelu who never took the slightest advantage for it, and kept calling me egbon (big brother) till the last. Today my heart Overflows with gratitude to God for his beautiful life,and the way it impacted on mine. God grant him eternal rest. \u2013 for another sixty years Pundits generally agree in the United States, that the race for the White House in 2016 began the day after the end of the race for 2012 ended in favour of Barak Obama for his second presidency term. The brouhaha over the \u201cFiscal Cliff\u2019 which is a term underlining the timeliness required for the determination of a tax law that would, in this case, shed a brilliant light on the Obama administration was part of the manifest action involved in the effort of the Democrats and the Republicans to acquire the pole position in the race. There were no posters or rallies. But every stakeholder was aware of the swirling current beneath the apparently smooth surface. The ripples on the surface of our political movement here is more telling. The turmoil within the party which holds sway at the National Assembly cannot but affect the climate of our politics generally. The Peoples Democratic Party does not possess the reputation of a calm nature in its operations. Even so, the contention that seems to bedevil each organizational procedure of the party in normal times has now developed horns. We must agree that a lot is wrong with the structure and future of a political party which boasts of the highest number of members in the country\u2014and probably even on the Continent\u2014when it cannot successfully hold an election of its Board of Trustees, a matter that is hardly more than routine, because of internal strife. The melee within the party pits the State Governors against the Presidency; the State Governors against the National Party Chairman; the Chairman of the party himself against his Secretary (since removed); a former President against the sitting one; the supporters of one side against the supporters of the other side; and everybody against everybody else. Order appears to have been trampled to the floor in a political party that once boasted of the assurance to rule the country for another sixty\u2014 or was it six hundred \u2014years? Some of the personalities involved in the free-for-all atmosphere of the internal tussle within the PDP would tend to make one wish they had effected a definite disconnect from the party a while back, owing to their disruptive influence on politics in the past. For instance, one could contemplate the severance of Chief (General) Olusegun Obasanjo from active participation in PDP affairs with only a heavy sigh of relief. Since he earned the reputation of a military head of state, who favoured democracy to the extent that he willingly returned the reins of power to civilian hands, no other head of state has escaped his scathing comments, whether it be in the direction of fiscal management or security establishment. He started almost on the first day of Shagari, his successor\u2019s administration, with the declaration of an austerity with \u201ca human face\u201d, and followed through with Abiola, who did not even make it to the Presidency, with the aspersion as to whether he was \u201cthe Messiah\u201d. Of course, when he engaged a man called Abacha in such antics, we all know he almost came a cropper. Now Jonathan is at the wicket for his own innings, and he is told he must rout insurgents with fire and sword and, at the same time, engage them in a dialogue. Obasanjo is the only Nigerian who has governed as a military and civilian ruler at different times. He received the surrender of the Biafran forces at the end of the Civil War .. \u201c He not only handed over power to a civilian government, being a military ruler as already recounted above, he also processed the succession of his civilian administration by another civilian government. He later took up the reins of the Board of Trustees of his party through a constitutional process he had himself tailored to his size. In a word, he has done it all! His party needs fresh ideas that can hardly be aligned with his preoccupation of self-centred passion. In the mean time, other forces are gathering to unseat his party. The \u201copposition\u201d is all set once again to ridicule itself in a burlesque of sheer buffoonery. The political parties that do enjoy a modest regard at this time as the opposition, thanks to the PDP\u2019s chicanery, are determined to put up another public show of mutual distrust, the like of which we are called to witness seasonally now, about their concerted effort to oust the PDP from power. That is their agenda from top to bottom. They mention words like \u201cmerger\u201d in a situation where the components contemplated simply have no common aspects or properties. Rather, the elements are as repellent, as the \u201clike poles\u201d of a magnetic rod. The leaders of these parties are \u201cpotentates\u201d each in his own right; each wrapped in the armour of his own self-importance; each with his own iron-cast agenda. As someone would be disposed to say, \u201cI dey laugh o!\u201d Anyway, the first posters of the 2015 elections are out already, whether they are denied or disowned. If the PDP does not disintegrate from within, it will probably win again. And you know why. It is for the simple reason that Nigeria is riddled with corruption. We all pay service to its eradication only with our lips. And maggots thrive in filth. Happy New year. Time out Related",

        "text": "\u2013 the fun-loving, but hardworking single parent By Treena Kwenta Hi Readers! The gals were enjoying themselves so much at the party for Heather, Robert and Milwan at Becky\u2019s place that we didn\u2019t leave, after all. \u201cSorry gals, have you noticed that as far as these guys here are concerned, we don\u2019t exist?\u201d observed Liz. \u201cWith the exception of our own children, none of them seems to see any adult around.\u201d \u201cThat was what I noticed, myself,\u201d acknowledged Tayo, \u201c and I was wondering if we need to bother leaving. They seem to be enjoying themselves without a care in the world about who might be watching them. Why don\u2019t we stay, then disperse from here? Hey, Becky, I hope our drivers are being taken care of.\u201d \u201cDrivers? They don\u2019t wait for people to remember to come serve them. They off-load oga or madam, park their vehicles, then find their way into the party venue; unless you tell them to keep out. All your drivers are in that corner of the swimming pool. Can you see them?\u201d \u201cOh, that\u2019s true. I can see them. They\u2019re eating and drinking. Becky, please ensure that no alcohol is served them. We don\u2019t want them being drunk at the wheel. One of the pool drivers I used last month fell asleep at the wheel when we were in a traffic build-up. I had a hard time getting him to wake up and move when the traffic started flowing. Even then, he was in no condition to drive as he kept falling asleep. I got scared, you know. Had someone drugged him, I wondered. He was incoherent and he couldn\u2019t keep awake. It was when I asked him to move over so that I could take over the wheel that I smelt heavy alcohol on his breath. The guy was roaring drunk! What if I couldn\u2019t drive or didn\u2019t have my driver\u2019s licence on me? I drove both of us back to the office and drew the head driver\u2019s attention to his condition. I learnt he had only recently been employed. The guy could have had one killed! I was quite shaken. I haven\u2019t seen him since then. They must have fired him.\u201d \u201cWhere did he get the alcohol from?\u201d I asked. \u201cSearch me! He probably had a small bottle of ogogoro or another hot drink hidden somewhere on his person or in the vehicle. Since then, I\u2019ve taken to searching any vehicle I\u2019m using, for alcohol, and smelling the breath of even the drivers who\u2019ve been with me for years. You can\u2019t take chances.\u201d \u201cI regularly have all our drivers at work searched and tested for alcohol while they\u2019re at work,\u201d said Liz. \u201cA few of our vehicles got smashed due to drink driving, and management was furious. So, I had to come up with that precaution.\u201d \u201cThat was smart of you, Liz dear. I hope you understand our fears, Becky dear\u201d \u201cDon\u2019t worry, Tayo dear,\u201d Becky assured. \u201cYou forget that we don\u2019t take alcohol in this house, and there\u2019s no way we can allow it to be served on our premises. \u201d \u201cYes, of course. I had forgotten that. I usually make that plea when my driver is with me on an outing. You know, some drivers have a way of bullying the servers to give them beer or stout. Hey, Treena! Do you see what I\u2019m seeing around Milwan?\u201d \u201cYou mean two ladies trying to outdo each other for his attention?\u201d \u201cYes, who are they? Okay, I can see that the one on his left is Ann, Belinda\u2019s niece. But who\u2019s that very pretty girl on his right? She looks so young and sweet too.\u201d \u201cOh wao!\u201d said Liz. \u201cShe looks warm and attractive. The sort of girl a mother would like brought home to be introduced to her. \u201dTreena, you should accept this one o, if Miwan says she\u2019s his choice,\u201d\u201c said Boma. \u201cI like her. She looks so innocent and nice. The type that will respect her in-laws. She looks well-brought up too.\u201d\u201c \u201cYou mean you can deduce all this merely by looking at her?\u201d I asked, amazed. \u201cWell you can always tell by observing them from afar,\u201d said Becky. \u201cI did that with each of the girls my two eldest sons brought home. I first observed them from afar when they didn\u2019t know that I was watching them. So, by the time my sons brought them to introduce to their dad and me, I had made up my mind that they would be good daughters-in-law. They\u2019ve not disappointed me yet. I pray they don\u2019t. They\u2019re good Christians. Oh, I had disapproved of several girls before those ones came along. Er, this girl with Milwan looks okay. Doesn\u2019t look pushy.\u201d\u201c \u201dSo, Treena dear, should we start saving up for their marriage?\u201d joked Boma. \u201dHas Milwan said that marriage is on his cards now, and that this is his preference?\u201d I asked, a bit vexed, without any reason. What was the matter with me? The girl looked harmless to me and anyway, Milwan hadn\u2019t introduced her to me yet, let alone tell me that he would like to marry her. Yet, I just didn\u2019t feel comfortable with the thought that she could be his ideal girl to marry. Oh, I want him to get married as soon as possible, but \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026. \u201cOkay gals,\u201d said Tayo. \u201cLet\u2019s drop talk of marriage between Milwan and that girl or anyone else. Our friend here doesn\u2019t seem eager to let her son go yet. Don\u2019t provoke her wrath by trying to match him with any girl.\u201d I said nothing to that comment because it suited me, and I didn\u2019t want to prolong the conversation. I just wanted to sit back and continue enjoying the party. About half an hour later, I looked towards where Milwan had been sitting. He wasn\u2019t there. Ann was on the dance floor dancing with some female guests, looking radiant and happy. Heather and Robert were merged into one on the floor, dancing slowly, unaware that the rest of us were around. Very neat. As I was wondering where my son was, he suddenly appeared in front of us, with the other girl in tow. Oh ah! She was indeed lovely, but at close quarters, in a brash way. \u201dAunties, mum,\u201d said Milwan with a bow, \u201dI came to find out how you are. I know you\u2019re the ones who put this party together for us, but are you okay? Do you have everything you want? Would you want me to ask a server to come take your orders?\u201d \u201dWe\u2019re fine, Milwan dear,\u201d said Tayo, getting up to pat him on the cheek. \u201dWould you like to dance?\u201d That raised laughter from us. \u201dOh no! Thank you. I suppose I\u2019m speaking for every one of us,\u201d said Liz. \u201dYes.\u201d was our chorus. \u201dThat\u2019s sweet of you, Milwan dear,\u201d said Boma. \u201dAt our ages, when we want to dance, we just get up and get on with it, probably with some friends; like I see Ann doing. She\u2019s enjoying herself, isn\u2019t it?\u201d \u201dOh yes, auntie,\u201d said Milwan with a little laugh. \u201dAnn is always fun to be with. She\u2019s enjoying herself. Tomorrow she goes down with the kids to meet up with the husband for Christmas. Then, they\u2019ll all go back to the U.S. She\u2019s doing fine there, and Smart is thinking of moving there too to continue in the hospitality business.\u201d\u201c \u201dWill that pay him there? I would have thought he\u2019\u2018s better off in Port Harcourt where they know his worth at managing hotels.\u201d observed Boma. \u201dAnn says he wants the family together, and since the kids are schooling in the U.S. and are doing well, he felt he shouldn\u2019t be here in Nigeria. Ann doesn\u2019t mind the distance between them, though. She says distance keep marriage alive and well for couples. I don\u2019t subscribe to that, but that\u2019s Ann\u2019s idea of bliss in a union. Okay, aunties, mum, I must go back now. I\u2019m required to give the vote of thanks in an hour\u2019s time, so, I must circulate meanwhile.\u201d\u201c \u201dThanks for coming to us,\u201d I told him. I looked from him to the girl by his side; waiting for him to introduce her to us, but he didn\u2019t seem to want to. He looked me straight in the eye and raised his eyebrow. He bowed again and was going to leave us, but the girl didn\u2019t want to leave without letting us know who she is, so, she took his hand and turned him gently to face us again. \u201cSorry aunties,\u201d she said with a pretty smile. \u201cIt would be rude of me to leave you without you knowing who came over with Milwan to greet you. I\u2019m Seyi; daughter of Chief and Chief (Mrs.) \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026 of \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.\u201d \u201cYou\u2019re kidding!\u201d said Tayo, getting up to hug her affectionately. \u201cI know your dad very well, and er, your mum too. How are they these days? I haven\u2019t seen your dad for years, since he retired from the board of my company.\u201d \u201cOh really, ma?\u201d said Seyi, her eyes lighting up. \u201cI\u2019ll mention you to him. Perhaps you have your call card on you, ma?\u201d \u201cSorry, I don\u2019t have one on me right now. When I said my company, I meant the organization I work for, not my own company.\u201d \u201cI understand perfectly well, ma. I\u2019m sure he\u2019ll be glad to hear I met you. He and mum have retired fully now and they spend their time mainly abroad where my older siblings are \u2013 the United States, actually. I\u2019m last born and I\u2019m due to go do my Masters there too, but Milwan\u2019s trying to convince me that Britain is the best place for me to do it.\u201d Milwan looked startled by what she said, and he looked at her in surprise. She smiled sweetly at him and patted him on the shoulder. \u201cWell, my unsolicited advice is that you should do what daddy and mummy say you should do,\u201d offered Tayo. \u201cThey must have their reason for wanting you to join your siblings in the U.S. Come to think of it, your dad, er, sorry, your parents, do have one or two houses there, don\u2019t they? In New Jersey, I think.\u201d \u201cYou\u2019re right, ma. But if Milwan wants me in Britain, I would want to be there.\u201d We all smiled and fixed our eyes on Milwan. Embarrassed, he threw up his hand, as if in defence. Tayo spared his blushes as she turned to introduce the gals to Seyi. She was surprised to know that I was Milwan\u2019s mother. She had assumed Tayo was, and I suppose that was why she responded warmly to her. I\u2019m sure she would have turned to me, if she had known that I was Milwan\u2019s mum. She looked at me in awe, but I smiled gently at her, saying nothing. Milwan bowed to us again and they took their leave of us. \u201cHm! Looks can be deceptive!\u201d observed Liz. \u201cThat girl is wide-awake and pushy.\u201d \u201cShe seems a handful,\u201d added Boma. \u201cAnd a trifle manipulative,\u201d said Tayo. \u201cLike her dad,\u201d she added after a while. \u201cNot all that glitters is gold,\u201d said Becky. \u201cWhat do you think of her, Treena dear?\u201d \u201cNo comment.\u201d I told my friends cheerfully. Tara. Related",

        "text": "By Donu Kogbara NIGERIANS have always complained bitterly about the countless inadequacies of their country and multiple shortcomings of their leaders. But the complaints have been even more embittered than usual ever since 2009 dawned nearly 12 months ago because this has been a particularly bad year for almost everyone. Every nation contains exceptions to the rule \"\u201c as in Special People who do well against all the odds and despite the most challenging of circumstances. Even during the dark bad old days of apartheid in South Africa when the black majority was being treated abominably by the ruling white minority, there were black entrepreneurs like Richard Maponya who rose above the constant racial harrassment they faced and doggedly transformed themselves into tycoons. The same can be said of Nigeria. Here, there are quite a few way-above-average men and women who do not suffer the same privations as ordinary citizens. And, sure, some of these highly successful Nigerians are especially clever or especially industrious or especially shrewd or especially intuitive or especially beautiful or especially whatever. But most are just plain lucky and became highly successful NOT because they are anything to write home about but purely because they accidentally happened to be in the right place at the right time OR only because they happened to be close to someone who was in a powerful position. Also please note that since criminal tendencies are rarely a disadvantage within our essentially jungle-esque environment, some highly successful individuals have became highly successful simply because they are ruthless crooks who covertly or overtly break every law in the book and don't know the meaning of common decency. Anyway, dear readers, those rare, especially fortunate folks who have acquired deserved or undeserved riches via various means are not my main focus today. I've mentioned them only because it is desirable to provide a balanced picture and acknowledge the fact that not everyone in this country is struggling. But I am only seriously interested, at the moment, in the millions of normal Nigerians who are not enjoying any significant successes and are finding it extremely difficult to survive and thrive. And I feel so sad and enraged whenever I think about all those dashed dreams, wasted talents and anguished existences. Things were bad enough before the President went abroad for medical treatment. And his prolonged absence has made things even worse. We have a right to know whether our Oga is OK or not, but the whole issue of his health is shrouded in secrecy. Depressing rumours abound; and one is liable to be accused of treason if one dares to wonder aloud whether he is still alive in any real sense of the word. People are feeling immensely insecure about the present and expressing major fears about their tomorrows. And I urge PDP stalwarts \"\u201c who have a moral duty to restore public confidence and provide us with a lot more protection and prosperity \"\u201c to put us out of our misery and do their jobs properly. The President's condition is neither here nor there at the end of the day, given that Government is a collective effort rather than a One-Man band, and that it almost doesn't matter who is in charge, as long as the country is being run well. Whether Yar'Adua returns to the hot seat or not, there will, for the forseeable future, be plenty of obstacles to be overcome in terms of national development. A friend who lives in Port Harcourt decided to count the number of electricity outages that afflicted his housing estate one weekend last month and he tells me that PHCN \"took light\"\u009d 51 times between the Friday night and Sunday morning. And what about the many other disgraceful messes we have to contend with? Take our healthcare, education and railway systems, for example: The President is currently on the other side of the world because there is no sufficiently sophisticated hospital here. Meanwhile, most of our schools are jokes; and we have added almost nothing to the sound railway network we inherited from British colonialists in l960 and have, in addition, allowed the network to fall into disrepair. As for capacity-building, forget it! Since I moved here from the UK, I have noticed that most of our VIPs are aggressively allergic to worthwhile personnel. Often, the more able and exposed you are, the more they resent, suppress and impoverish you! Many Governors and Ministers are too selfish to act on the fact that a nation or state that doesn't encourage its best brains to be productive \"\u201c and regards folks who have integrity with suspicion \u2013 is depriving itself of useful human resources. As far as these enemies of progress are concerned, it is more important to promote mediocre people on the basis of their tribal origins \"\u201c or to provide as much patronage as possible to rapacious girlfriends and dubious cronies whose only skills are sexual shenanigans, election-rigging and looting the Treasury.

        "text": "By Donu Kogbara LAST week, I said on this page that I had grave reservations about President Buhari\u2019s active involvement in a non-Nigerian political crisis that had been brought on by his Gambian counterpart Yahya Jammeh\u2019s undemocratic misconduct. Jammeh who had ruled his country with an iron fist for two decades, had adamantly refused to step down after he lost the recent Gambian presidential election; and African heads of state, led by Buhari, had first tried to persuade him to do the right thing, then threatened military action when their advice fell on deaf ears. A handout picture released by the Nigerian Presidency on January 13, 2017 shows Nigeria President Muhammadu Buhari (L) Liberian President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf (2nd L), former Ghana President, John Dramani Mahama (2nd R) and an unidentified woman meeting with Gambian President Yahia Jammeh in Banjul. West African leaders began crisis talks with President Yahya Jammeh on January 13 over his refusal to leave power, as fears grew of a refugee exodus caused by the nation\u2019s political impasse. Nigerian President Muhammadu Buhari is leading the three-nation delegation that includes Ghana\u2019s former president John Mahama and Liberian leader Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, who attempted similar negotiations last month without success. / AFP PHOTO I agreed that it was morally justifiable to apply multinational pressure on a shameless sit-tight dictator. But I was uncomfortable about Buhari\u2019s preoccupation with Gambian issues at a time when we have so many pressing problems of our own in this country and the government is struggling to cope with Niger Delta militants, Boko Haram terrorists, Biafran activists, rampaging Fulani herdsmen and so on. But all\u2019s well that ends well. Fortunately \u2013 thank God! \u2013 Jammeh suddenly saw the light and decided, at the eleventh hour, to avoid a Big Fight that would probably have consumed him, caused several deaths, cost a fortune and catapulted Gambia into prolonged turmoil. So he caved in last weekend and reluctantly slunk off into exile (to Equatorial Guinea with his family and various ill-gotten luxury items, including two Rolls Royces). Buhari and his ECOWAS colleagues (Liberian President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, for example) deserve to be congratulated \u2013 and thanked by the Gambian people and their new Commander-In-Chief, Adama Barrow \u2013 for an excellent bloodless result. Buhari should now vigorously knuckle down to his core responsibilities here. When there are numerous fierce fires that need to be put out on your home turf \u2013 and when many folks who happily voted for you less than two years ago are feeling let down and have taken to angrily describing you as a huge disappointment \u2013 effective, domestic dynamism is more important than triumphant foreign interventions! NEDC versus NDDC GOVERNORS of the six states in the North-East have pledged to ensure that the proposed North East Development Commission, NEDC, out-performs the Niger Delta Development Commission, NDDC, which is widely regarded as having failed to add value to the oil-producing areas it was established to serve 16 years ago. While visiting the 8th National Assembly with a delegation comprising other governors and various dignitaries from his zone, Alhaji Kassim Shettima, the Borno State governor, thanked legislators for passing the NEDC Bill, then said that: Human capacity \u201cA lot of Nigerians within and outside the Niger Delta do not give a good score to the NDDC\u201d because they feel that it has not done enough to boost living standards, develop human capacity and improve infrastructure. He also said that: \u201cWhile this [viewpoint] can be debated by those in a position to know better, we the governors of the North-East are of the strong opinion that\u2026we must learn from the experience of the NDDC\u2026so we can take preventive measures that should ensure that persons of impeccable character are entrusted to manage the NEDC\u2026a lifeline that we must not allow anyone to toy with.\u201d I really hope that Shettima is being sincere because, as he pointed out, the North-East \u2013 which has been badly hit by a Boko Haram insurgency that has damaged or destroyed countless schools, health centres, police stations and local government secretariats \u2013 is the poorest zone and inhabited by thousands of orphans and widows, as well as millions of uneducated children, who desperately need help. It is also worth noting that many North-Easterners have lost their homes and are stranded in grim camps for the internally displaced, with no sources of income. Shettima has been quoted as ascribing the NDDC\u2019s failures to \u201cinappropriate leadership\u201d and he is 100 per cent right to say that the NEDC can only \u201cprotect, promote, preserve and defend the objectives for which the Bill was passed\u201d if it is properly-run and avoids the mistakes that the NDDC has made. And if Shettima and his colleagues resist the temptation to be typical dodgy politicians and don\u2019t treat the NEDC as if it is their personal cash cow or fill it with corrupt cronies, inept relatives and moronic girlfriends, the NEDC will stand a chance of fulfilling its moral obligations to the constituents it is supposed to serve. If Shettima and his colleagues genuinely want the NEDC to become an exemplary organisation that transform lives, they must insist that it operates meritocratically, professionally and ethically\u2026and provide competent and honest North-Eastern Christians and North-Eastern Muslims with equal opportunities. Let\u2019s wait and see how Shetima et al handle this upcoming challenge. In the meantime, I have to say that Northern grandees who accuse senior NDDC personnel of mismanagement are guilty of hypocrisy because Northern grandees are one of the reasons why the NDDC has not done well or earned respect!!! Leadership\u2019s shortcomings Yes, the NDDC leadership has been far from ideal. And some of the leadership\u2019s shortcomings and failures cannot be blamed on anyone except the leadership. But it is common knowledge that many NDDC contracts that should have been used as a means of empowering Niger Deltans have been awarded to Northern grandees. Furthermore, rumour has it that some of these contracts have been fraudulently inflated\u2026and that not all have been executed, never mind to a high standard. According to an NDDC executive, who wishes to remain nameless: \u201cIf you ask me, the NDDC was programmed to fail from day one because it has been subjected to constant interference from VIPs from other parts of the country, especially the North, and has not been allowed to concentrate on supporting Niger Deltans.\u201d When the NEDC is up and running, will any Niger Deltan get an NEDC contract? I doubt it! And you know what, dear Vanguard Readers? I won\u2019t complain if my kith and kin can\u2019t benefit from NEDC funds because I am consistent. I think that the NDDC should focus exclusively on taking care of Niger Deltans and that the NEDC should focus exclusively on taking care of our North-Eastern brethren. End of story!!! Related",

        "author": "Rotimi Fasan",
        "text": "By Rotimi Fasan Just when you think you've seen all there is to be seen about the strange ways of the Yar'Adua administration and some of its officials, then will the government spring yet another one on you. The administration has reduced governance to a game of fumblers, a blind man's buff in which people stumble from one foolish decision to another even more foolish. We only need to look back at and remind ourselves of a few incidents that have caused much angst for Nigerians and brought the country to the very brink of systemic breakdown, to realise not just how low our rulers have fallen but how poor is the decision-making credentials of today's rulers. After years of playing hide-and-seek with university teachers, refusing to sign agreements reached with the umbrella union of lecturers, the government is hopefully back to do what it ought to have done long before now. But that only after lecturers had gone on a four-month strike which would be compounded by the unprecedented step taken by the same government to call off negotiations with the lecturers. All over the world it is labour leaders that refuse to negotiate. Even then, government as employer of labour never give up, they are ever ready to talk things out with unions. That was, however, not the case with the 'Federal' government under Yar'Adua. Rather than follow a wise and universally-entrenched tradition, this government, through its negotiating team headed by individuals who cannot set aside their oversized personal egos in order to do the things required of them, decided the only way to address the matter was to boycott discussions. And it is doubtful that the administration would have retraced its foolish step had its head, President Yar'Adua, not made the royally foolish move of going to open a university in Saudi Arabia at this material time that Nigerian universities had been under lock and key for several months. It was partly in the bid to deflect criticism of this action, and the other one emanating from Yar'Adua's failure to be in New York with his counterparts attending the UN General Assembly, that the government hurriedly resumed discussions with the Academic Staff Union of Universities. Before the Yar'Adua blunder, Sam Egwu, the Education Minister, had allegedly wasted many millions of Naira on his\u00c2 25th wedding anniversary while calling ASUU names for seeking better funding of our universities. On other occasions Nigerians would watch, open-mouthed, as the Attorney General and Minister of Justice work assiduously to subvert the course of justice by a stiff-necked refusal to cooperate with foreign security agencies, even those assisting to recover looted funds from the country. But the same government is not averse to persecuting those it perceives as its enemies. That foolish game of personal vendetta against perceived enemies of state is the only explanation for why government, a supposedly democratic government, would refuse to renew the passports of two Nigerians that had played central roles in the immediate past government of Obasanjo before falling on the wrong side of the Yar'Adua government. Nasir El-Rufai and Nuhu Ribadu, favourite sons of Obasanjo in whom he was well pleased, are two Nigerians that enjoyed under Obasanjo the sparkling image of \u2018Mr.Clean\u2019 along with a take-no-prisoner approach to their duties, right or wrong. We need not go into the details of how both men fell from grace and came to incur the wrath of today's men of 'timber and calibre'. Those details are too well known to bear repeating. Suffice to say that today they have been declared not just persona-non-grata in Nigeria, their very status as Nigerians is no longer recognised- at least by this government. By denying them the right to own and/or renew their passports, government is effectively saying it has no responsibility to protect them anymore nor do they deserve the rights and privileges conferred by possession of Nigerian citizenship which can be obtained by either birth or naturalisation. El-Rufai and Ribadu are Nigerians by birth and despite attempts by this government to smear them, treating them as fugitive offenders who must be brought home, fair or foul, to face 'justice', nothing criminal has been found against them. Ribadu was so sure of this that he visited the country some weeks ago to commiserate with the Gani Fawehinmi family on the passing of Gani. The Nigerian government which must have all along been aware of and taken aback by the brazenness of the visit even as it must have realised it had no case against the man- the government simply turned a blind eye on Ribadu only to turn around later with claims, through IG Ogbonaya Onovo,\u00c2 that the man never visited the country. This, despite press photographs and interviews, proving Onovo got it wrong. There had been talks about both men possessing properties abroad and/or failing to declare their assets prior to and after their tenure in office, but all of these came to nothing. Which is to say that until the contrary is proven, this government is guilty of persecuting two Nigerians who served their fatherland diligently by denying them the right to own and possess Nigerian international passport. The last time things like this happened was under the military. The efforts ended in failure as would the latest one- ultimately. Many would say that the April 22, 1990 Gideon Orka coup failed precisely because its makers sought to excise parts of the country north of the Niger, to wit deny Nigerians from there their Nigerian citizenship. It was also the military under Abacha that denied the likes of Wole Soyinka and other pro-democracy activists the right to carry Nigerian passports. No government or its officials has the right to deny any Nigerian rights and privileges guaranteed by the constitution. Ribadu and El Rufai until proven otherwise are Nigerian patriots and deserve to be so treated. Related",

        "author": "OBI NWAKANMA",
        "text": "By OBI NWAKANMA A reader of this column sent me a note last week thanking me for bringing the situation in Imo state to light, and for being in what he calls \"informed opposition.\"\u009d I did thank him, but I made it clear that I'm not in opposition to Ohakim. I am a critic of the government that he leads. An opposition is an organized platform \"\u201c a sort of government in waiting \"\u201c with its alternative programs and ideas in clear distinction from the government of the day in a democracy. Sometimes they draw critical insights from informed sources to canvas their position among the electorate. But there is no opposition in Imo state. There is political opportunism. That is why the Imo state government is looking, and increasingly sounding surreal and weird. We grew up in the East as the inheritors of fine examples of\u00c2 robust and dynamic leadership that saw Nnamdi Azikiwe straddling the African imagination like a force of nature, or men like Michael Iheonukara Okpara, whose leadership of the East remains without compare. While the Igbo was riding the crest of development and progress from 1957 to 1967, it felt like the rest of Nigeria could not touch its political helms, what with such colorful and eponymous names among its leaders: Akanu Ibiam, educator and missionary doctor, who approached\u00c2 public service with the instincts of a missionary. Denis Osadebe \"\u201c poet and brilliant legal mind, whose parliamentary skills were legendary. K.O. Mbadiwe \"\u201c\u00c2 man of timbre and caterpillar, not only full of rhetoric and bombast, but also full of purpose. A first class political strategist and negotiator who knew his personal interest alright, but never messed with the group interest, for always, the group was the basis of their politics. There was Mbonu Ojike, brilliant economic thinker of his generation, whose early death robbed the Igbo and Nigeria greatly. There was Nwafor Orizu; there was Jaja Wachukwu, there was Eni Njoku, there was Nwapa, there was Reuben Uzoma; there was Raymond Amanze Njoku, and there were numerous others, any of whom could have, were they born in any other clime, led any nation politically. I have said that perhaps the divine author of things played a terrible joke on the East and the Igbo particularly: he sent them a glut of first class men in one generation, and in a later generation gave them only burnt offering \"\u201c political lilliputs whose conduct of politics insults the illustrious past of our 20th century political ancestors. Today, there is no memorable Igbo politician. At the eventual passing of the great Dim Odumegwu-Ojukwu, the last of the relay of great Igbo leaders of the 20th century, the Igbo of Nigeria will not have a single memorable political figure who could rally them to great political purpose. For a people whose leaders were at the fore of the independence movement, this would be a great lesson in irony. The irony was made most poignant in the ring-kissing visit of Ikedi Ohakim, governor of Imo state, last week to Raji Fashola, governor of Lagos state. The highlights of that visit mark Mr. Ohakim, not only as a second fiddler, but also as a governor without a clear social or economic program, who does not deserve to be re-elected in the forthcoming elections as the governor over a great state like Imo. We must help him\u00c2 return him quickly to his personal business in Lagos, where he says Governor Raji Fashola has made the lives of the Igbo residents worth living and Igbo businesses secure. \"I have come to greet a great man, so that I too will be great\"\u009d said Ikedi Ohakim to Raji Fashola in Lagos. It sounds cute and gracious. But it also sounds like the servile declaration of a hopeful almajirin to his lordly benefactor. Ohakim was recently paid the left-handed compliment of the Sarduana Award for leadership. It is therefore not surprising from where Ikedi Ohakim draws his inspirations and examples: not from the great Zik or Okpara or Mbakwe. The trouble is that he is on his way to leading Imo state to beggarly ruin. True, Fashola stays in Lagos and directs its transmutation from a vast slum, while Ohakim gallivants, paying courtesy visits, and spouting strange excuses for his lack of achievement. Once, his excuse was that his opponents had stymied his mandate in court with litigation, and his hands were tied. Now, the Supreme Court has declared him governor, no such excuse is valid any longer. Now it is revenue: while Lagos has all the revenue, Ohakim says, Imo has all the ideas. This is poppycock of course. Across the fence in Enugu, we see slow but apparent change. Imo is richer in revenue and resources than Enugu. But Enugu has greater purpose. Governor Ohakim needs now to account for the revenue accruing to Imo state in the last three years-plus of his administration. There is no evidence of infrastructural investment. There is, of course, a lot of hot talk about really hot plans to build Oguta and Nworie into tourist utopia. There is nothing on the ground. There is much talk about rural roads. I went round Imo state last year, I saw only signposts proposing IRROMA. The road from Owerri to Umuahia, much touted as dualized, and commissioned by the late president Yar Adua, is in fact a glorified dirt road, not expanded, but divided with concrete barriers into a narrow two way macadam. Every school and hospital I visited in Imo state was in profound stages of decay. The main city, Owerri, is overcrowded\u00c2 and has lost the serenity of which Owerri was once known because of serious code violations. There is no evidence of new plans to recreate the city, or build new well developed counties and satellites, or even invest in new urban centers like Orlu, Okigwe, Oguta or the Ahiara-Aboh conurbation. At the office of the Owerri Capital Development Authority, there was nothing left but two old earth-movers, and a huge sign. There was an overwhelming sense of insecurity in Imo State \"\u201c I had never felt more unsafe in my life. The greatest development in Owerri is \"Keke Napep\"\u009d and the vast number of posters advertising Governor Ohakim colourfully. There was absolutely no doubt in my mind that Ikedi Ohakim was playing hoochie with Imo state. It has possibly to do with the party \"\u201c the PPA with which he came to power in Imo state \"\u201c which was some sort of ersatz arrangement foisted between Olusegun Obasanjo and Orji Uzor-Kalu on the East. It had no ideas. But it also seems to me that much has to do with Mr. Ohakim's own limitations: his servility to the golden calf of self-imagery for instance. I take again from Ohakim's statement to Raji Fashola to highlight my concern: \"people came from the Lagos\"\u009d Ohakim said, and asked the Igbo to invest in the stock market. The crash of the stock market, he claims is the cause of the kidnapping in the South-East because Igbo lost their investment. Ohakim is wrong on several fronts, but let me quickly say that the crime situation in the South-East is connected to the\u00c2 rapid impoverishment and alienation of a critical segment of the population as a result of the inability of government to provide social programs that would cushion the harsh economic environment, stimulate re-investment, create opportunities for young entrepreneurs and expand the growth of the job market both at the public and private sectors. What does Imo do with its federal allocations? What is its exact tax base? Perhaps it is time the people themselves \"\u201c long used to indolence and quiet desperation -get some backbone, and demand for accounting for the\u00c2 use of public funds, through either establishing an independent citizens auditing of the state's finances or through the auditing oversight of its House of Assembly \"\u201c which seems consistently complicit with the executive arm. It is time to stop our governor panhandling from Lagos; time to plug all the leaks through which public funds disappear. In short, it is time to get the priorities right in Imo state. It is time for this governor to stop clapping with one hand and get some serious work done. Related",

        "text": "By Josef Omorotoinmwan SOMETIMES, people want to engage in a war, which they cannot win. It is perhaps the case of sighting an antelope in the bush. You would want to pursue that fast-running animal for, you never can tell whether it has a bad leg. That is what the House of Representatives may be doing with a post-nomination President Jonathan. The man is not now in a position to bend backwards or kowtow to the lawmakers on things illegal. For two years running, the National Assembly has attempted to alter our fiscal year through the back door. It all started with the implementation of the 2009 Appropriation Act. We were all busy watching over the health of our late President, apparently oblivious of the fact that time was not waiting for anyone. Before we were fairly aware of what was happening, 2009 had rolled by and we had hardly started implementing the year\u2019s budget. Like in the tradition of most extensions, it became convenient to announce that the 2009 Appropriations would be implemented up to March 31, 2010. Evidently, one bad turn deserves another. In December 2010, it also became convenient to announce that the 2010 Appropriations would be implemented into March 2011. This was done through the Second Appropriation (Amendment) Bill, 2010. Perhaps unwittingly, the chain reaction here has pushed the nation into a 15-month financial year, no thanks to a tardy administration. Perhaps our President has now decided that we cannot continue in this illegality. After all, the Financial Year Act of 1980, which changed our financial year from 1st April 1 \u2013March 31 to January 1\u2013 December 31, has not been repealed. It was therefore appropriate to issue circulars to the ministries and extra- ministerial departments, directing them to stop implementation on the 2010 Appropriations. We think it is right to insist that 2010 Appropriations should be executed in 2010 and that 2011 cannot be part of 2010, going by our extant law. After all, we are not dealing with 2010/2011 Appropriations. In just the same way that you cannot postpone Christmas, you cannot by subsidiary legislation increase the number of days in a year. All we can do at this point is to close our eyes to the normal accounting practice, where even deep into the new financial year, your transactions could be made to bear December 31 of the preceding year. This is purely a marriage of convenience. In all of this, the House of Representatives thinks otherwise. On Tuesday, February 8, 2011, the House passed a resolution, directing the President to rescind his order to the ministries and extra-ministerial departments. The entire ground is rife with illegalities. Yes, the House of Representatives is right to think that the President is refusing to implement the Second Appropriation (Amendment) Law 2010, which the President, after all, assented to. Yes, the President is also right to think that for as long as he continues to obey the subsidiary law, we shall all be dragged into infringing on the provisions of a principal law, the Financial Year Act, 1980. Whichever way we go, head we lose; tail we do not win. Evidently, not everything that counts can be counted. Even in the confused state, we shall only survive the present situation by adopting one of the positions and glossing over the other. But that will be for the current year. What will happen next year and thereafter? What we have now is a fire-fighting approach to budget preparation and implementation. Under the current system, the President drags his feet till the final days of the year before going to throw the budget proposals to the National Assembly, just to fulfill all righteousness on the provisions of Section 81 (1) of the 1999 Constitution: \u201cThe President shall cause to be prepared and laid before each House of the National Assembly at any time in each financial year estimates of the revenues and expenditure of the Federation for the next following financial year\u201d. The National Assembly would only look at the proposals way after yuletide and its consideration would continue far into the financial year, thus leaving virtually no time for proper implementation. This writer has suggested somewhere else that if things must move properly in this country, there is simply no alternative to the development of a viable budgetary cycle for each tier of government (Daily Times, Thursday, May 29, 1980, page 7). The budgetary process is the soul of any organisation. It must be properly planned and carefully consummated. During the early days of Gahli Umar Na\u2019Abba as the Speaker of the House of Representatives, the idea of developing a budgetary cycle for Nigeria was mooted but like many good ideas in Nigeria, it was soon jettisoned. Point of information: President Obama submitted his 2012 budget message to the US Congress this past week. This is in compliance with the requirements of that country\u2019s budgetary cycle, which is based on the Congressional Budget and Impoundment Act, 1974: \u201cWithin 15 days after Congress convenes in January, the President submits his annual budget message to Congress. The Congressional Budget office analyses it and suggests alternatives\u2026\u201d. Can anyone beat that, particularly against the backdrop that our National Assembly has just started looking at our 2011 figures? The saying, early to bed early to rise is probably not as true anywhere else as it is in the budgetary process. We should copy all the good examples we can. Everything reminds us that the National Assembly must wake up to its responsibilities! There is no royal road to geometry. Related",

        "author": "Rotimi Fasan",
        "text": "By Rotimi Fasan IT\u2019S nearly half a century since the Nigerian Civil War ended, but it won\u2019t be exaggerating to say that Nigerians have since lived their lives in the trenches and under the enervating threat of yet another outbreak of civil hostilities. There are those pockets of reminders, timely warnings to those literate enough to read the signs that Nigeria perches precariously on the precipice of disaster. From the June 12 debacle, the murder of MKO Abiola, the Ogoni struggles and the periodic cataclysms of ethnic militias; the staged proclamation of sharia law in parts of the north, the death of Umar Yar\u2019Adua and the attempt to obstruct the peaceful transfer of power to his then deputy by a cabal of shadowy characters, the bloodbath that followed Goodluck Jonathan\u2019s victory in the 2011 election to the Occupy Nigeria protests of 2012, Nigeria has been the proverbial scrotum on which a combustible fly has chosen to perch. But for anyone desirous of a foretaste of what it would be like if Nigerians took up arms against one another today, the last three weeks should suffice. So let all chic adventurers and rooky warlord beware: a civil war is not a family indaba. One thing that these few weeks of confusion have brought out in bold outlines is this country\u2019s gradual transformation into a failed state. Nigeria may not have fallen apart at the seams, the patch work of diverse nationalities that the British clobbered together may still hold together, but the peace that reigns at the moment is of a type with the one that precedes destruction. It demands both attention and careful managing. And the indices of Nigeria\u2019s gradual collapse are mirrored in the severe weakening of social fabric and near total collapse of governmental strictures since the perennial energy crises that have held us bondage in the last few years returned again with renewed vigour in the last few weeks. With power supply at an all-time low even though tariffs are sky-high, with fuel as scarce as a hound\u2019s tooth and state officials out of their depth as to what to do, there is hardly any other way to describe the symptoms our nation manifests than as those of a failed state. While the energy crises persist, fuel dealers hoard products sourced from state outlets at approved rates and make a kill reselling them at black market rates. Security agents and others entrusted with the responsibility of halting such corrupt transactions turn a blind eye after their hands have been greased. Many states groan under the backlog of many months of unpaid salaries with their governors boldly calling the bluff of labour and daring those workers not satisfied with their condition of financial incapacitation to do their very worst. It would be telling a lying to say Nigerians have ever had it this bad. The grimness of the situation beggars belief even without any official or general acknowledgment of the breakdown of social order. Nigeria may not be at war yet but the picture out there tells us we are on the cusp of one. This is the dour news from the streets. These are the days of caution, of the dusk of destruction or the long night that precedes a new dawn. Either way we must choose in which direction to go. But in what direction can we go when cattle herders have abandoned their prodding staff in favour of AK47s and embarked on a campaign of mass murder? From Nsukka to Ekiti, Kogi to Agatu, the grazing field have become killing fields. One can\u2019t tell the difference between armed bandits and armed cattle herders whose cattle are themselves under the siege of rustlers that run a multimillion naira industry of crime. While the security agencies are stretched beyond limit their failure and helplessness are highlighted in equal measure by the seeming helplessness of our elected leaders to intervene meaningfully in the growing anarchy that plagues the polity. Nigeria now gives the impression of an airplane on auto-pilot, a militarised fiefdom carved under the competing control of rogue militias. The insurgents in different parts of the north-east have surely been contained to a certain degree. But their defeat is far from a complete rout. Sambisa forest, a part of Nigeria\u2019s territorial boundary, has for at least two years been under the permanent control of Boko Haram, become a more or less forbidden zone for our military. This is a record in our independent existence. Not even the Bakassi Peninsular, the flashpoint that for several years threatened to draw Nigeria into a bloody fraternal combat with Cameroon was until its formal hand over ever an occupied space. Neither oil bunkerers, pipeline vandals nor other criminals on the creeks have loosened their hold on the country\u2019s jugular. They\u2019ve continued their plunder and have taken on the security forces in an unprecedented show of might. They kill and maim anyone that stands in their way as they run, kamikaze-style, to their death. They are hardly discouraged by any deterrence offered by the state. Besieged on all sides by diverse groups and individuals including public and elected officials who have transformed their offices into positions of lucre, Nigeria totters like a drunken giant on a leg of clay. Our past haunts us. Meanwhile the Naira continues its free cascade against the dollar, sending the financial sector and the country\u2019s economy into a tailspin. Legitimate users of foreign exchange have no assurance that they will get any to run their business even as some resell what little the Central Bank could provide for profit without fear of consequences. The National Assembly this past week returned a budget long-delayed due to padding for presidential assent. But not before introducing new series of self-serving padding into a budget already burdened with criminal padding by bureaucrats that are past masters in the art of official pilfering. To whom do you turn when an armed robber keeps the key of the national vault? And President Muhammdu Buhari, as uncommunicative as ever it would take to make the effort he has so far made to bring the expected change to Nigeria appear non-existent- the president this week washed up his begging bowl and faced China in search of a $2 Billion dollars loan. Some of the projects for which the loan is intended have already been removed from the budget that awaits his assent by the National Assembly. But with the war-like situation at home, with the beleaguered country looking increasingly like a failed state, Nigerians would be hard put to make sense of the frequent presidential trips. Buhari is not the cause of the quagmire in which Nigerians have found themselves but his government must provide palpable evidence of what makes it part of the solution. Related",

The pre-Gowon success was achieved through a merit-based system from the Atlantic to the Sahara, and oil was not a factor.  Rather than make oil an addition to our agro-based success, Gowon's government made oil a curse, which destroyed agriculture and other attributes of self-determination aka fiscal federalism, which gave us the potential of making the first 10 richest nations of the 20th and 21st centuries.  Thanks to Gowon's removal of regional fiscal autonomy, we officially began our backward slide. Take your baseline of 1970; it was better than '80, and the  retrogression has continued.

        "author": "Kola Animasaun",
        "text": "By Kola Animasaun Oba Alaiyeluwa Sikiru Kayode Adetona, the Awujale of Ijebuland, has come a long way.\u00c2 He was 50 years on the throne of his fathers.\u00c2 He has spent twice the age he was when he ascended the throne. He was 25 when he was commandeered to mount the throne.\u00c2 He was doing very well in his Accountancy studies and was in no mood to cut short the studies.\u00c2 But duty called and he must obey. Sikiru was a very handsome prince and was very well loved.\u00c2 He still retained the good looks even at his old age. He would have behaved as a carefree king.\u00c2 His age would have allowed that.\u00c2 But he did not.\u00c2 He took his duties as a king seriously.\u00c2 He was at his best at the time of crisis. Sikiru is a byword for truth and he likes his people, the Ijebu people specially, the Yoruba people and Nigerians.\u00c2 No wonder people from all the corners of Nigeria gathered to honour him. There was no room for any one to snub any one at the occasion to honour Alhaji Sikiru Kayode Adetona.\u00c2 But a correspondent of The Nation saw some South-West 'gladiators' shunning one another. He even saw the deep crisis in Ogun State chapter of PDP, snubbing Governor Gbenga Daniel of Ogun State.\u00c2 Specifically he said Dimeji Bankola ignored Gbenga Daniel. The correspondent even saw Akinrogun Osoba and Ibikunle Amosu snubbed during the programme. It was the most tendentious news I have seen for a long time. Akinrogun Osoba was the immediate past Governor of Ogun State.\u00c2 He did not see any reason to snub the Governor who was a representative of the people of Ogun State.\u00c2 According to him, to snub him is to cast aspiration on the institution the governor represented. It was a laughable news.\u00c2 Except that people did not laugh.\u00c2 It was capable of causing dissension and bad blood. I met some of the good people that graced the reception.\u00c2 Some of them from the North and the East.\u00c2 They were surprised and wondered what the correspondent was up to. They categorically did not witness any rancour except the one manufactured in the imagination of the reporter. Akingrogun Osoba, a veritable reporter, was askance.\u00c2 He did not witness anything of such.\u00c2 Two natural rulers spent about six hours at the reception and did not remember any misbehavior.\u00c2 Rather there was talk of the many courses of food there were available. An Eastern Igwe was sure there were five or six \"\u201c made up of snacks thrown in. Bankole and Daniel had no animosity.\u00c2 In fact, they had animated discussions.\u00c2 Where did the reporter get this report? A tendentious report can be very bad business. Unbelievable but may be true Someone has sent me a purported schedule of salaries and allowances of Nigerian senators.\u00c2 I use \"purported\"\u009d because I could not believe that senators could earn such an outrageous salary in this age and time. The papers did do a comparism between Nigerian senators and those of the senators of United States of America. The salary of Nigerian senators is as follows: Basic salary \"\u201c N2,484,245.50; Hardship allowance @50% of basic salary \"\u201c N1,242,122.70 (I love this kind of hardship); Constituency allowance @200% of BS \"\u201c N4,968,509.00; Furniture allowance @300% of BS \"\u201c N7,452,736.50; Newspaper allowance @50 \"\u201c N1,242,122.70; Wardrobe allowance @25% \u2013 N621,061.37; Recess allowance @10% \u2013 N248,424.55; Accommodation @200% \u2013 N4,968,509.00; Utilities @30% \u2013 N828,081.83; Domestic staff @35% \u2013 N863,184.12; Entertainment @30% \u2013 N828,081.83; Personal assistance @25% \u2013 N621,061.37; Vehicle maintenance allowance @75% \u2013 N1, 863,184.12; Leave allowance @10% \u2013 N248,424.55; One off payment @300% \u2013 N7,452,736.50 (Once they get fired); Motor vehicle allowance @400% of BS \"\u201c N9,936,982.00 \"\u201c every four years; Senator's salary per month \"\u201c N2,456,647.70. Total = N29,479,749.00. *109 Senators Grand Total = N3,264,329,264.10. The paper compared the salaries of US President and Senator: Salary of US President: $250,000 per year.\u00c2 The Gross Domestic Product of the US economy: $13 Trillion per year.\u00c2 Allowance of Nigerian Senator: $1,500,000 per year.\u00c2 Grand Domestic Product of Nigeria economy: $45 billion per year. Yet the Senators want more.\u00c2 Doctors, teachers, civil servants cannot boast of N1 million a year and these guys want N30 million every month.\u00c2 The paper has told us to say no to this open looting of Nigeria. All of this cannot be true.\u00c2 That they really want to increase their quarterly allowances from N45 million to N95 million.\u00c2 If this is true, a Nigerian Senator would be earning eight times more than an American Senator at N21 million per annum and that will be three times more than the American President. Some people are saying that the Senate President earns N250 million quarterly or N83.33 million per month.\u00c2 Of course his deputy pockets N150 million per quarter or N50 million per month. Comparing earnings elsewhere, the Senate President and his deputy of this country would have earned four and six times what the UK Prime Minister earns in a year. Transform Nigeria Movement says, \"What the legislators receive \"\u00a6 is scandalously high and further upward review such as the proposed over 100 percent hike is provocative\"\u00a6 and will be the height of callousness on the part of the federal legislators.\"\u009d The group has called on the Nigerian masses to resist \"with all legitimate means available to them.\"\u009d Related",

        "author": "Donu Kogbara",
        "text": "By Donu Kogbara RIVERS State Governor, Nyesom Ezenwo Wike, is setting up an Academy in Port Harcourt, in partnership with Real Madrid, the famous Spanish football club. Wike recently travelled to Spain with his Commissioner for Sports (Boma Iyaye) and former Nigerian International player, Adokiye Amiesimaka, to discuss details with senior Real Madrid officials and globally celebrated superstars such as Cristiano Ronaldo and Sergio Ramos, the team\u2019s captain. Governor Wike in a handshake with Real Madrid star, Cristiano Ronaldo during his visit to the La Liga club. The aim of this collaboration \u2013 which has been enthusiastically applauded by Ramos and Ronaldo \u2013 is to provide top-class training opportunities to youths and to identify and nurture those who are found to possess world-class skills. \u201cWe are,\u201d says Wike, \u201cusing football as one of the key empowerment programmes for the next generation. We want to grow international stars from a tender age. We will tap from the experience and exposure of Real Madrid\u2026This project will revolutionise football in Rivers State and Nigeria.\u201d Fans often glowingly describe football as \u201cthe beautiful game\u201d, but I personally have always regarded football as extremely boring. When we were growing up in London, my brothers regularly headed off to Stamford Bridge and Highbury, wearing blue and red hats and mufflers, to watch Chelsea and Arsenal. And I thought they were completely mad! But it\u2019s not about me. The world is full of boys and men (and, by the way, females as well!) who absolutely adore that whole thing about kicking a ball around on a pitch and scoring goals (or preventing them from being scored). Furthermore, football is BIG business. It generously rewards those who excel and has transformed many seemingly ordinary guys into iconic millionaire role models and enabled them to positively impact on their families and communities. So let me congratulate Governor Wike for coming up with this inspired initiative. Some folks are complaining about this project, either because they are political enemies of Wike (and will therefore criticise everything he does!) or simply because they genuinely believe that state funds should be spent on debt clearance or on projects that will help the majority (roads, hospitals, etc). In a nutshell, the latter category of apolitical critics object to billions being spent on an elite minority who were lucky enough to be born with sporting talent. And I understand this point of view. But I don\u2019t think that it\u2019s frivolous or unfair to occasionally invest in above-average individuals. This prestigious link-up with Real Madrid is a great idea, in my opinion. It will, I hope, enhance the image of my home state. It will, I hope, generate happiness, self-confidence and wealth. It will, I hope, encourage excellence. Wike\u2019s football academy will, I hope, change lives. Bitter truth MALLAM Isah Dansallah, an associate of ex-Vice President, Atiku Abubakar, and a founding member of the ruling All Progressives Congress, APC, has abandoned APC and is now a member of the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP. Naija politicians jump ship willy nilly and cross carpet all the time, largely because of personal grievances. They usually pretend to be motivated by principle or ideological issues; but some of us are not fooled by their rhetoric! Anyway, I don\u2019t know Dansallah and am hearing about him for the first time this week and have not been following his career over the years, so don\u2019t have a clue whether he is sincere or not. But I am inclined to regard him as being more honest than the average politician because instead of claiming to regard his new party as the alpha and omega, he has drily described it as \u201ca lesser evil\u201d! Announcing his defection last Sunday, this former Chairman of Kajuru Local Council in Kaduna State and former ally of Governor Nasir El-Rufai informed the press that he could no longer tolerate the APC\u2019s \u201clack of good governance\u201d. Feelings of the masses According to Dansallah: \u201cWhat is happening in APC today is not what we bargained for. This is not why we asked people to vote out PDP. Today\u2019s players in APC do not care about the feelings of the masses\u2026I [have decided to] dump the APC\u2026because the opposition PDP is a lesser evil.\u201d \u201c\u2026The APC has metamorphosed and turned into a ghost with crises all over. The APC-led government has succeeded in subjecting Nigerians to abject poverty and has successfully divided Nigerians along religious and ethnic lines.\u201d Even if Dansallah has a hidden (and nefarious!) personal agenda, he has hit the nail squarely on the head. It\u2019s not about any one party being marvellous. It\u2019s about regarding one party as a lesser evil at particular points in time. When Dansallah was doing APC Stalwart, he was anti-PDP. Now he has changed his mind. But he\u2019s not claiming that PDP is perfect. I often stop partisan APC and PDP pals in their tracks when they try to persuade me to believe the utter fiction that the APC or PDP are blameless oases of probity and dynamism. I ask them whether they think I was born yesterday! The bitter truth is that all Nigerian parties are immensely disappointing overall; and I am pretty sure that Dansallah will soon be disgruntled in his new home! Related",

        "author": "Rotimi Fasan",
        "text": "By Rotimi Fasan ALTHOUGH much like an overdue prophesy but when it finally came, the ouster of Farida Waziri still happened rather suddenly. It was as if President Goodluck Jonathan suddenly came to the realisation that Waziri\u2019s time at the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission, EFCC, had been long due for a review and couldn\u2019t stay a moment longer. And when the announcement came, not even Waziri could be said to have anticipated it. If one report is to be believed, Mrs. Waziri\u2019s employers hadn\u2019t given her the courtesy of prior notice as she had to get the news of her ouster from members of her staff. This rude gesture is in no way as bad as the manner her predecessor in office, Nuhu Ribadu, was shoved aside and left to run for his life. In Ribadu\u2019s case, it was as if the forces ranged against him were equally bent on humiliating him as well as terminating his life. They went after him with a viciousness that could not in any way be explained rationally. Many Nigerians had then criticised the shoddy and untidy way a person originally appointed to serve the state was being treated. The criticisms fell on deaf ears and in it all, Madam Waziri didn\u2019t appear the least bothered. She sat smug and unconcerned and went about her job as if on a demolition mission. Now the seasoned whip used on Ribadu has been fetched from the rafters and the consequences don\u2019t look amusing at all. Whether Nigerians like it or not, therefore, a bad precedent has been established with the manner heads of the EFCC are hired and fired. Ultimately, it is the so-called anti-corruption war that suffers as every step taken forward is followed by three backwards. We are back, it seems, to the pre-Waziri era with the appointment of Ibrahim Lamorde as her successor. But it remains to be seen just how much has changed since Lamorde who had been Ribadu\u2019s right hand man and had, in fact, acted as EFCC chair in the immediate aftermath of Ribadu\u2019s removal- it would be interesting to know how much of the Ribadu-era fire is still left in him. One cannot help speculating in this manner because much of what Ribadu did in his time became anathema after Waziri took over. The entire goal on the part of the new team was to keep a wide berth between their approach and that of Ribadu. No doubt Ribadu made a lot mistakes but they didn\u2019t look like the picture created by the new power house at the EFCC after he was replaced. A lot was said about \u2018due process\u2019 and \u2018rule of law\u2019 but in the end Waziri would face the same criticisms levelled against Ribadu. In the last few months she would be criticised for violating the rights of Nigerians that came under EFCC investigation and arrest. Yet, her activities during the last few months appeared directed at increasing the tempo and span of the fight against corruption. Which makes it all the more difficult knowing why she had to be shoved out in the manner she was. At what point and for which reason did her work become unsatisfactory to her employers? What exactly could have prompted her removal more than a year before the end of her tenure? At her appointment in May 2008 the impression was created that government wanted to make the activities of the chief executive of the EFCC stable by making their appointment a tenured term of five years. This does not look like the case anymore. What really happened to change matters? Can the sudden removal of the top executives of the EFCC at the point when they appear to be doing the work for which they had been appointed be healthy for smooth running of the body? This surely cannot be answered in the affirmative. The point, however, is that until the element of uncertainty is removed from the manner EFCC chiefs are appointed and fired, the quality of their work cannot be guaranteed and Nigerians would be at a loss knowing what these executives did right or wrong. The role of their employers or others they have to work with would always appear to cast a dark and unwanted shadow over the position of the EFCC chair. For one, a clear line would need to be drawn in terms of how executives of the EFCC are to relate with the minister that oversees their office, specifically the Minister of Justice and Attorney General of the Federation. The last EFCC chairs at some point or another had frosty relations with persons that occupied that position. Michael Aondoakaa had nothing good to say about the EFCC under Ribadu. He sought and exercised overbearing influence over the EFCC chair and he would not be satisfied until the latter was shoved out of office. For a while he seemed to enjoy better relationship with Waziri. But this too would end suddenly despite Waziri\u2019s more pliant and cooperative attitude. The truth is that Aondoakaa couldn\u2019t see himself in any position except where he is the one exercising unaccountable power. The apparent accord between him and Waziri would end on a sour note. The situation didn\u2019t improve between Mohammed Adoke, Aondoakaa\u2019s successor, and Waziri. Their relationship was at best cold and it couldn\u2019t be clear why this was so. But it was clear that Waziri didn\u2019t enjoy the confidence of the minister. It may not be really as rewarding to speculate on the actual reasons for their disagreement as that the disagreement portrays the government as unserious about fighting corruption where the top people involved in the fight continued to work at cross purposes. Certainly, someone somewhere didn\u2019t see the war against corruption as one that could be won by government. And so the rigmarole continues and we must wonder if the appointment of Lamorde would be for the best. We\u2019ll have to wait and hope that matters turn out right. Yet there is every need to worry in the face of what looks like failure on the part of government to take the fight against corruption beyond the level of rhetoric. There is too much talk at the expense of action. Would Lamorde take us beyond this? One guess is as good as another. Related",

His country considered it necessary to bring him\u00c2 to explain to the public how he made the decision to take the country to a war in search of Saddam Hussein's non-existent weapons of mass destruction; a Quixotic military expedition that cost the country thousands of troops. I compared this with an attempt by the House of Representatives in 2008 to bring former President Olusegun Obasanjo to explain exactly how much he spent on the electric power projects without any sign of improvement in our power supply. Obasanjo managed to raise enough emotional dust before he submitted a terse reply that left more questions than answers. His supporters berated the National Assembly for the invitation, which they termed an attempt to humiliate the former president. Obasanjo was not the first former ruler to refuse to appear before panels to account for their actions while office. Former military heads of state, retired Major General Muhammadu Buhari, General Ibrahim Babangida and General Abdulsalami Abubakar, also refused to appear before the Justice Chukwudifu Oputa Panel, which investigated human rights violations during the military era. The former President, Obasanjo, had inaugurated this Panel on June 14th, 1999 shortly after he was sworn in. Nine years later, he refused to appear at a House Committee hearing. That is Nigeria for you, where hypocrites are rewarded by being invited to rule Nigeria over and again. Coming back to the present, my sadness swells when I see the way President Umaru Musa Yar'Adua has reduced the powers of the federation entrusted to him to a personal toy which he would never give up even temporarily to enable Nigeria carry on. The famous Section 145 of the Constitution says: \"Whenever the President transmits to the President of the Senate and the Speaker of the House of Representatives a written declaration that he is proceeding on a vacation or that he is otherwise unable to discharge the functions of his office, until he transmits to them a written declaration to the contrary, such functions shall be discharged by the Vice President as Acting President\"\u009d. The drafters of this Section never imagined that a president going away for more than two months could refuse to carry out this injunction. Well, Yar' Adua has proved once again that in Nigeria, anything is possible. Yar' Adua has decided to hold Nigeria to ransom because he does not know the implication of the sacred mandate he was given. He thinks it is his personal property. Meanwhile, his apologists are saying there is no vacuum. The Governor of the Central Bank, Malam Lamido Sanusi, claims that the President's absence has not affected the economy in any way. Fine! Then let's get rid of the President! If the economy continues to perform despite the president's absence and medical woes; and if the Executive Branch is functioning perfectly without its Chairman, then we don't need him. We need a President who, when he speaks or acts the whole system (such as the stock exchange) will react immediately. Telling us that the President's absence has not impacted on the economy is like saying that a headless body is still alive. There, definitely, is a big vacuum occasioned by Yar' Adua's refusal to write the National Assembly in order allow Vice President Goodluck Jonathan to take full charge of the affairs of the nation until (and if) he comes back from \"medical vacation\"\u009d. It has stalled many programmes, including the post-amnesty deal that led to the cessation of the Niger Delta rebellion. That vacuum was responsible for the out-gone Chief Justice of Nigeria swearing in the in-coming one. If the Vice President had full acting powers of the President he would have performed that function. The Vice President is still performing only in his limited capacity as a vice president. In that capacity, he cannot sign the 2010 budget when passed. He cannot engage the National Assembly for compromise on the budget should the need arise. Even the National Assembly's legislative agenda has been disrupted. Rather than focus attention on passing the budget and completing the electoral reform and constitutional amendment process, the National Assembly is now engaged in receiving concerned Nigerians and begging Yar'Adua to send the letter empowering his Deputy to take charge. What is going on is being tagged in the outside world as a \"Nigerian crisis\"\u009d. A country that is leaderless for more than two months is in a catastrophe. In the days past, this is a perfect trigger for a military intervention. That the military has refrained from taking this opportunity to return to power is a measure of the growth of our civic culture. But surely, this situation cannot continue indefinitely. Whenever there is a vacuum something rushes in to fill it. The visit of former Nigeria leaders, such as Alhaji Shehu Shagari (who stood in place of General Yakubu Gowon as leader of the delegation), Dr. Alex Ekwueme, Chief Ernest Shonekan, General Yakubu Danjuma, former Chief Justices of the Federation, Muhammadu Uwais, Alfa Belgore and Legbo Kutigi, among the others, to the National Assembly to submit a demand for Yar'Adua to hand over to his Deputy was an important omen. Even though Obasanjo contributed to this problem, he too has called for Yar\u2019 Adua to obey the Constitution and toe the path of honour. World leaders are worried because they know the implications of a headless government especially in volatile country like Nigeria . It is now in Yar'Adua's personal interest to write that letter. When the world saw that General Sani Abacha and Chief MKO Abiola had become Nigeria 's incurable headache, a special \"Panadol\"\u009d was administered. It could happen again. Related",

        "author": "Helen Ovbiagele",
        "text": "By Helen Ovbiagele After receiving a thunderous applause for the very inspiring/moving sermon he had just delivered, it was time for this man of God to bless members of his church for the new year. \u201cNow, steady yourself and concentrate on the release of these blessings. Catch them as they come, and as they relate to your situation. Are you ready?\u201d \u201cYeah, Pastor! Ride on Pastor!\u201d yelled back the teeming young people in the congregation. In an authoritative and convincing manner, he began to pray; favour, vehicles, houses, good health, good jobs, lucrative contracts, holiness, open doors, etc. into their lives amidst thunderous \u2018Amen!\u2019 \u201cYour miracle is on the way! Don\u2019t fail to come give the Lord glory in your testimonies soon,\u201d he concluded. With God, of course everything is possible, but as I reflected on those prayer points later, I wondered how many of them, especially the visible ones, would come true for the majority of the people in their life time; given their current circumstances, and the conditions that prevail in our dear country. The first that came to mind was \u2018housing\u2019. Just how realistic is it for the majority of Nigerians, the masses especially, to own their own houses? The chances are very slim. Having a roof which is actually yours over your head, is the ardent desire of many human beings. It is a global desire which has been in man since the world was created. Land and houses are so important to us in this country that disputes about them, form the bulk of cases in the courts at any given time, and some people are prepared to kill if their ownership is challenged in any way. Shelter is part of human rights. Any government worth its salt would make it a priority to make owning their own houses easy for the citizens. One may not agree with every decision that General Obasanjo made while he was president of this country, but deciding that the houses in Satellite Town Lagos, which government had built for the use of members of the 1978/79 Constituent Assembly, be balloted for sale at very affordable costs to federal civil servants according to their respective States of origin, was quite laudable. I know a few families who, to this day, are still grateful to him for that gesture, because they had a house of their own in Lagos to retire to. The category of house (4 bedroom, three bedroom, and two bedroom) you balloted for depended on your salary grade, and a mortgage was arranged with the Federal Mortgage Bank, so that payments were easily affordable.. This made it possible for low salaried civil servants \u2013 clerks, drivers, cleaners, messengers, etc. to own their own houses; a thing they never dreamed possible. Some sold theirs and relocated to their home towns, while some let theirs out, and returned home. Whatever the case, the house became part of the deal for a better retirement for them, particularly these days when the government owes many of them, their monthly pensions. Some have not yet been paid their benefits, many years after they retired. The sales of the Festac Village houses came before those of the Satellite Town houses, but it was open to all citizens, and high prices meant that the detached houses and the duplexes went to the rich, while the low earners got the \u2018republic\u2019 flats. Still, this was some relief to many. Since then, various state governments have embarked on housing projects, but these houses get priced out of the reach of the poor. The private developers, with an eye on huge profits, are building for the very rich. Some of their houses have been priced so high that buyers can not be readily found. Developers say that high costs of land in choice places, and the rocketing prices of building materials are responsible for high prices. Even if you buy a piece of land, it may take you several years, or even forever to erect a house there because of the high costs of building materials. So, your dream of being a house-owner may not be possible unless the government takes serious steps to bring down the costs of cement and other building materials, which we\u2019re told are expensive because of high costs of production and importation. High costs of building a house means high rents for tenants; and that\u2019s in a country where unemployment is high! I was perplexed when I read \u2018Glut, idle plants hit cement industry. Dangote lays off 2,500 workers at Gboko cement plant; Lafarge WAPCO cement contemplates downsizing\u2019. It\u2019s a pity that such a large number of people had to lose their jobs, but shouldn\u2019t the glut lead to a drastic fall in the cost of cement? \u2018Hopes of the nations\u2019 industrial re-birth, through cement manufacturing sub-sector, may have dimmed, as lingering product glut, occasioned by unbridled importation of the commodity and high cost operations have assailed local production lines,\u2019 says the news item. \u2018Already, the Gboko, Benue State plant of Dangote Cement PLC, has shut down, with over 2,500 workers temporarily laid off, as the company awaits improved business environment to re-commence operations. Other plants that may soon shut down their production lines are Obajana and Ibeshe in Kogi and Ogun States respectively, belonging to Dangote Cement, and Lafarge WAPCO Cement Nigeria Plc\u2019s Ewekoro II in Ogun State.\u2019 The piece said that the President of Cement Manufacturers Association of Nigeria (CMAN), Joseph Makoju,was reported to have said, \u2018In the last six months we manufacturers of cement in Nigeria have been storing tonnes of cement and clinkers in our warehouses since there has been significant drop in demand of cement and no market to sell our products.\u2019 He said the association was not responsible for the artificial increase in cement prices in the country, adding that in the past four years, cement manufacturers have not increased the x-factory price of cement. Oh dear! This is all very confusing for the layman, isn\u2019t it? On the one hand, there\u2019s is so much cement materials stored away because there are no buyers, and workers are being temporarily laid off; on the other hand, the prices of cement have soared because of seeming scarcity! This government should seriously address the scarcity and soaring prices, and bring the costs of cement and other building materials down immediately, even if it means lowering drastically, the costs of importation. The fact that our rulers can afford to build houses effortlessly, doesn\u2019t mean that they should remain insensitive to the nightmare the rest of us are facing. Related",

        "author": "Bisi Lawrence",
        "text": "By Bisi Lawrence *let them burn As ugly a human undertaking as any kind of war is, none is as gruesome as a fratricidal conflict and that describes every civil war. Our three year-long experience could not have been devoid of some shameful acts on both sides, soured as it was by ethnic prejudices. But the mature and cultured mind takes it all in and allows the finest touch of the human spirit to mellow it down. That is the quality of the mentality that one would expect in an accomplished writer like Chinua Achebe. One ought to be disappointed, but not quite. For one thing, he had never hidden his dislike for Chief Obafemi Awolowo, who is deeply revered by many people, especially among the chiefs own kinsfolk, the Yoruba people. Chinua Achebe could not even abide the outpouring of adulatory tributes from them immediately after the passing of the man they love to honour as \u201cThe Sage\u201d. He opened up with a diatribe that left many people, even among the Igbo, his own people, speechless. He titled this sludge of his, \u201cThe Apostasy of Awolowo\u201d. It was supposed to represent a note of resentment against, or rejection of the genuine expressions of regret and sorrow at the death of a nationalist many people sincerely believed had contributed to the making of Nigeria as a nation, not least among them even several Igbo people on whose behalf Achebe posed to vilify such an illustrious figure. Indeed, it contrasted sharply with the tribute of, in my book, one of the greatest Nigerians \u2014if not the greatest ever\u2014 Nnamdi Azikiwe, himsel f of Igbo extraction. I was myself indignant enough to react with a denunciation of Achebe, who had been my boss when I was a Senior Features Producer in Radio Nigeria, Enugu. He was the Regional Controller, having served earlier in Lagos as the Head of Talks, around the time he authored the highly acclaimed, \u201cThings Fall Apart\u201d. He was a quietly assertive man who enjoyed every bit of humour even when he seemed to be the butt of it. But he found it easy, it seemed to me, to be somewhat swayed away from being very fair, though fearlessly so, for his nature was apparently anchored on a compulsory impulse to be forthright in all circumstances. He does not seem to have changed much \u2014the same human decent being, with the same purely human failings. Even if we dismissed the adage that \u201call is fair in love and war\u201d, for its triteness, we would still have to admit the veracity of its natural impact on the actions and reaction of homo sapiens. In no historical record of warfare would be found the incidence of an army that was fed by the foes against whom it was ranged in open conflict. It has never happened. Right from the time of the Punic Wars in the Thirteenth Century, the opportunity of a blockade has never been missed in warfare as a means of disrupting supplies whether of material or sustenance. At other times, direct aggression would even be employed to break the line of supply, as in the case of Dresden in World War II. The dreadful ploy is always a loathsome episode in the over-all ugly conditions of war. The evidence of its horror must have etched an indelible image on some delicate minds indeed, especially the sight of those children who were reduced to mere skeletons with distended bellies. It would have given rise to feelings of hatred. But, ov er time, it should not nurture notions of hate. A second consideration of Achebe\u2019s proffered reason for Awolowo to adopt a \u201cpolicy of starvation\u201d against the Biafrans during the war shows the contradictions in the presumption that it was in line with the ambitions of the Yoruba politician to capture the entire country in a nation-wide bid for the presidency. How could that be achieved without the indispensable support of the Igbo people who, form a sizeable proportion of the country\u2019s population? Or could Awo have been so naive as to envision a host of those who had survived his starvation onslaught forming a long queue to vote for\u2019 him in an election? That could not be. Fortunately, the late \u201cSage\u201d was opportuned to defend his actions while he was still alive. Many have found his explanations acceptable, even if not palatable; but neither is any aspect of war, nor the expressions of even a forthright heart horribly scarred by its ravages. Suddenly, the young lady was in full flight. She had dared an attempt to cross the road in a fairly crowded enclave when the Okada appeared swinging from one side of the road to the other, hardly caring for the pedestrians who quickly skipped out of its way. But our young \u201cmiss\u201d noticed it almost too late. And as it zoomed towards her, she took one quick look and spread her wings. It was a smooth flight. She escaped from the awful machine \u2026. but the landing was straight into the gutter. There she floundered, emitting a shriek of anguish that gripped the sympathy of all around. The rider of the Okada tried to escape, but the crowd barred his way and descended on him with fierce blows. They might have lynched him but he fought back and made good his escape to a distance, from where he flung imprecations on his assailants. The young lady picked herself up from the gutter with a little help from crowd who were more interested in deciding the fate of the hapless rider waiting for the opportunity to reclaim his slightly damaged machine to resume his journey. If you live n Lagos, you might have witnessed one or two versions of that incident every other week. Or even more frequently. The daredevil riders operated outside and beyond the law. They would ride against one-way streets; they would ignore traffic lights; they would carry two or more passengers (including pregnant women, or women with babies strapped on their backs), in stead of one permitted by law, on the pillion seats; they would blare their horns with studied provocation; they would refuse to use crash helmets as specified by the law; they would quarrel with their passengers and fellow-Okada operators, and motorists, and pedestrians\u2014everybody. And, with all this and other forms of nuisance manifestations, they would cause constant disruptions in the traffic. I was so happy I could almost call a party when the new traffic laws keeping them in their place were promulgated. But I was quickly made sober by thoughts of how well the regulations stipulated by the laws would be enforced. There had been no adequate legal restraints on this commercially operated kind of public transport in Lagos, as it would appear, but there have always been traffic regulations in place which the riders flouted with impunity. The policemen simply ignored them or \u201caccommodated\u201d them. So, making laws was one thing, but enforcing them simply had to supplement the legislation. But now my misgivings have received a pleasant shock with the \u201cdemolition\u201d by fire, of several hundreds of the awful machines caught in erring situations recently in Lagos. That should indicate the level of seriousness of the authorities. But there is one more measure that they should adopt, and that is the control of the number of the tricycles (Marwa) and the commercial motor-cycles in each zone where they still operate. The commercial vehicular population of the city needs to be controlled anyway, in an organized municipal system. Even in the colonial days when there was less threat of traffic chaos on the roads, the number of taxis was controlled within Lagos. It somehow gave way to the untidy situation where the urban roadways became choked with all sorts of commercial vehicles. The vital services they render were thus stifled when traffic gridlock resulted in clogged-up movement. The limited relief from the nuisance of the Okada phenomenon through the new Lagos traffic regulations deserve commendation. Time out Related",

        "text": "*Oshiomhole: APC chairman, aladima: Buhari\u2019s former pal now rebel leader and Buhari: Party leader yet to speak on the crisis By Rotimi Fasan THE nPDP faction of the different groups that constituted the All Progressives Congress, APC, contraption finally made good its threat to \u2018leave\u2019 the party to seek its own fortune elsewhere several days ago. This faction of the APC has long been aggrieved. Indeed from the first few weeks if not days of APC\u2019s victory over the PDP in 2015, the nPDP had conveyed the impression of being outsiders in a political house several groups claimed to have erected. The thin rope that held the nPDP to the mainstream of the APC broke when the faction announced Buba Galadima, an erstwhile ally of President Muhammadu Buhari, as chair of the Reformed All Progressives Congress, the name by which the new group within the APC wishes to be known. Technically, the R-APC is still a part of the APC family as it is yet to make a complete break with the party. A few reasons could account for this among which may be the fact that the R-APC is yet fishing for a convenient place to berth its political ship. The group is still engaged in negotiations with other political groups, including the Peoples Democratic Party from where it broke away in 2015. Leading members of the R-APC include the two legs that control the Nigerian legislative assembly, namely the President of the Senate, Bukola Saraki, and the Speaker of the House of Representatives, Yakubu Dogara. But in spite of its control of both the executive and legislative arms of government, the APC has operated like a house divided against itself. Except for very brief spells of cordiality the relationship between these units of the APC has been marked by mutual suspicion if not downright hostility and dislike. Both arms of government and indeed the leadership of the APC have functioned at cross-purposes. Advantages that should naturally accrue to a party in control of both the executive and the legislature are often far from the APC. There is neither cordiality nor goodwill in the treatment accorded bills sponsored from even members of the party. Avoidable obstacles are thrown in the way of bills including those meant for national appropriation to the extent that the passage of bills is delayed and the bills are left to languish on the floor of the National Assembly for many months on end due to disagreement among members of the APC. A mere breach, a sore that could have been better handled in the early days of the party was allowed to fester until it became a gangrenous wound that now demands complete amputation of the diseased parts. The marriage of convenience that resulted in the formation of the APC exhibited signs of distress right from the moment the party succeeded in pushing the PDP out of power. It started within a month of its electoral triumph over disagreement about the leadership of the National Assembly. While the party leadership thought it had the matter all settled and was sure of those it wanted to lead the party in the legislature, a rebel arm led by Bukola Saraki and Yakubu Dogara, both members of the nPDP, ambushed the APC leadership and took over the leadership of the legislature in cahoots with its former PDP ally in the National Assembly. It was an early warning sign to the APC leadership that its nPDP counterparts were not ready to tow party line much less play second fiddle to the other factions that made up the APC. Things would take a turn for the worse right from that time as Saraki would be accused of false asset declaration and brought before the Code of Conduct Tribunal. Even at this time, the issue could still have been resolved. But President Buhari in a false show of neutrality stood aside, as he sometimes still does, watching as the party that brought him to power fell apart. He would not try to put things right in the party until he realised he would need this same vehicle for his re-election. By this time matters had got to a head. Only days ago, Bukola Saraki was handed a reprieve by the Supreme Court that discharged and acquitted him of all charges pertaining to false asset declaration. Coming at this time, he is parting ways with the APC leadership, the Supreme Court decision is a boon that will strengthen the hand of the R-APC in their fight with the APC leadership. This is without prejudice to the fact that Bukola Saraki, arrow head of the R-APC, still has other charges hanging around his neck. But his discharge and acquittal by the Supreme Court could only strengthen the impression he and his supporters had given that extant charges against him, like the ones he\u2019s just been relived of, were trumped-up allegations meant to hobble him politically. Like a house built with spittle which the Yoruba say will be washed away by dew, the contraption that was the APC appears to be falling apart. Having won the electoral war the party seems lost as to how to win and sustain the electoral peace. While nobody can tell what the actual impact of the R-APC move may yet have on the APC, the mainstream party appears strong to weather the rising storm, no thanks to the absence of any viable opposition from the PDP or any other party out there. The R-APC is itself hobbled by its members\u2019 past history of serial defection. Their place in the APC is made more precarious by the fact that they do not appear trustworthy to potential allies that may be hard put to understand their members\u2019 penchant to give allegiance to none but themselves. Their role in the electoral defeat of the PDP is another factor that could affect their talks with the PDP and other groups. And although they call themselves reformed this claim is nothing but an unconvincing way to distinguish themselves from the mainstream elements of the APC. The R-APC is anything but reformed. Nothing sets them apart from their estranged comrades in the APC leadership. The losers in this self-serving game of shifting labels are the Nigerian people who have few options available to choose from. From the last election that threw up both Goodluck Jonathan and Muhammadu Buhari, Nigerians have been left with hardly any credible choice of leaders or political parties. It\u2019s been a case of \u2018how-for-do\u2019 in almost the entire history of this country. We have had to settle for the available where the desirable has been elusive or nowhere to be found. The Nigerian political firmament has been devoid of stars bright enough to lead us out of the gloom of poor governance signposted by corruption, ethnic and sectarian interests that have turned the country into a bloody field of mass murders.

        "author": "Obi Nwakanma",
        "text": "By Obi Nwakanma Nigeria is a real theatre of the absurd. As a matter of fact, daily life, and public conduct in Nigeria would have given far greater material to the work of Beckett and Pinter \u2013 those great modernists of English theater whose absurdist plays gave insight into both the futility and the meaningless horror of daily life in post war Europe whose moral core had all but collapsed. Nigeria is that sort of place where an elected government could announce without blinking an eye; without a sense of embarrassment or shame, that it had expended N700 million of the public\u2019s money to acquire property for a Sultan, a private citizen, never mind the title. To add to this absurdity, the sultan may probably already have a house of his own in this city. And that is exactly what has happened: the scandalous revelation just last week by the Sokoto state government under Tambuwal, former Speaker of the House of Representatives, who switched parties from the PDP to the APC (well Nigerian politicians switch parties like whores switch clients) on a huff, contested to be governor of Sokoto, and you\u2019d think that he\u2019d have acquired the sagacity necessary for public leadership under a democracy anchored on the rule of law. One might in fact expect of Tambuwal, given his experience as a legislator, and as the elected governor, to assert a different kind of moral fibre on behalf of the people, and refuse assent to any proposal aimed at appropriating public resources to fund an illegal mandate, even if the Sokoto legislature had proposed and passed that appropriation. The Sokoto state government under Tambuwal\u2019s administration nevertheless mucked up the entire meaning of public leadership because it has, in being part of this scandalous transaction, betrayed the people who elected him, and betrayed his oath as a democratically elected governor to serve the people and not just some special interests. Let me place all this in context for those who may not know what the bejesus I\u2019m talking about: the \u201csocial media\u201d lit up with public angst last week on learning that the Sokoto state government had authorized and expended N700 million to acquire property for the Sultan in Abuja. As the facts now indicate, sometime around November 2016, the Secretary to the government of Sokoto state, Professor Bashir Garba raised a memo to wit: \u201cYour Excellency is aware of the expressed need received from the Sultanate council to have a guest house in Abuja to defray the government of accommodation and ensure convenience of his eminence and entourage while in Abuja for sundry official engagement\u201d. Bashir Garba sought the leave of the governor to approve the purchase of such a house \u201cbefitting\u201d the Sultan and the \u201cSultanate council,\u201d which in due course was approved, apparently with scant recourse or even regard either to legal opinion or to public opinion. In the upshot, a house \u2013 rambling, disproportionate to the necessity, and disregarding the reality of the Sokoto economy and situation was procured for the use of the Sultan and his \u201cSultanate council\u201d on Ontario drive in Maitama, Abuja. The revelation of this transaction has raised enormous flack by its numerous critics. In quick response to these critics of the Sokoto government, the governor\u2019s Director of Public Affairs, Mr. Imam, published a procedural memo, detailing the nature of the transaction, and in it made the following claims: the Sultan serves an important function for Sokoto, and operates at two levels, one as a traditional ruler, and the other as religious leader of the Muslims. An old law in Sokoto provides for a dual funding between the local councils and the state government for the office of the Sultan. Because of the expanded role of the Sultan of Sokoto, not only as leader of the Muslims, but as some kind of go-to person for NGOs, foreign governments and other international agencies, the Sultan requires a befitting lodging in Abuja, where he normally stays in an hotel. And because the Sultan does not travel alone, his hotel lodging expenditure has become just that case of, well, shall we say, the wise penny and foolish pound. As a matter of fact, lending some support to Mr. Imam and the Sokoto government last week in an essay, the columnist Uche Ezechukwu in the very conservative Authority newspaper writes that the social media ruckus over the N700 million house for the Sultan was, \u201cmuch ado about nothing\u201d and a \u201ccelebration of inanities and habitual slander\u201d against the governor, and the government of Sokoto, \u201cfor daring, in the view of our know-all social media patrons, to commit the abomination of hauling a whopping sum of N700 million of its scarce resources to buy and furnish a posh home at the federal capital in Abuja for the Sultan. All through last week, some social media commentators exhibited their overflowing love for the long-suffering and deprived people of Sokoto State by excoriating the huge injustice which their governor, Aminu Waziri Tambuwal had meted out to them through his huge \u2018misplacement of priority\u2019 by daring to dole out the money, which, in the thinking of these unsolicited do-gooders, would have been better deployed towards other welfare and social activities, instead of a house for the Sultan at the nation\u2019s capital\u2026.Such naysayers would never understand how the promotion and upholding the prestige of the Sultanate is the first and most important duty of every Sokoto person or government. Providing a befitting base at Abuja for the Sultanate is a dramatization of that important duty.\u201d Ezechukwu\u2019s view is certainly of a distinct minority, but it is also easy to see it for what it is: a \u201ccommuniqua\u201d \u2013 with the alleged insinuation of pay-per-view opinion journalism which lacks the subtlest sense in retailing its own \u201cinanity.\u201d The Sultan as a matter of fact has no business in Abuja, except as a private citizen, and he has the resources to build his own private residence in Abuja. Secondly, since the Sultan is the leader of the Muslims both in Sokoto and nation-wide, perhaps the Ummah might raise the money to build an official residence. Sokoto is a multi-religious state, made up of Muslims, Christians, and animists, and the Nigerian constitution forbids the promotion of one faith over the other by any government. Thirdly, if the Sokoto government was feeling that generous, perhaps it should make arrangements for the Sultan and his retinue to stay from time to time in the equally sprawling Sokoto House \u2013 the official residence of the Sokoto government in Abuja \u2013 gratis. Procuring a N700 million house for the use of the Sultan is a scandalous misuse of public fund \u2013 in a state which records one of the lowest school enrollments nationwide and whose public education infrastructure where it exists is primitive; a state which has no well-funded program for its population of impoverished people, particularly very illiterate youth; and poor street kids who roam the streets begging alms rather than receiving training that would free them, and make them sovereign over the decaying edifice of \u201ctradition\u201d; where infant and maternal mortality is one of the highest in the world because of inadequate healthcare. This is the sum of the tragedy: Tambuwal\u2019s government continues the pattern of robbing the poor of the North to pay the indolent and entitled rich of the North, which is why the North is so very backward: it reproduces poverty by creating social pyramids rather than horizontal citizenship. It is really absurd and it is inexcusable, this house bought for the Sultan in Abuja with the public\u2019s money. Related",

        "author": "Obi Nwakanma",
        "text": "By Obi Nwakanma The legislature is the weakest link in Nigeria's current democratic experiment. Its weakness derives in part from the many years of military rule which disorganized the rules of conduct as well as the values of debate necessary for a robust parliamentary culture. The effect of this is that from the local government councils to the various state assemblies to the National Assembly, we have sent, or we have allowed to emerge, some of the most curious characters that any political culture could throw up. There is certainly a difference between \"representative democracy\"\u009d and \"participatory democracy\"\u009d and Nigeria's experience since the end of the military regimes has been far more of the former. The sum of it is that the real electorate is absent from the political process. The politicians \"\u201c and it is a term I use carefully, because true \"politicians\"\u009d are far more cautious and far more in tune with real people and the real issues affecting their societies \"\u201c but those who currently parade themselves as the political actors and political leaders of the nation live far out of the realm and reality of Nigerian daily life. It would seem only appropriate to say that what is going on in the name of democracy in Nigeria currently is but farce. Nigerians hinge their hopes on electoral reforms. Electoral reforms will enfranchise them, and give them the legitimate tool to participate \"\u201c that is to vote their true choices in elections and to make certain that the vote they cast is counted. The vote is the people's only tool in determining the quality of representation they get in the men and women they send out to what ought to be an August assembly of the peers, the best that Nigeria can afford. The vote would also permit the Nigerian electorate to exercise the kind of civic oversight necessary for the growth of democracy and the politics of issues rather than the kind of mercenary mindset that currently afflicts the National and state Assemblies. So far, as we take a measure of the men and women who exercise our legislative mandate, one sees only political lilliputans \"\u201c bar just a handful \u2013 whose conducts lack the depth, dignity, integrity and the learning required of a law-making body. Of course, the work of the assemblies are not only to make laws but to also ensure that there is the rule of law. They check the excesses of the executive branch and keep them honest. An alert parliament would naturally make sure that all rules of appropriation are obeyed by the executive and that there is hardly any leak that might give cause to corruption. But a weak, corrupt and subservient \"\u201c or what we might call rubber-stamp or sleeping parliament is a recipe for political disaster. The unsatisfying conduct of politics, and the terrible performance of the executive arm of the government since 1999 can be fully attributed to this weak link to power \"\u201c the legislative branch. They have failed to provide solid coverage to the judiciary, and they have basically allowed the presidency and the gubernatorate to assume so much power that it often seems that what we have created is the \"monarchy\"\u009d and its minion, rather than democratically elected representatives . The reason for the weakness of the Nigerian government and the failure of its legislature under this \"democracy\"\u009d was made quite evident in the past two weeks following the public ruckus in the Federal House of Representatives involving the speaker, Mr. Dimeji Bankole and certain members of the House, and in the rather insensitive discussion in the Senate to raise members pay. Let us first examine the Senate proposal for a brief second: the members of the National Assembly are paid a fixed annual basic salary and allowances far in excess of the general income profile of the nation where the highest paid Nigerian professors, doctors, and other professionals earn less than N1 million in a year. Nigerian senators for instance take home in excess of N11 million as basic salary and a total of N152 million when all kinds of inscrutable allowances are added. It all comes to about $1.11 million when these irregular allowances are calculated. This is in a country where the police Superintendent earns about N50, 000 (about $350 per month) To understand the perfidy of the Senate proposal, it is prudent to compare the take home entitlements of Nigerian politicians with, say American public servants. The highest paid public servant in the United States, the US president, earns a total package of $400,000, while the Vice President, who also serves as President of the Senate, earns $227, 300 in total package. The Speaker of the US House of Representatives earns $223,500, while the Senate and House minority and majority leaders all earn $193, 000 as do US ministers or Cabinet Secretaries. An American senator earns $174, 000. What is wrong with this picture? To put it simply, a Nigerian senator earns more than the president of the richest country in the world, and indeed, more than the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom. These are rich industrial nations where public service is exactly what it is: a call to service not a call to loot. Indeed this year, the US Senate and House, in deference to the economic downturn and in solidarity with Americans who are losing jobs and having paycuts, and who are also not receiving pay rises, voted against a pay rise for themselves. You may accuse the American politician of many things, but you'd have to give it to them, that they are sensitive to the public image of their nation as well as their own public image as servants of the nation. The salary and allowances profiles of Nigerian politicians ought to give us a cause to pause. The plans to hike it in fact ought to infuriate us so much that Nigerians should picket the National Assembly and the various State Houses of Assembly in a public protest. The problem however is that these Parliamentary buildings are gated and distant; they lack a certain sense of public accessibility. They are remote because they were not really conceived to be the parliaments of the people but the House of cads and the stomping ground of oligarchists, oligopolists, and fair weather politicians. Nigerians must nevertheless write in to their senators, representatives and Assemblymen to basically rethink the move to increase the already bloated allowance of politicians, and in actual fact, to do a thorough rethink of the pay acruable to public officials, including plugging such holes by which officials like state governors and the president receive excess, unaccounted funds through what they call the \"security vote.\"\u009d It has become obvious that this article of accounting in public expenditure, first introduced under military rule, has no place in our current reality. Governors of states should henceforth stop allocating \"security votes\"\u009d to themselves \"\u201c which has become euphemism for unaccounted and unaccountable public funds. This must have to stop. But I guess it will stop only when we have a robust parliament. Related",

        "author": "Muyiwa Adetiba",
        "text": "By Muyiwa Adetiba People who know Ogbeni Rauf Aregbesola, the Governor of Osun State say he is a brilliant man. I have never met him despite my close ties with Osun State but have watched him on the soap box a couple of times and I can attest to his oratorical prowess. But there was nothing brilliant or oratorical about him last week when he appeared on TV trying to defend his inability to pay salaries. He looked incoherent and pathetic. He stammered and almost choked on his words when he talked about how he transformed the sleepy, rural State he met some six years ago. He talked about the various empowerment programmes he embarked upon and the lasting impact they would eventually have on the State and how he should be remembered for those good deeds of the past. Aregbosola You now wonder with what has since happened, if the empowerment programmes were mere populist gestures or real transformations. Given his socialist background, what I suspect he did was to collect hand-outs from the Federal purse and simply distributed them to his various welfare programmes. A real transformation should have concentrated on teaching people how to fish and be self- reliant. In any case, nothing justifies not paying workers\u2019 salaries. Unfortunately, Osun State is just one of 22 States that are unable to pay salaries and Aregbesola is one of the many Governors that have mismanaged their States\u2019 economy. It is disingenuous to blame the Federal Government for your inability to pay your workers. I am not going to quote the clich\u00e9 that \u2018workers deserve their pay\u2019 here because that is really part of the problem. Many of the workers don\u2019t deserve to be on the pay roll. For years, people had been crying about the unviability of many of our States but our politicians and tribal leaders refused to listen. They load the pay roll with relatives and ego massaging cronies. A P.A has a P.A and a secretary who in turn will have his own P.A. and secretary. Many of these people have nothing to do besides increasing State bureaucracy and slowing down the system. Then there are \u2018civil servants\u2019 who just wait for pay day without lifting a finger all month. Having said this, if you are \u2018smart\u2019 enough to employ all manner of people, then you should pay them. Meanwhile, there is no difference between the carriage of a state Governor whose monthly allocation is three billion Naira and another Governor who collects 15 billion Naira monthly. All, and I mean all, our Governors lead lifestyles that have no correlation with their States\u2019 economy or even the Nation\u2019s economy. Many have taken to private jets to ply the air, luxury boats to ply the waters and bullet proof cars to ply the roads. Many have rebuilt Governor\u2019s lodges and filled them with hangers- on. The more visible and grandiose the project, the better to catch the attention of our governors. The bubble was bound to burst at some point. Last year, it did and not surprisingly, it caught our leaders both State and Federal, napping. America had been talking about shale oil for quite a while. Saudi Arabia had indicated long ago that it would fight for its market share. Chinese economy had slowed down. More African countries had discovered oil in commercial quantities. All these meant there would be a glut in the short term and prices would drop. But nobody, including our world renowned economists did anything about it. In any case, we had been talking about diversifying the economy for a while and it had become just that\u2014 talk. Any State Government that therefore uses the dwindling revenue from the Federal purse as an alibi for not paying salaries is just as inept as the Federal Government it is accusing because we all saw it coming. What is wrong with the age-old tradition of trimming expenditure in line with your income? Any good business manager would have trimmed the work force in line with the looming reality a long time ago. Some would say it is not that straight forward in politics especially in a Civil Service State but look at the alternative. A senior Civil Servant in Osun State almost committed suicide two weeks ago because he could no longer meet his financial obligations. And this, unfortunately, is where it leads to; the suffering of the masses. At the best of times, our workers live from hand to mouth. And these are not the best of times. These are the times when the month end does not bring any financial relief.No honest worker can survive not earning a salary for seven months. Some are being owed almost a year\u2019s salary. For starters, no serious work or productivity can take place in any institution where workers are owed for that long. But that\u2019s half of the problem. The economy of the State itself, no matter how strong, will begin to slow down and previous gains, if there was any, would be lost.But the real story is what happens in the homes. It starts with house rents not being paid, school fees not being paid, credit being sought for food and other essentials. Then sources of credit dry up because everybody is broke and scarcity of household essentials begins to bite. The real tragedy is when infant mortality rate begins to rise, malnutrition rate begins to rise and friction at home between spouses begins to rise as well. Then depression sets in; tempers are short, aggression is on the surface. Those who think the Arab Spring cannot happen in Nigeria should rethink. A hungry man is an angry man. A hungry man who has reached the end of his tethers and has lost hope and faith in the system is a very dangerous man indeed. As for the Governors, I think some of them should be charged for gross mismanagement and criminal neglect that can lead to social unrest. Many of them lack character, lack vision and are entirely without conscience. Even as dire as the situation is, many of the outgoing ones still took money from the empty coffers to pay themselves outrageous severance packages. Governor Aregbesola is touted to have done a lot for his State. He is also said to be a simple man with a caring heart. It is a pity that his feet of clay have been exposed. He is obviously not a good manager of resources. His transformation is probably on the surface at best. A true, genuine transformation is when you make your State economically viable and independent of both local and international hand-out. Related",

In as much as we are aware of the prevailing political situation, we have no other option but to agitate and draw attention to the glaring injustice meted out to the youths of Akwa-Ibom State by the NNPC,\u201d they asserted. The protesting youths, therefore, urged the Presidency to prevail on the NNPC to review the Oil and Gas Pipelines Surveillance Contract to Akwa-Ibom State to forestall avoidable action by them.

        "text": "By Obi Nwakanma Somewhere in Nigeria\u2019s new capital city, Abuja, is a street called \u201cWinston Churchill Street\u201d named in honour of Britain\u2019s famous wartime Prime Minister and Nigeria\u2019s former colonial overlord. To anybody with a sense of history, a street honouring Churchill in Nigeria\u2019s capital city is an oddity. Here is why: Winston Churchill strenuously opposed freedom and independence for Nigeria and the other colonies. In fact in 1945 in San Francisco at the formation of the United Nations, Churchill forcefully sought to re-interpret the meaning of the Atlantic Charter, for which Nigeria\u2019s Nnamdi Azikiwe essayed that challenge to the British Prime Minister in his famous essay declaring \u201cAfricans did not fight in the last war so that only Europeans would enjoy freedom.\u201d In the same token, the planners and administrators of Nigeria\u2019s new capital city have never thought even as a symbolic gesture to name a street in honour of Franklin Delano Roosevelt. The irony is intriguing, for it was this American president who, in 1945, unambiguously championed the rights of freedom for the colonized, declaring to Churchill, that America would not support or stand aside while Britain denied the rights of the colonies to political freedom. There are many among historians of the 20th century who believe that had Roosevelt lived; if he had not died on his way from the council of Yalta, that newly decolonized states would have had a fairer deal than they eventually got. The irony as I\u2019ve noted is, whereas Churchill is honoured with a street named after him in Nigeria\u2019s capital, none honours Roosevelt. It is not remarkable for such revisionisms follow Nigeria\u2019s national history, in which the true heroes of the nation are ignored, while its villains are celebrated with plinths mounted in their names. Just this week, Mr. Yayale Ahmed released the list of 50 Nigerians whom he said Nigeria honours. It is either that Mr. Ahmed does not really know Nigeria\u2019s political and cultural history or he chooses to invert or ignore it in drawing this list. There was no Mbonu Ojike, no Kola Balogun; no Adegoke Adelabu, key Nigerian nationalists of the 20th century. The records show that besides Zik in the 1940s, there was none more forceful and more central in Nigeria\u2019s anticolonial nationalist struggle than Mazi Mbonu Ojike; Adegoke \u201cpenkelemesi\u201d Adelabu and Kola Balogun. There was no Akanu Ibiam; no Kingsley Ozuomba Mbadiwe; no Nwafor Orizu; no Louis Nwachukwu Mbanefo; no M.I. Okpara; no Eyo Ita; no Sir Louis Ojukwu; no Mobolaji Bank-Anthony; no Raji Abdallah or Saad Zungur or Aminu Kano or Kashim Ibrahim; no Michael Imoudu; no Simeon Adebo; no Alvan Ikoku; no Pius Okigbo, no Eni Njoku, or any of the key leaders of the radical Zikist movement on that list. There was not even a mention of that nationalist clerk, who tried to assassinate Hugh Foot, the colonial secretary, as a singular act of anti-colonial defiance and died in the colonial mental asylum in Yaba where he was locked. There was no Israel Woba Njemanze; no Ben Enwonwu; no Fela Sowande. Yet we have on it many who should live in infamy. This fact indeed also reflects quite perfectly the Nigerian contradiction. It is the year of our jubilee \u2013 50 years after political independence \u2013 and there is nothing to celebrate except the agony of failed nationhood and missed opportunities. Nigerians are not celebrating. Let us be very plain with the truth, there is not much to celebrate. There are Nigerians who today feel that Nigeria should not exist; that it is an unworkable mishmash of peoples who still cling to their primordial affiliation; that there is no nation to speak of. That may be true. But truer still is that the infrastructure of nationhood which we inherited has not been built up to absorb and produce a transcendent national consciousness; a national myth to which all margins might unify. True, colonialism exploited and destabilized us historically, but we must be quite clear, that the British left us with some useful and indeed solid institutions: an efficient civil service, some great schools, an emergent national culture, and there are those who might argue, yes, access to an international language. That last part some may also argue was a left handed gift. But for whatever it is worth Nigeria began life as a new nation with an urgency which, as Chukwuemeka Odumegwu-Ojukwu has said, aimed at \u201cstartling the world.\u201d But 50 years down the road, we have made a thorough mess of the institutions we inherited. Our hospitals are dead. Our universities are a joke. Our public schools infrastructure is primitive and an insult to our children; our civil service is inefficient and corrupt, and our cities are ugly and poisoned; our national Railways and Postal Services are in ruins, and our nation is mired in conflict; ethnic and religious rivalries, insecurity, poverty, unemployment; our national patrimony has been frittered; Nigeria\u2019s national public investments sold off bit by bit to both local and international oligopolies and cronies under the fraudulent guise of privatization. Nigeria is, to put it bluntly, a cesspit of evil. Evil struts in a land in which 15 toddlers were kidnapped in South-Eastern Nigeria for ransom in the week of its jubilee. So, who is celebrating this jubilee? In 1979, I was among the children who marched at the Government fields in Umuahia celebrating the \u201cInternational Year of the Child.\u201d They said then, 31 years ago, that we were the future; leaders of tomorrow. Today, I and my generation are middle aged men and women. We arrived at a stolen future. Nigeria celebrates 50 years of tragic failure. We must not gloss over this fact. In deed, it is part of the great charade that has characterized this country, whose prospects seems increasingly to look like the future of Haiti. The historical similarities are so totally intriguing. Nigeria bungles everything. Let us draw an example of Ghana\u2019s own jubilee three years ago. The pure elegance and symbolism of it drew new attention to the potentials of Ghana. They did not spend the kind of billions that Nigeria\u2019s government has budgeted and spent for frivolities. Yet, there has to be something more than despair. Despair is easy, and it is futile. We have failed and we cannot escape that fact. Nigeria\u2019s failure however must compel a new generation which must start now to rebuild. To rebuild and prepare this country for its centenary as a free nation, we must sweep away the muck. Among the muck are the deadwood politicians, failed \u201cradicals,\u201d bogus intellectuals ; they have nothing else to offer Nigeria but the last fifty years \u2013 the failure of their imagination and the limits of their abilities. This is indeed the year of our jubilee. While we have not much of value to celebrate, a new Nigeria must nonetheless emerge from this ruin. This generation must retrieve Nigeria from the pit and from the vice grip of the scoundrels who have raped her. This is the urgent task of now. Related",

        "author": "Debbie Olujobi",
        "text": "By Debbie Olujobi The recent trial and eventual conviction of Michael Jackson\u2019s physician Dr Conrad Murray has recently brought the American judicial system under a microscope before the whole world. The world saw a slew of evidence and very convincing arguments that led most of us to be fairly sure of the guilt of the not so good doctor. We watched the lawyers try and sway the jury of compelling arguments and different interpretations of the vast array of evidence that were made available by law enforcement and the coroner\u2019s office. The members of the jury played a very prominent role in the proceedings as it was up to them to weigh the arguments and evidence and come up with a verdict. For those not in the know, A jury trial (or trial by jury) is a legal proceeding in which a jury either makes a decision or makes findings of fact which are then applied by a judge. It is distinguished from a bench trial, in which a judge or panel of judges make all decisions. I remember being particularly struck by a phrase; the judge had talked about Conrad Murray being judged by a jury of his peers and I had mulled over that for several days. It caught my interest just as another phrase that has been playing in my immediate environment lately. The phrase was \u201cthe strife of tongues\u201d and for some reason both terms had rolled into one and the same for me. They both carried elements of judgement, either fairly or unfairly and involved condemnation if so determined by opinions formed by persuasion of others. The song \u201cit\u2019s a small world after all\u201d describes my world view as I live in a reality that probably doesn\u2019t exist outside of my head. I have come to accept that I am made of extremely fragile materials and have given up trying to develop a thick skin to fit into the world. My solution to exist and live in harmony has been to keep my world extremely small and consciously choose to be happy; malice doesn\u2019t exist in my world because it can\u2019t find a way in. I also suffer from a serious lack of curiosity so I tend not to know anything about anyone unless my opinion is expressly sought. I was mulling over the above phrases when I concluded that they were pretty much the same but I am more fascinated with the jury of peers. To my understanding peers refer to persons of the same legal status or persons who are equal to another in abilities, qualifications, age, background, and social status. The idea of a jury in a trial I believe is to get people who can relate to similar positions to come together and voice their opinions on the guilt or innocence of whoever is on trial. Being a Nigerian I am not likely to ever face a legal jury trial as it is not practised here but I strongly believe most of us have at one time or the other faced a jury of unfriendly peers in the shape of vindictive gossip and venomous malice. My musings on the phrases have nothing to do with their applications except that I strongly question the title of peer. It is my opinion that no two human beings are the same and one would be hard pressed to come across anyone worthy of judging the other. I am backed up a friend\u2019s Blackberry message \u201cdon\u2019t judge me because you are not in my shoes\u201d. I had agreed with the sentiment and not given it much thought till a few days ago when I came into the knowledge that I had been on the receiving end of some intense strife of nefarious tongues. I hadn\u2019t been amused initially but I can\u2019t give energy to negativity so I just drew a line and surgically trimmed the institution that bred the strife out of my world. My first instinct had been to lash back and I certainly had a constituency that could do major damage but that would have in my opinion validated the peerage. It would mean that I agreed that I was amongst a jury of peers; people of equals in belief, creed and status and God forbid I be lumped with darkness. To be continued Related",

        "text": "By Debbie Ogunjobi Writing is cathartic; it\u2019s the best way to really look at situations and make an appraisal that puts into consideration the truth and one\u2019s core beliefs and convictions. It\u2019s an expression that is divine and therapeutic and tonight (it\u2019s 3am) the night is a friend and a willing accomplice to this most noble of arts!! Information is power; knowing the contents of people\u2019s character is power and preservation rolled into one. It takes the surprise out of attacks and if one is attacked when one is prepared; it\u2019s a battle one can certainly win. The past week had a few unpleasant surprises and I mourn the loss of a mentor. If someone hitherto held in high esteem degenerates to a level of unsurpassed disgust it is as sad as sudden death. The world becomes smaller as the giant becomes the ant but the shrinkage also means the sun comes out of the erstwhile giant\u2019s shadow. It\u2019s important to pay attention to changes in season and time and realise that pain is a sign of growth; we stretch painfully to become giants ourselves. It\u2019s a rude shock to find oneself land lobbed in a colony of bats who prefer life in darkness, hanging upside down. Any gathering that entertains, celebrates and validates the strife of tongues is a gathering of peers alright,though I would suggest that they are more closely related to bats; they may have aspirations of flight but they are no better than airborne rats! It all boils down to the assumption that peers are equals in all respects and I would respectfully submit that only the fact that most people are Homo sapiens qualify them to be grouped together in any respect. A normal peer group is a social group consisting of humans; they are not necessarily of like minds even when convenience or conviction brings them together. When not in a legal sense Peer groups are an informal primary group of people who share a similar or equal status and who are usually of roughly the same age/ generation. In this group, a code of conduct exists that suggests similar interests and passions but only on the surface. Most peers are kept together by the stimulus of pressure which influences behaviour and conduct. I used to be part of one such group back in my student days and it didn\u2019t take long after we graduated to split the group up. We evolved out of a need to survive our location and situation as poor students and once that pressure was relieved we found that most of us had nothing in common and gladly went our separate ways. Like all human associations there is always a vein that runs through its existence and it is either negative or positive. It can be a peer association borne out of religion or even social and cultural obligations. I am finding to my horror that I may have inadvertently been complicit into becoming part of one such group that may yet prove to be a monster garbed in pretty clothes. I wonder if ignorance would be a valid excuse should my suspicion be confirmed on judgement day! It is possible that most of us in a bid to quench the emptiness inside of us stop seeking the light and fall for the eclipse that is blocking the light itself!! I am reminded of a similar situation faced by my closest friend a few years back and I am amused to find myself in exactly the same predicament I had told her could never befall me as I didn\u2019t believe in groups that regimented and controlled ones existence. I am left wondering what it takes to avoid strife of any sort especially by people who barely know you and make up anything to support the judgement they have made. I conclude with a sigh and a smile. I have no control over people\u2019s actions or tongues but I can determine my reaction. I can live by a code of conduct that keeps me simple of mind and joyful of heart. Life is an unfolding tapestry of complex patterns and colours and there\u2019s never a dull moment. We are judged by people who know us and even those who don\u2019t; their humanity makes them the jury of peers but I totally disagree with the definition that we have a lot in common if anything at all. When I am flummoxed by situations out of my control; I step out of it so God can take care of it. Like Gregory Peck \u201cmy faith gives me an inner strength, a sense of balance and a perspective in life\u201d. When anyone seeks my counsel on strife and malice I ask them to ask God for help and like David say a prayer (found in Psalm 144: 7-8) \u201cSend thine hand from above o Lord; rid me and deliver me out of great waters, from the hand of strange children; whose mouth speaketh vanity, and their right hand is a right hand of falsehood\u201d Related",

        "text": "By Bisi Lawrence The lady must have been a natural southpaw the way she lashed out at her fellow legislator, who was, fortunately a real gentleman. The lady\u2014 we\u2019ll continue to call her that, not for want of a more suitable description, but to retain some respect for the venue of her sustained assault \u2014allowed no restraint on her determined attack in the \u201challowed\u201d chamber of the House of Representatives, while her victim did not raise a hand to retaliate, he absorbed two furious open-handed blows to the body while vainly trying to reason with his aggressive law-maker who was busy looking for a hay-maker. Such incidents, regrettably, are no longer a rarity. At the drop of a pin in our House of Representatives, it is now almost the norm for tempers to rise and fists to fly. It has become the shameful habit of shameless \u201chonourable\u201d men \u2013 and women. Kawu Baraje It took the imbroglio that has now consumed the rank and file of the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, to bring it up once again on the floor of the Lower House. While the internecine challenges which have fractionalized the PDP continue to fester in the open for all to see, the high officials of the organization persist in calling it a \u201cfamily\u201d dissension. A State Governor\u2019s aircraft is grounded, whilst permission to operate is denied another; the normal running of a State House of Assembly is suspended whilst the House of Representatives is mandated to assume its responsibilities; a State Governor is barred the usual entry to his official residence by the police on the orders of their boss who is openly at daggers drawn with his State Executive; several ministers are relieved of their positions because of their putative connections with the break-away faction of the ruling party; a full-fledged faction flaunts a rampant stance in the face of everybody\u2014 and all of that is called \u201cfamily\u201d? To expect anyone to believe that is the apogee of naivety. But that is probably what they call \u201cpolitics\u201d. Unfortunately, it is also an example of the insincerity and levity with which the PDP is prone to treat the entire nation about issues that demand a serious approach. It is as though the rest of us are totally ignorant about what is happening around us. But now one may wonder: how did the purely domestic matter of a political party erupt into a rumpus in the House of Representatives? It was at the instance of the splinter group which felt impelled to carry their case before the members of the House of Representatives, The other group had also shown a willingness to do the same, but backed away at the last minute from the bizarre move, probably sensing the unpleasant reception that it would face. But the Baraje-led faction, variously referred to as the New PDP, or nPDP, opted to pursue the unusual course. The situation into which the party had thrown itself was awful enough, one might have thought, without involving the membership of the House of Representatives. While it is normal for the legislators to be involved as politicians in an issue that is politically red-hot, they should have been left to react as individuals or under the auspices of their own contrived caucuses. All along they had been holding a series of meetings which they presented as the stepping-stones to an imminent resolution of the differences which had elicited so much bitterness and victimization from the parent body \u2013 which ostensibly holds the reins of government. But they rise from each meeting with their swords still unsheathed, yet with the fable that their difficulties would soon be eliminated. In fact, it was such a meeting that immediately preceded the move to address the House of Representatives, and the subsequent fracas. From this distance and the view it affords at the moment, there is hardly anyone who can correctly predict what may happen to this party, the PDP that is, and to this country as a consequence. We have a tight logjam here. From the body language of the parent body, the core demands of the splinter group will definitely not be met, except in one or two instances and grudgingly at that. For instance, it would be nothing short of capitulation to accede to the removal of Tukur from the chairmanship of the party, unless a face-saving ploy of unusual magnitude could be devised. A tone of disingenuousness pervades the other areas of the disagreement where some concessions seem to have been granted, but those do not include and will never include \u2014President Goodluck Jonathan\u2019s \u201cavowed intent\u201d to retain the presidency. And this is really the crux of the matter. But no matter what happens later, we have to decide to offer due respect to our legislative houses. These are the temples in which we have enshrined our belief as a nation in the rule of law. Our behaviour in any of the chambers of law-making must evince our respect for the institutions we have devised for our well-being, and by which we strive to sustain our integrity. Scuffles and affrays must cease in our parliament from today. A law should be made against such a distasteful and demeaning practice. Jesus is Lord Echoes: I usually find your forays into religious matters interesting. I can see that you are a Christian. Which denomination do you belong to, and why? I am a Roman Catholic and I believe it is the first and best. Would you like to share your views? Not particularly, as a matter of fact. Religion is a very personal item in a human being\u2019s life, and sharing views may easily lead to offence. For instance, in no more than five sentences above, you have already attacked my denomination. That precisely was what you did when you stated that Roman Catholicism \u201cis the first and the best\u201d. You implied that my own choice is worse, and that is offensive already. I shall not defend that choice actually, except to depose that no denomination is perfect. I was once a Roman Catholic myself. I married in the Holy Cross Cathedral in Lagos. I had to seek for another way of worshipping Christ when I came up against doubts that I could not surmount about the quality of my devotions. I presented these issues to several priests but had no satisfaction. So I left and embraced Anglicanism into which I was born, in the first place. And would you believe that I ran smack dab into the issues from which I had run away in the Roman Catholic Church? It had to do with images. It was in my old church, a cathedral too. It had now acquired a new occupant in the form of a carving installed within the sanctuary. Anyone in robes \u2014 priests, vergers, choristers, the lot \u2014 went before it and bowed at the beginning or some specific phase of the religious service. I was aghast! For twenty-six years I made my resentment known. I had few takers\u2013 but I did have some and some of them even left the church while I was still campaigning against this thing I described as an \u201ceffigy.\u201d I complained to one administrator of the church who took umbrage at my protests which he said could \u201cdivide\u201d the church. That frightened me no end. Then when he left, I raised the matter with his replacement whom I knew rather well, and with whom I had previously discussed the matter of the effigy when he was in another parish. He had fervently supported my views at that time, so I felt I had found a kindred spirit who would offer me his full support. But when I broached the matter before him now that he was in charge, he sounded very embarrassed. So I went to the top. I spoke to the Bishop who promised to look into the matter. But his lordship was usually busy and there was an extent beyond which one does not worry a bishop. So I let the matter drop for a while. But I still had one ploy left. I belonged to a very important society in the church, and I was confident that the members would see my point of view. So I got myself invited to a committee meeting where I could present my case. I was warmly received, but not so my presentation. And it was all so clear to me. The Second Commandment states: \u201cYou shall not make for yourself a graven image, or the likeness of anything that is in heaven above, or on the earth beneath, or that is in the water under the earth; you shall not bow down before them or serve them \u2026 \u201c What could be more lucid? The caveat, \u201cof anything that is in heaven above or on the earth beneath\u201d definitely includes God Himself and, by inference, Jesus Christ. Thus He states that we should not make an idol of Him, because if you make an effigy of God you can only worship it since it is God. I would have liked to delve a bit deeper, but you should get what I mean. I have nothing against Roman Catholics; I have issues with Roman Catholicism. I have issues with denominations \u2014the very idea of it. But if you are a Christian, you would belong to one. The important thing is also to belong to Jesus. Jesus is Lord, Time out. Related",

But even before his departure, the judgment of history on his administration already seems clear. This is evident even in the long queues of vehicles at fuel stations across the country, testimony to the level of corruption and incompetence that has marked governance in the last six years. It may seem rather unfair to judge the president in terms of the failure in the energy sector given the fact that he made his own impact, however little, in other sectors of the economy. But whatever success might be recorded for Goodluck Jonathan has been blighted by the mountain of failures that he chalked-up during his term in office. Nigeria cannot but be angry at the fact that, as producers of oil, they have had to suffer trying to get the commodity in the last three weeks or thereabout. They would justifiably be angrier at the comments of insiders of this administration like Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, the Minister of Finance who claimed several of her colleagues had become victims of high blood pressure as a result of the stress they\u2019ve been under, working to improve the Nigerian economy. Evidence of these high blood pressure-induced hard work is no where to be seen in the lives of Nigerians, many of whom have to live from hand to mouth. Perhaps, Mrs. Iweala who has definitely outstayed her welcome in government and others such as Mrs.Diezeani Allison-Madueke have indeed worked hard, but they must have expended their energy on the wrong things, in the wrong direction or simply for their personal benefits. Which is where those who hold brief for them as if they were that vulnerable get it wrong. Diezeani Allison-Madueke\u2019s assumed vulnerability follows the ascent of a Pharaoh (read Buhari) who did not know \u2018Joseph\u2019. It is at best a put-on to deflect attention from her recent past as one of the untouchables of the Jonathan administration whose excesses brought the government to deserved grief. The government failed royally or Nigerians wouldn\u2019t be spending long hours or even days trying to get a so-called subsidised commodity that is produced right in their back yard. The energy sector in Nigeria can be characterised as the ware house of sleaze and corruption, a mad house where people spend what they don\u2019t have or deep their hands into the commonwealth as if it was their private inheritance. After all, the people there seem to be operating as with a \u2018blank cheque\u2019, as the Pricewater House Coopers report has it. Whatever profit there is in the energy sector, or more specifically, that the NNPC makes ultimately ends up in the financial black hole that the Corporation has dug for its own good, in the sustenance of the fabulous lifestyles of officials of the petroleum ministry and the lavish billions allegedly spent on chartered flights. When one sees the suffering that Nigerians have endured as they struggle to purchase fuel from the black market and unauthorised sources, one cannot but conclude that they must be glad President Jonathan didn\u2019t have the benefit of another term in office. His ouster in the March 28, 2015 election looks like a boon from above. It is not hard to imagine what four more years under his rule would have been like. Nigerians would have had to endure yet another four years of misery under the do-nothing government of an irresponsible leadership. Surely, those four years would not have ended without the country facing some violent rupture of some sorts. Another four year term for Goodluck Jonathan on the same leadership style and frequency would have been an open invitation to chaos and disorder. In such circumstance, Nigeria would have been clearly divided into two classes of the extremely rich and the abjectly poor, leaving room for the first uprising of the poor against the rich. It is never a good thing that a government, worse yet an individual, should be remembered in terms of their negative attributes. It however looks like the Jonathan administration would be remembered more in terms of what the president didn\u2019t get right than the things he did for the benefit of Nigeria. This is the price the president must pay for giving free reign to his subordinates to the extent that several of them practically forgot that there was a president elected by Nigerians and to whom they were accountable. Goodluck Jonathan has been praised for his so-called statesmanship by conceding victory in the 2015 election without choosing the path of electoral tribunals and their interminable sessions. But the truth really is that he did not have a better option in the matter. It was, perhaps, in recognition of this and the hostage situation in which he finds himself with his subordinates that he decided to give up on any attempt to contest the outcome of the election. As he himself said in a particularly poignant moment after the election and the release of its result, he had been a prisoner in the powerhouse called government in the last 16 years. The time is ripe for Goodluck Jonathan to go home and he couldn\u2019t have had a better opportunity after the 2015 election. Now he can go home to a good rest, whether well deserved or not. If the likes of Ed Milliband, leader of the Labour Party, could take full responsibility for the defeat of his party even when he won his own seat, Nigerians might be making too much of Goodluck Jonathan\u2019s concession of defeat in the last election. It was the logical and responsible thing to do after the wasted billions of Naira and millions of dollars he had spent in the last few weeks before the election in the hope of turning certain defeat into victory. Nigerians wanted him out more than they probably wanted Buhari in. He could have been defeated by any candidate, provided such had the backing of a credible opposition party as the All Progressives Congress was to the Peoples Democratic Party. But Buhari had the advantage of a worthy reputation as an incorruptible leader, the very point on which the Jonathan government is in deficit. The long and short of this all is that Jonathan has had his chance. He might not have used it to the best advantage of Nigerians. He surely fell short of the high expectations of the people who stood up for him when a few who imagined themselves powerful stood in his way and tried to stop him from taking his rightful position as president. Nigerians spoke for him then. But the same Nigerians now cannot wait to see his back. Let him go in peace. Related",

        "author": "Obi Nwakanma",
        "text": "By Obi Nwakanma Parliament is the powerful engine room of the grand edifice of democracy. There, is where we make or mar the sovereign. A powerful parliament is an agenda-setting institution. Whatever happens in the hallowed chamber of the people sets the pace for public governance. When we examine it thoroughly, the fight for democracy, all that battle we, my generation, fought on the streets for a return to democracy was in truth for the reconstitution of the parliament and, of parliamentary oversight over the executive. By its military character, the executive branch of state had become a dictatorship. Governance was by the fiat of decrees crafted without recourse to the demands of the public. The republic was in abeyance. That created disjuncture \u2013 a tyranny. That disjuncture was marked by the absence of representation. Without the parliament, there is no democracy. There would be no means by which the interest of the public is determined, protected, and projected as the basis of executive action. Without the parliament of the land the laws of the land become the crass habitu\u00e9s of executive rascality. The elected and properly constituted parliament of the land is what makes distinct the character, substance and significance of all the \u201carchies\u201d: the monarchy, the patriarchy, the tetrarchy, the oligarchy \u2013 and so on: it removes the endowment of power in a single, symbolic individual or sovereign and places the sovereignty in the hands of the people and their elected spokespeople. The legislature, for that reason alone, is the highest organ of power in the land. A self-aware, well organised, and fully-charged legislature makes certain that the land is well-governed and protected from the excesses of a few men. It is an awareness of its symbolic and real power or value under democracy that we insist on democracy as the most civilized form of government. But from the start of Nigeria\u2019s return to democratic governance in 1999, the legislature has been manipulated and destabilized by certain means. The first means was by the serious disabling of parliamentary leadership which led to catalepsy in the Nigerian system. The executive went wild with corruption, it became intolerant of opposition, and almost tyrannical. From 1999 to 2007, the Obasanjo years, it did not feel as though Nigeria was in a democracy. We were frequently reminded of its teething problems by defenders of the regime who used such words as \u201cnascent democracy,\u201d a term that assumed that the procedural growth of a democratic tradition was dependent on puerile mistakes. That Nigerians must learn democracy by fault. I always felt such phrases to be fatuous certainly, especially because, in fact, democracy is a felt thing. Well, of course, I speak as an Igbo with a long tradition of democratic governance going back to antiquity, long before Solon brought the democratic ideal back to Athens. But, of course, I should say, over the years, with the corruption of the public from years of colonialism and military dictatorship, generations emerged who became socialized under Nigeria\u2019s brand of military rule with its valoration of monarchical, patriarchal and oligarchic authority. Besides, of course, democracy depends on an enlightened citizenry aware of its power through their parliamentary delegation. Because Nigerians have seen more of the public expression of extreme executive authority, they have been unable to recognize the real power in the legislature. The legislature is the keeper of the national purse. Legislators are the trustees of the corporate interests of the nation. They authorize the use of public fund. They approve the budgets; review budgetary claims; and verify the claims made by the executive. They have the power to summon and sanction the president of the nation in the face of dereliction, lawlessness, and extreme use of state power. For instance, the legislature can investigate the uses of public fund. But above all, they have the mandate of the people to set the agenda for public governance. The function of the executive is simply to execute legislative mandate. So, while the president and the administrative branch of state represent the public face of government, the real shadow authority is the legislature. This is why it is important to elect thoughtful and highly- educated men and women to the Assemblies of the land, for there, is where the real soul of the sovereign beats. The craft of law-making is a cerebral as well as a moral act. I think, of course, I\u2019m speaking to the choir with the likes of my friend, Dr. Chudi Uwazurike, who has been elected into the incoming Federal House of Representatives. I feel certain that we have moved away from nascent or pediatric democracy to full, adult democracy, and so I feel that the attention must shift to the real function of the legislature of the land for full accounting to the people. It is imperative for Chudi and his peers in the coming Assembly to set a new tone and to establish a new thrust of action towards more legislative oversight of the executive arm of state. There has to be a new legislative agenda to restore Nigeria\u2019s sovereign mandate. There are legislations waiting on the burner. I think I have a few suggestions. One must be a review of the Military Act to expand Nigeria\u2019s military capabilities and the mission of the Nigerian Armed Forces given strategic developments in the Gulf of Guinea as well as the upper and lower Sahel as they pertain to Nigeria\u2019s national interest. Central elements to this act must be a bill for mandatory military service for Nigerians from age 19-35 \u2013 a national reserve that will be at the heart of a more productive military that could absorb all the technical capacities necessary for its new role. The second should be a National Health Act modeled after the National Health Services system of the UK. Access to public health requires a new funding regime and a general improvement in the national health infrastructure. The third should be a review of the Nigerian Railways Act to allow for internal linkages and expansion of the National Rail stock, and for greater regional investor participation in Rail transport development. The fourth should be a parliamentary or National Assemblies Commission for the reform of the Nigerian Civil Service leading ultimately to a new Federal Civil Service Act. It is a broken service and it is about time we recognized that without a highly-selective and efficient service, Nigeria will continue to be mired in the morass of corruption and inefficiency. The Civil Service Act must hold for merit-based appointments into the administrative cadre up to 90 per cent and reserve 10 per cent only for \u201cfederal character\u201d requirements. I think it is important to enact the Anti-Discrimination and Equal Opportunity Act that will make it criminal to discriminate against Nigerians in the workplace, in the public space, on jobs and access to government contracts, on housing and so on, irrespective of religion or ethnicity. I think an important new law for this Assembly must be the Police Act to reform the Nigerian police services and take into account Nigerian federal status. Finally, I think it is also imperative to revisit and craft a new Tax and Revenue Law for Nigeria to reflect its federal status. I think it is time to stop the funding of local governments from the federation accounts. But above all, I think it is time to keep the executive branch honest. Related",

        "title": "A lesson in democracy for Buharimaniacs",
        "author": "Femi Aribisala",
        "text": "By Femi Aribisala It will take some time for those Douglas Anele fondly refers to as Buharimaniacs to realize that, in a democracy, there is nothing definitive about the outcome of an election. When an election has been concluded, those who opposed the winner are not required to shut up or go into exile. They are required to go into opposition. Those who opposed the winner are not defeated. As a matter of fact, their opposition may be justified subsequently by the actions and inactions of the winner. PRESIDENT MUHAMMADU BUHARI In his six months in office, President Buhari has done little to change the view of his opponents that he was the wrong choice as president of Nigeria. On the contrary, he has done a lot to confirm their fears. Rather than enjoy a honeymoon period, the president has squandered his earlier goodwill. As a matter of fact, if the election were to be re-held today, Buhari would not win. If he would, it would only be by the smallest of margins. Sensitive supporters Buhari supporters are very touchy. They would not have anybody criticize their president, even when such criticisms are justified. They feel vindicated by Buhari\u2019s victory and believe that should be the end of the matter. However, Buhari\u2019s victory is actually the beginning of the matter. With his victory, the matter ended with Jonathan and Buhari becomes the issue. This is what the president himself has failed to understand. In the last six months, he has insisted that Jonathan is still the issue. He is not any longer. Buhari\u2019s supporters are beginning to be embarrassed by his poor performance since he assumed office. Many who continue to support him do so because they are already committed to him. They find it difficult to admit they may have made a mistake. They are very sensitive whenever anyone criticizes the government. Some even become abusive and react on social media blogs by telling such persons to: \u201cGo and hug a transformer.\u201d No such luck! Since Buhari supporters did not hug transformers under Jonathan; neither will Jonathan supporters hug transformers under Buhari. Since Buhari supporters did not go into exile under Jonathan; neither will Jonathan supporters go into exile under Buhari. Since Buhari supporters did not keep silent under Jonathan, neither will Jonathan supporters keep silent under Buhari. Lessons in Democracy: Buhari supporters need to take courses in \u201cDemocracy 101.\u201d Jonathan\u2019s supporters will not vanish into thin air just because he lost an election. Neither will they lose their voice because of the government\u2019s onslaught against everything Jonathan. It is absolutely important that the voice of the opposition continues to be heard loud and clear. The rights of losers are protected under the Constitution. Indeed, the rights of losers become more important than the rights of winners in a democratic system. Losers are protected from winners, ensuring that today\u2019s losers can become tomorrow\u2019s winners. It should not be forgotten that Jonathan defeated Buhari in 2011. Therefore, Buhari supporters should not be too pumped up simply because Buhari defeated Jonathan in 2015. Nobody ever said the 2015 election was the election to end all elections. Neither do elections under the Nigerian presidential system of government subscribe to the principle of \u201cwinner takes all.\u201d Part of the problem here is that this is the very first time a government in Nigeria will be defeated by the opposition at the federal level. Therefore, the victors and their supporters are acting as if it is the end of the world. Rather than celebrate and promote the process that made this change of government possible, Buharimaniacs seem determined to ensure it will hardly be repeated. One-party government That is why both the government and its supporters insist the APC is entitled to everything by virtue of winning the 2015 election. That is why they are so angry that a PDP man is Deputy Senate president. An attempt was even made on his life. That is why all the signs point to a determination to create a one-party APC state in Nigeria by hook or crook. The APC is not satisfied with winning; it is determined to strangulate the opposition PDP to death. That is why the APC keeps absorbing PDP defectors every day; so much so that it is already becoming a parody of the PDP. That is why PDP victories are being overturned while APC victories are being confirmed. That is why those who were prominent actors in the Jonathan administration are being hounded, harassed and tried in the court of manipulated public opinion. That is why every PDP member is a demon, but when he defects to the APC he automatically becomes a saint. When you point out these contradictions to APC supporters, they remain unconcerned because deep down they do not believe in democracy. They only see it as a means to an end. Exaggerated victory It is important to remind our dear Buharimaniacs that, out of a country of 170 million, only 15 million voted for Buhari in 2015; 155 million did not. Those 15 million only constitute 52% of the votes. That can hardly be construed as an overwhelming support by any stretch of the imagination. Buhari won the election, but only just. Like his supporters, he is mistaken in thinking he needs to pay more attention to those who supported him. On the contrary, he now has a responsibility to win over those who did not. However, the president has lost many of those who gave him the benefit of the doubt in March 2015. Six months down the road, nothing has changed for the better. Some things have even gone from bad to worse. Fuel crises and fuels queues are back. The financial hemorrhage of the petroleum subsidy remains. Food prices have hit the roof. We are back to the jungle days where warehouses of private citizens are raided and dubious officials cart away bags of rice belonging to hapless market-women. Buhari\u2019s infamous body language is no longer celebrated. The bad old days of power shortages are here again with a vengeance. The president\u2019s boast that the back-bone of Boko Haram will be broken by December 2015 is now clearly a pie-in-the-sky. Boko Haram remains to date the most deadly insurgency in the world; killing more innocent people in Nigeria than any other terrorist group anywhere else. This makes it all the more ludicrous that the same people who labeled Jonathan \u201cclueless\u201d are offended when people call Buhari \u201cBaba Go-Slow\u201d or \u201cBaba No Movement.\u201d They have not stopped criticizing Jonathan even though he is no longer in power and is not responsible for the government\u2019s lack of policies; how then can they expect Nigerians not to criticize Buhari since the buck now stops with him? Double standards Time was when everyone who approved of Jonathan\u2019s government was castigated outright as a PDP contractor. Since that label no longer passes muster, every critic of the present government is now called a Buhari hater. But then how much love do Buharimaniacs have for Jonathan? If Jonathan did not deserve love, why must Buhari now be entitled to it? People like me never supported Jonathan until we saw the virulent hatred of his opponents. We never cared for the mischievous PDP until we discovered that Jonathan\u2019s opponents were so desperate for power, they were even prepared to destroy the nation in the process. They were so determined to seize power; they threatened to \u201csoak the dog and the baboon in blood\u201d if they did not get their wish. Thank God, Jonathan was not like them in defeat. I, for one, came to Jonathan\u2019s defense because it is an article of my faith to defend the weak and not the strong. Even though Jonathan was the president, within the context of Nigerian politics, he still was the weak because he comes from a minority ethnic group. Therefore, those of us who believe in one Nigeria objected to the gang-up of the majority groups against him. Farewell to Jonathan: Before the election, I had written already a \u201cDear President Jonathan\u201d article prepared against the expectation that he would be re-elected. In that article, since overtaken by his defeat, I stated beforehand that my undiluted support for him ended with his re-election. With his re-election, we would insist on cashing the cheque for our support by demanding that his second-term must be very different from his first. Indeed, in my Vanguard column of 13th May, 2014 entitled: \u201cA Season of Conspiracies against Goodluck Jonathan,\u201d I wrote the following: \u201cWe must forget our differences and join hands to ensure that Jonathan prevails in spite of all the stumbling blocks and minefields put in his way. So doing, we would be able to make effective demands on the president. He would have to listen to us. \u201cWith the added pressure from the international community, we will insist that the corruption that has gone through the roof under his administration must finally come to an end. The time is long overdue: some malefactors must be arrested, prosecuted and jailed. No more pussy-footing. Nigerians require a transparent government; and we require this \u2018yesterday.\u2019\u201d Buhari apologists However, Jonathan did not win the election: he lost. But what do we have today? Instead of inspiring him to greater heights, Buharimaniacs have become his apologists. Instead of coming out to express their disappointment at the government\u2019s dismal performance to date and insist he must keep his promises, Buharimaniacs are now the ones making excuses for him. The same people who were impatient with Jonathan are now preaching the virtues patience for Buhari. Those demanding that the rule of law must be upheld under Jonathan now make excuses for the disregard of the rule of law under Buhari. Those who would normally insist that the innocent must be deemed innocent until proven guilty in a court of law, are now calling for Diezani and Dasuki to face the firing squad without proof of guilt. Those who refuse to question where APC got the money to fight its costly election, are suddenly furious that the PDP might have used government funds for the election. Unexpectedly, 100 days is no longer acceptable as a yardstick for evaluating the competence of a new government. It is now suitable to take five months to choose ministers who turn out to be the same old and tried crop. Suddenly, the Minister of Petroleum can no longer be held responsible for petrol shortages just because he now happens to be the president himself. One thing is becoming crystal clear. Buharimaniacs are economical with the truth. Buharimaniacs are not democrats. Buharimaniacs have neither regard for, nor understanding of, democracy. Related",

        "author": "Bisi Lawrence",
        "text": "By Bisi Lawrence One of the exasperating and sometimes tragic aspects of situations that are patently intractable is their tendency to develop unpredictable ramifications. That often happens when measures introduced are either ill-timed, or hypocritically motivated, or both. The visit of General Olusegun Obasanjo, former President of Nigeria, to the family of the late founder of Boko Haram has only added a sickening dimension to the continued horror of the Islamic terrorist group which now holds the entire country in thrall, regardless of his purpose in making that seemingly mindless journey. The only reason, or justification, his apologists could summon to explain the irrational timing of the visit to fall on the same day when the nation was honoring the memory of those who died in the bombing attack on the Abuja UN building, was that he probably did not know about it. That is not easy to believe. If he felt concerned enough to visit the birthplace of Boko Haram, he could not have been far from the information about the arrangements of the national effort to pay our last respects to the victims of the fanatical religious group. It is rather far easier to surmise that he was not formally invited, and that he would naturally have considered a slight. And, knowing him, one would find it quite in his character to react on the scale of megalomania from which the scenario of that visit would flow. And that fits in perfectly with Professor Wole Soyinka\u2019s reference to an \u201cego trip\u201d. To some uncharitable minds, the professor\u2019s incisive criticism of this latest of Obasanjo\u2019s antics was no more than a continuation of the disagreement that is well known to exist between both of them. But the Nobel laureate is well known to be definitely of a more noble nature than that. The suggestion is an insult he must shrug aside. The entire incident is made more poignant by the fact that it occurred just around the first anniversary of Gani Fawehinmi\u2019s death. That would have been another voice to condemn the unfeeling pettiness of a man who is burdened by the hollow sense of his self-importance. Obasanjo set out to demonstrate nothing more than that. He himself could not put a tag on his unpatriotic action other than that of \u201ca learning process\u201d, even before the tragedy that sprung up in its wake. But what did he learn? What could he have learnt? The operations of Boko Haram could not have been revealed through a cursory visit to one of the relatives or associates of its founder. His apologists had even tossed it up and tossed it down that he had displayed commendable boldness by what they saw as his attempt to mediate peace between the Boko Haram and the Federal Government. But would that be appropriate on the day that the country was mourning the tragedy that was caused by the brutality of the terrorist organization? Well, if he wanted to engage himself in a \u201clearning process\u201d, he has indeed been given a lesson. advisers advised The killings continue unabated. It hurts because we are left with the fearsome impression that no one really seems to know what to do. We change National Security Advisers like dirty underwear. With the latest revelations of one the co-founders of the Boko Haram that the warnings he gave to some security officials were ignored, more heads may roll. But what was the purpose of these warnings other than to intensify the effect of the terror already planned? These senior officials in our security hierarchy are men of sterling antecedents in law enforcement, or military tactics. But raw security circumstances seem to proclaim them as no more than semi-professionals in that area. Thus we are slapped on the face every day, by nuggets of advice presented on the pages of the newspaper to our national advisers by you and me, and every other home-grown security expert. How droll! Without a doubt, the spate of counsel and recommendations is in good faith. For instance, we too have suggested on this page that the discovery of the source of its funds would go a long way towards exposing the identity of its sponsors. That, in fact, is elementary \u2013 as a theory. But we have even been supported by distinguished citizens who declare that the identity of those sponsors is a basic step that must be taken if we are to move forward. Was there any information in that regard among the so-called warnings that are purported to have been afforded? However, it all seems easier said than accomplished. But we have to appreciate the fact that the situation is a novel one to our security apparatus. We have had to contend with little more than sporadic civil unrests now and then, not a sustained tide of terror in our country. We have never been called out by a well-trained, well-disciplined band of murderers and marauders equipped with sophisticated weapons like this before. We did not have to engage an implacable enemy who knows everything about us but yields so little of himself to our knowledge. We are faced by a foe without a known face. Obviously, what is called for here is a paradigm shift. Our fundamental concept of peace-keeping must be moved away, in physical as well as psychological terms, to a terrain different from where we were once domiciled and comfortable. It does not begin and end with our grouch against the inadequacies of our security system, but must extend to an appreciation of the fact that the system has to be updated as a matter of urgency, to a level of competency. This would involve both the citizens and the officials who have to cooperate by recognizing that the change is for the benefit of all. And so, the members of the public must learn, very quickly, to imbibe a culture of patience, for instance at check points, and the security personnel must carry out their duties with efficiency matched by courtesy. The injection of foreign experts into the overall efforts can only bring appreciable profit in the end. It will provide immediate relief and sustained sufficiency in confronting the enemy. All the same, the ultimate benefit will be in the awareness that Nigerians themselves must bear the burden of their own security and safety. In one of the Northern States, the carrying of hand bags in public is now prohibited. This for the fear that such might be used to transport a bomb. Over the week-end, a Lagos State Local Government was gripped by panic over an object which was mistaken for an incendiary device. Happily, it turned out to be something else. At the beginning of this week, the National Assembly was evacuated by a bomb scare which, at the end, was nothing short of a hoax. It is to the credit of the honorable members, men and women, that they retained their composure and filed out in good order. We must shake off this mantle of insecurity which the Boko Haram has cast around our shoulders as a nation. the viper sting The Speaker of the Lagos State House of Assembly, Adeyemi Ikuforiji, was arrested and detained by the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission recently \u2013 and there hangs a tale or two. In the first place, the EFCC\u2019s action was said to have been in response to a petition forwarded to it , alleging that the Speaker had defrauded his government by a tidy sum of money running into millions, pardon me, billions of naira. (No one, but the most handicapped of public servants, misappropriates mere millions these days.) There was also a \u201crider\u201d about a criminal record that should have been disclosed before now to the appropriate authorities. The three-term speaker has, of course, vehemently denied all the allegations. In any case, we are not really concerned about all that. Of more concern to us is the method of investigation of a crime which has now become the norm in our criminal system. A simple petition against anyone, no matter how upstanding he is in the community, is enough to have him \u201cinvestigated\u201d by being dragged to the police station, and not quietly either. He is inflicted with the trauma of the negative publicity which should be experienced by only those whose indictments had been examined and deemed to have a case to answer. Without being charged to court, he is made to go through the inconvenience and humiliation of someone already arraigned. It used to be that investigations were conducted without any unnecessary assault on the dignity of those involved. Now they are kept in durance vile for hours, and sometimes in violation of their fundamental human rights under the law, just because of a written accusation which, in fact should be the object of primary investigation, in the first place. This has to improve, especially since some of these petitions are authored by faceless monsters, writing under horrid names like \u201cconcerned citizens\u201d. They are usually granted impunity despite the anxiety, grief and worry they might have piled on the head of an innocent man. It would at least serve as a deterrent if they are sanctioned whenever their allegations are found to be false and based on malice or sheer mischief. Anyway, let us thrash around a bit in the muddy waters of Lagos State politics. In the case of Speaker Ikuforiji, the identity of his accuser was said to have been unconcealed.. The man is himself a politician, a former member of the Lagos State cabinet, Muis Banire. Now, hereby lies another tale. The former Lagos State Governor, Asiwaju Bola Tinubu, recently seemed to be all for the replacement of Babatunde Raji Fashola, his successor in office. Governor Fashola\u2019s offence was never publicly disclosed, though some people felt it was a case of \u201cpersonal politics\u201d.(That translates crudely into \u201cjealousy\u201d.) Anyway, it was a poorly concealed secret that Tinubu wanted Fashola a few paces away from the governor\u2019s seat. It would not then be amiss to associate a petition that was raised against Fashola\u2019s administration with that desire. And guess whom he was said to have wanted as a replacement? None other than his prot\u00e9g\u00e9, Muis Banire who was then in Fashola\u2019s cabinet. Furthermore, the proponent of the removal of Fashola was our dear Speaker Ikuforiji, who insisted adamantly, that Governor Fashola should be probed by the House, over the allegations contained in the petition against the governor. It took no less than a court order to turn the Speaker around. So it would appear that there was a time when Adeyemi Ikuforiji and Muis Banire, must have been \u201cpally-pally\u201d over the mutual fell purpose of getting Babatunde Raji Fashola out of the Governor\u2019sd seat in Lagos State. That was when the going was good. Now the whole repast appears to have turned sour. And, as for our former bantam Speaker, if you ask me, it couldn\u2019t have happened to a nicer guy. How does it feel when the shoe is on the other foot? That is as far as we shall go in this episode. I am sure you know the rest. But if you would like to delve into the \u201cwhys and wherefores\u201d as the lawyers say (and all of them, barring Ashiwaju Bola Tinubu, are lawyers, by the way) tune in, same time, same station, next week. Time out. Related",

        "title": "A letter to Goodluck Jonathan",
        "author": "Obi Nwakanma",
        "text": "By Obi Nwakanma Dear Dr. Jonathan. I greet you in the name of the Republic. I hope we still have a republic to speak of, seeing that over the years, the foundational republican idea on which this nation was negotiated and founded in the various rounds of constitutional conferences leading to independence has been fundamentally eroded. It has been eroded by the unique attempts to redefine the terms of the being of this nation by the various interests, on the one hand by conservative monarchists who are bound by a blind regard for \"tradition\"\u009d and on the other hand by feeble voiced republicans, who are guided by the enlightened idea that all men are born free and equal. That in a modern republic such as was endowed to us at independence, there are neither kings nor peasants. Only citizens subject to the laws of the state. There should be no space for \"ancient\"\u009d kingdoms and principalities and no royal highnesses in the republic. It would be like having two captains in the ship of state. There should only be the parliament of the people constituted as the voice of the people with elected citizens speaking for their fellow citizens in a body of peers. But as you see, Nigeria is a ridiculous nation, and seems driven by two spirits \"\u201c one of an incommensurate past of dead kingdoms struggling to reclaim their being and the other is of a modern nation, uncertain of its future \"\u201c and all these make Nigeria a schizophrenic state with schizoid identity. Nigeria's national schizophrenia manifests clearly in the situation that has thrown you up as \"acting President\"\u009d of the Federal Republic of Nigeria. It threw up a situation, which more than any other period dramatized the fact very forcefully to any keen watcher that Nigeria's sovereignty is a terrible lie. Nigeria is trapped between the East and the West \u2013 between Mecca and Washington DC; between the dreams of a new Ottoman Empire and the bulwark of the Trilateral Commission. We the people now increasingly feel like mere numbers, victims of a chess game whose moves we can neither understand at the moment nor control. I feel an urgent need, however, to address you in your new capacity as the chief of state, acting or not. I wish to draw your attention to the possibilities that your current position presents to you to make a most radical contribution to the process of change in Nigeria. You have less than one year to complete the term of this administration which you have inherited. You must cast your minds back and see the hands of providence. Those who believe in God might in fact say, that God is intent on using you to right the course of this floundering republic, institute the rules of a just order, and wipe the tears of the oppressed. I will keep it secular, Dr. Jonathan, and suggest that you were born of humble circumstances; you have tasted both sides of the Nigerian condition, and you must not forget the millions of Nigerians trapped in the ghettoes, living in some of the worst conditions on earth. You must not forget your own frustrations as a research scientist working without tools, yet aware of the many trapped geniuses dreaming of using their skills to transform the social and material conditions of our society. You have been thrown into the circumstance of privilege, but the great mark of a man of distinction is the capacity and willingness to use power and privilege for the greatest common good. To understand that every call to service is a privilege by which we either endow posterity \"\u201c your children and those who will survive them \"\u201c with the greatest gift, a memorable name, or the worst, to be associated with villainy. As you know, Nigerians have placed a curse, and many die still cursing certain names of people who have known great power and who have used it to great ill and disservice to Nigeria. You must choose where you want to be consigned: among the dung of history or on the plinth of immemorial heroes of this republic. I would like to point out, as I end this letter to you, Dr. Jonathan that, you have in my view taken an initial wrong step in the choice of your ministers. It is a ministerial list that recycles the same old, same old crutches and hangers-on, and it seems as though ministerial appointments in Nigeria have more than ever become something of party-favors and not based on any conceptual clarity. Perhaps it speaks to the rather fraught nature of this republic, but Nigeria does not need 36 ministers! The United States of America for example does not have up to 36 ministers in government. Indeed, the US operates with 15 cabinet secretaries (ministers) and if you add six cabinet-level advisers to the president, a total of 19 cabinet positions that run the government of the United States. We must of course bear in mind that one state in America \"\u201c the state of Texas alone \"\u201c is bigger than N igeria, and that fact ought to instruct us about the folly of our enterprise. Nigeria needs only eight cabinet ministers and four total cabinet level advisers to the president. You have an urgent task to reform the structure of Nigeria's state administration for effective delivery of services and a reduction in the massive waste of scarce resources to service the mostly hollow rituals of federal ministries that have become mostly pits of corruption and troughs of patronage. There seems to be a fog on the purpose, and an incontinence that largely characterizes this nation, and Nigerians feel a sense of powerful drift and purposelessness. Democracy has not earned them the benefits of good, independent and sovereign government, the freedom and prosperity so much hoped for. It's now your call, Mr. president to make it up to Nigerians. I thank you. Related",

        "text": "By Kola Animashaun I could not believe it is six years ago that we met at your office at Centre for Constitutional Governance at Ilupeju on the eve of a \u2018town meeting\u2019 taking place at the Airport Hotel Ikeja. There I sought your permission to be allowed to speak after your invited speakers might have aired their views against or in support of the Constitutional Conference of Chief Olusegun Obasanjo planned early for 2006. As we were discussing, you received two faxed messages from your invited speakers from the north, expressing their inability to make the events scheduled for the next day. In effect you and the organisers were all left with an all southern Nigerian speakers to shoot down the conference as a third term bid by then president. It was in the course of our animated discussion that I advised you see your physician, which you responded in the affirmative that you were due for a health check-up immediately after the town meeting. You indeed left for the check-up, came back to \u2018recuperate\u2019 for the \u2018assignment\u2019. Alas, the information I had was a phone call from a friend a couple of weeks later that \u201cDotun, your egbon, Beko has passed away\u201d, on the 10th of Feb, 2006 which made me change my course that morning: to your Imaria Close residence to commiserate and signed the condolence register. Doctor, I once asked, when did you take to activism and abandon patient-doctor relationship, having intimated you of watching your live discussion program anchored by Danladi Bako on NTA 2 Channel 5, involving your good self, Alao Aka-Bashorun, Prof Alaba Ogunsanwo and two others. The idea of a NATIONAL CONFERENCE OR DIALOGUE was muted in early 1990. Your retort was that efforts to discuss the National Question having been scuttled by then military administration, the annulment of 1993 election won \u2018freely and squarely by Bashorun Moshood Abiola in the words of Mallam Adamu Ciroma. Ciroma later described the South West as crying \u2018like rain beaten chicken\u2019. You are being roped into a coup plot, and sentenced to jail by the Abacha administration. Now in Feb, 2006, the drum of National Dialogue/Conference or its variant National Sovereign Conference was now drumming louder than hitherto; the drum is about bursting with dire consequence for our dear nation. With a structure inherited from the colonialist, like in the rest of Africa, rather than create a welfare society we have only succeed in creating a warfare society. Is the present structure of governance serving us optimally? Are the supporting institutions working and present political systems working to bringing out the best in us to engender socio- economic growth and development? We are only called Federal in name only, \u2018federalising heinous acts\u2019 like robberies, political corruptions, criminalization of politics for the sole aims of \u2018naked accumulation of power\u2019. You were born like your other sibling into activism, your parents fought injustices and inequality in the land. In the latter course of your life you committed the energy imbued you by God to the cause of fighting human rights abuses; you went to jails and passed on to eternity in activism without letting up. The Lagos State government have erected a park with a life statue of the quintessential Beko\u2019s poise; with a hand in the pocket ruminating over the next move as a memorial. Alas, a heart rending event in form of a protest ostensibly against fuel price hike took place in the land at Ojota, Lagos. Gani Fawehinmi Memorial Park in Lagos where elements of civil societies, labour and other decided to \u2018occupy Nigeria\u2019 \u2013 an allusion to the current fad in the west where discontented youths are protesting. A fad that we need to de-link from, and embrace the essence of our beings by looking inwards to our culture. You will be so amused by the various reactions that the protests elicited across the lands; that the South West are now in cahoot with the North West to protest again the regime of a South-Southerners, while South -East seem unconcerned as it looks like they have lost interest in protecting Nigeria as presently constituted. Instead of supporting the transformation agenda of President Goodluck Jonathan, a \u2018shoeless boy\u2019 in his own words, who strings good-lucks, have \u2018catapulted\u2019 to the presidency from Otuoke in Bayelsa and whose mantra is TRANSFORMATION. Could this be a case of Nigeria National Dialogue by other means? That your comrades who were so enamoured of SELF DETERMNINATION agenda a couple of years back whose mantra was then encapsulated in \u2018osa ti o ba le gbemi ko fi mi sile bo ti bami , are now seeking A REGIME CHANGE or POWER, to continue status quo by other mean. Your Campaign for Democracy ably led by erstwhile Secretary Joe was at the fore front supported by the hubby who has a transformed experience in recent times. He was spokesperson of Afenifere and moved to that of the pretender group, Afenifere Renewal Group and ending up as a spokesperson for a conservative political party Congress Party for Change with Rtd Gen Mohammed Buhari. There was\u2019 prophetic\u2019 pastor Tunde Bakare founder of Save Nigeria Group as vice-presidential candidate, with your indefatigable and irrepressible Femi Falana not founding wanting.

        "text": "By Kola Animashaun Tribute From Oludotun Malomo I am now seeing the fruits of your labour at the Yoruba Constitution Group along with other patriots coming to fruition. The work for self-determination, the frequent trips for the Igbimo Omo Oduduwa meetings in Ibadan. It was a framework for a Yoruba Constitution, within or without the Nigerian state, which was sent to Nigeria Political Reform Conference in Abuja in early 2006 becoming the irreducible position for our Yoruba nationality in the nationalities conference, to save the fate of the Nigerian nation state. The grievances in the land are so demanding that we have taken the road to Afghanistan rather the one to Denmark. Suicide bombings are now the order in a section of the polity, even the UN building in Abuja had not been spared, with precious lives lost. Security services formations have not been exempted from suicide bomb attacks. If you remember, I made an appearance on Kaakaki, the early morning AIT discussion programme, to talk on then President Obasanjo Constitution conference, where I said I was not seeing the election of 2007, but something much deeper than that. Alas the restructuring attempt was aborted under the guise of A THIRD TERM ATTEMPT by the incumbent president. In the course of the Kaakaki programme, I said in respect of Obasanjo, he had three choices waiting for him and his dear Nigeria: that he could choose to be a Marshal Tito, that partisan of 2nd world war who put together disparate set of people in Eastern Europe and rule them with iron hand, but on his passing, despite attempts at six co-presidencies, his Yugoslavia disintegrated in a bitter civil war. A Comrade Breshenev, who on becoming the General Secretary of the Soviet party politburo, instituted glasnost that swept him out of power and broke up the Soviet State. Finally, a General Charles De-Gaulle, a partisan of Free French movement of 2nd world war who was called on severally to save the French State in 1958. He gave the French a new constitution and new political order that the nation is still regaling in. My comprehension then was, the Obasanjo that I know would choose the De-Gaulle, model but the rest is recent history. Election did take place in 2007 and power returned to the North with President\u2019s Umar Musa Yar\u2019Adua, erstwhile governor of Katsina State and junior brother who unfortunately lost his life in hasty circumstances in prison. But mid-term to the new government the president took ill and the macabre dance of the Nigerian state were instituted that it took \u201ca doctrine of necessity\u201d whatever it is for the vice- president from South-south to be sworn in as acting president. Those who shot down Constitutional Conference revelled in their pyrrhic victory not \u2018cunning\u2019 of the saying \u201ceepa para e, o ni o un pa aja\u201d In Nigeria, are we having a clash of civilisations as posited by Samuel Huntington, where cultural values of the different societies in our colonial amalgam are expressing themselves to unravel the exploiting existing order? Could it just be political decay, where existing political systems, and institutions are encouraging polarisation, thus becoming less legitimate? Whatever it is, could this be the end of history for Nigeria as a nation state? Dear egbon, it is the national conference that the elite, have denied calling the past two decades, but now playing itself out in our daily occurrence, \u201ciyan odun merin o si gbona feli feli\u201d. Could this be end of history for Nigeria as a nation state? Your Aburo, Oludotun Malomo AbdulKareem Adisa \u2013 RIP Today, I remember a young friend of mine. AKD died February 17th 2005 at London hospital Friday February 25th and was buried February 27th 2005. He died in a ghastly accident. A K Adisa was a General in the Nigerian Army. He would not know how far he would have gone. AKD was colourful whatever you care to think about it. You may say, you could not deny where he stood. Abacha said he joined the so-called coup and Abacha said he should be killed. Like the phoenix, he rose from his own ashes. AKD acknowledged me as senior brother and treated me as such. Even in captivity he sent his regards to me when I had an accident, no wonder I missed him. AKD and Taju Olanrenwaju were prominent in the PDP. I would not know what role Oladipo Diya played in the party. But I did not know whether they profited from it. They had clemency and Obasanjo had everything including pardon. Obasanjo ought to have afforded them pardon; Yar\u2019 Adua and Goodluck did not. And they know the difference between clemency and pardon. They know (Taju & Oladipo) what they are losing. AK Adisa may not know the difference. Related",

        "title": "A letter to Yushau Shuaib",
        "author": "None",
        "text": "MY dear Yushau Shuaib, first accept my sincere sympathy for your recent travails. I am happy to glean from your narration syndicated in several newspapers that you were not, after all, fired, but redeployed from the National Emergency Management Agency, NEMA, to the Ministry of Information. I first read about your travails from some columnists. I must confess that their treatment of the subject put me off. They followed the currently popular logic; if it is the Federal Government, it must be the wrong party; if it is a public official, he or she must be guilty even without proof; and if it is Dr. Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala or Stella Odua, cover her, not with the blood of Jesus, but with the murkiest grime! I am just telling you why I was put off by a few of those who commented on your case. They were simply on their high horses egging you with this \u201cfreedom of speech\u201d and \u201cdemocratic society\u201d lines that seem to be cover for all manner of incivility. This letter is not about whatever you wrote about the Honourable Minister of Finance. After reading your syndicated explanation I asked myself whether it was an answer to a query, an apology to your establishment, NEMA, an apology to Dr. Okonjo-Iweala or just a deliberate enlistment of the community of Public Affair analysts. After going through it over and over, I concluded that you were simply a victim of a society that has lost its institutional memory. This loss of institutional memory has contributed to the rot we are in today. We have forgotten the proper way of doing things. We have destroyed every known ethos. Those who are supposed to be custodians of the fine ethics that served us in the past are either ignorant themselves or too preoccupied with other interests to care. I say this because nobody, including those egging you on with \u201cfreedom of speech\u201d has given the slightest regard to the fact that YOU ARE A CIVIL SERVANT! And in the civil service there are dos and don\u2019ts; there are channels for addressing vertical and horizontal relationships; there are ways of exercising your \u201cfree speech\u201d different from the way a non-civil servant would! I am not sure that what galled Dr. Okonjo-Iweala was so much of what you accused her of as the channel you chose to address her! The choice of channel is what was objectionable to her and I can tell you my brother, it is unacceptable for a civil servant. You were at that time, an image maker for a Federal establishment. Federal Government is one. You were not expected to be inside and pee inside; your job as image maker means you pee outside. You wrote: \u201cWhen I moved to the Federal Civil Service I never stopped writing\u201d. That is not the issue. The subjects of your obviously copious writings are not the issue either. What mattered was, who you were addressing at any particular time and HOW did you choose to address the person. I just suspect that nobody has ever advised you that when it comes to criticising any arm of the government you serve, being a civil servant imposes a limitation on you. I am sure the civil service habours thousands of other fine writers who could hold their own. Many of them have become much sought-after columnists after their civil service career. But they did not engage in histrionic social criticism as civil servants. Let me narrate to you a personal experience. I was a young officer of Customs of Excise in 1976 when Alhaji Shehu Musa, Makaman Nupe, who had done a tour before as Administrative Secretary, came back as Director General of Customs and Excise. He came to Apapa Port, where I was the branch President of the Customs Union, to address staff. He said that he would welcome suggestions that could help his reorganisation of the Customs. He said his office was open 24 hours for such suggestions. So I wrote what I thought should be the new outlook of the PR Department, took the ferry to Marina, walked to Mosaic House and dropped it in Shehu Musa\u2019s office. Several weeks later, the Chief Collector in charge of Apapa sent for me. You wrote that you were \u201celated\u201d and \u201cjubilant\u201d when the Minister of Finance telephoned you! And in a typical kiss-and-tell journalism that obtains, you even went to town with it. That is indecorous. When I was asked to go and see the Chief Collector, my stomach churned. Ten thousand rattle snakes played rugby in my spine. You don\u2019t get summoned by the Principal Collector or Chief Collector unless it is a serious matter. When I literally crawled into his office, the first reassuring sign that I was not in serious trouble was that he was not scowling. So I began to breathe again. He reached under a file, pulled out a letter\u2014the butterflies again\u2014and said, \u201cyoung man, congratulations! I don\u2019t know what you wrote, but this is a letter of commendation for you from the DG!\u201d Now my effort did not earn me only a letter of commendation, it also earned me a stern rebuke for not routing my memo through my bosses at Apapa, which is the appropriate channel to the DG. The Chief Collector warned me of the serious infraction of the General Orders that was. I just apologised and left. Months after, as a result of the reorganisation, the DG instructed that I be redeployed to Headquarters in the PR department where Chief Alex Akinyele (Baba rere) was the Czar! On the morning that I reported, Chief Akinyele completely excoriated me for not routing a copy of my memo to his office since he is the one in charge of PR Department. My lame excuse that he was not by boss then did not wash. There were ways things were done in the civil service then. There were ways civil servants comported themselves and addressed superiors, no matter the vexation. And the General Order, GO, was rigidly guarded and followed. That was why the civil service was able to hold this country together from 29 July to 1 September 1966 when this country had no government! Then the military came and ruined everything. The GO must go. I don\u2019t know what they have in the Civil Service Rules that replaced it and how many civil servants have seen it or even care about what it says. That was what I meant by loss of institutional memory. My brother, let nobody egg you on to ruin what I can see is a promising career both as a civil servant and as a writer. As a spokesman for a Federal Parastatal, I am sure you could have availed yourself of access to several Government Offices. I believe that if, at the worst, you had gone to the Ministry of Finance with a memo, and had audience with your colleague there and said, there are unsavoury things being said about the Hon. Minister and that you felt so concerned that you would appreciate it if they addressed the matter, your plight would not be what it is today. I want to believe you when you say that your article was not intended to embarrass the Hon. Minister. But the way it has worked out, you even inadvertently succeeded in embarrassing your own boss at NEMA and could have put his job on the line. Don\u2019t ever listen to anybody who lionises you that you can be a civil servant and also be a fiery activist at the same time. Ask anybody who tells you that what he thinks would be your fate if you worked in, say, Nigeria Airforce, and wrote that about a General in the Army or Navy. And let me tell you this. Our society has lost it manners and now it is about to lose its mind. Your responsibility as a fine writer is to help this society retrieve those values that made us great in the past which this generation about to take over does not care about any more! If you must be part of that recovery, then, you must not lose your head. By the way, I cut my journalism teeth in Lagos Weekend while I was an officer of Customs; young, flighty, Lucky Strike-smoking and a Fela devotee. Although I wrote hilarious commentaries on our societal foibles I dared not even do it with my real name. Indicating whether it was in my private capacity or not could not have made sense, because if anybody wanted to, he could accuse me of conflict of interest and all he needed to prove it was to show that Daily Times paid me for my articles. So I started experimenting with the brand called PINI JASON. And I did not go to Daily Times to collect the stipends until I was about to resign from Customs. My dear, learn your lesson from this and built a solid civil service career for yourself or come join us in this divide. You can\u2019t walk on both sides of the road at the same time! Related",

        "author": "Donu Kogbara",
        "text": "By Donu Kogbara I WAS abducted from my Port Harcourt residence by armed men on Sunday August 30\u2026and released nearly two weeks later on Friday September 11. It was a horrific experience overall. The loss of freedom was hard to bear. The primitive hut in which I was incarcerated was extremely uncomfortable and full of mosquitos and sand flies. A large rat emerged from Lord knows where when darkness fell. I was regularly threatened; and I frequently feared for my life. Donu Kogbara with the Rivers CP, Mr Musa Kimo at her PH residence after her release by kidnappers I was assured that I would be murdered or maimed if my family and friends did not deliver a juicy ransom payment\u2026and if security personnel attempted to rescue me. I was also told that I would get caught in crossfire if a rival gang of kidnappers tried to \u201csteal\u201d me. Rival gang of kidnappers And there were times when some of my jailors angrily lashed out and accused me of being a fully-fledged member of a greedy and uncaring Establishment that steals public funds and cheats the masses. But it has to be said that I was also treated kindly sometimes. Within any group, there will be different personality types; and some of my young captors \u2013 there were eight of them \u2013 were nicer than others; and, to be fair, even the worst of them possessed humane streaks and senses of humour. They didn\u2019t hesitate to purchase blood pressure medication for me when I told them that I was hypertensive, bought me (without any prompting) warm clothes so I wouldn\u2019t feel cold during the chilly creek nights, gave me a Bible to read, teased me for being an \u201cOyinbo Woman\u201d and laughed when I told them that if they killed me, I would come back as a ghost and haunt them\u2026and that I was so troublesome on occasion that some of my friends would pay them to keep me. They regularly offered me food, drink and cigarettes. Some of them addressed me respectfully or affectionately as \u201cMadame\u201d or \u201cMummy\u201d and apologised for kidnapping me and said that they had only turned to crime because they couldn\u2019t get jobs. And we had quite a few cordial and stimulating conversations about their dreams, my overseas travels, elections, cooking and many other topics. They complained about being betrayed by various Niger Deltan militant leaders and various mainstream politicians. They said they were waging a war against \u201cBig Men\u201d who had used and dumped them\u2026and \u201cchopped\u201d their money. Stockholm Syndrome, or capture-bonding, is a psychological phenomenon in which hostages develop positive feelings toward their captors, sometimes to the point of defending and identifying with them. Given that I have always been a Niger Deltan advocate and activist of sorts who has long worried about neglected Niger Deltan youths, I wasn\u2019t surprised when I started to emphatise with \u201cThe Boys\u201d, as they liked to describe themselves. So though I went through phases of bitterly resenting them for hurting me and turning me into a helpless and humiliated hostage, I also went through phases of feeling sorry for them and regarding them as victims of a dysfunctional society. Functional society I persuaded myself to believe that most of them were basically benign and essentially harmless. I persuaded myself to believe that I might have become a gun-toting kidnapper/robber myself if I had been born male and impoverished. I persuaded myself to believe that most of them would be transformed into law-abiding citizens if they were given a chance to improve themselves and earn reasonable sums legally. And I begged them to abandon their dangerous and sadistic occupation and find alternative ways of earning their daily crusts. I also found myself wishing that I would one day be in a position to help them. Now that I have been liberated from a proximity that made me emotionally bond with my captors but was \u2013 when all is said and done \u2013 enforced, traumatic and frightening, I have a considerably less sentimental attitude towards them. I still understand why they became outlaws and I am grateful to them for returning my phones and my passport and for not shooting me; but some kidnappings go wrong and end tragically; and I cannot approve of the choices they\u2019ve made or the misery they inflict on abductees and their families. The Boys told me that there were about 30 different kidnapping gangs in Port Harcourt and I am very upset about the fact that I now feel so unsafe in my home town, that I hastily left it last week and I am not likely to return. Kidnapping has become an epidemic in Rivers State and the Niger Delta in general and is becoming increasingly common in other parts of the country (former presidential candidate, Chief Olu Falae, was recently grabbed in Ondo and later released). Federal authorities One can only urge the security agencies, state governments and Federal authorities to up their game and stamp out this evil trade by eradicating poverty and adopting a more robust stance towards crime prevention. Let me also seize this opportunity to thank, from the bottom of my heart, the many Nigerian and foreign individuals and organisations that expressed concern when I disappeared, demanded or facilitated my release and kindly lavished love, concern and practical support on me when I emerged from my ordeal: *Uncle Sam Amuka, the Publisher of Vanguard newspapers; *The Rivers State Commissioner of Police, Musa Kimo; *Rotimi Chibuike Amaechi, the former Governor of Rivers State; *Chief Nyesom Wike, the current Rivers State Governor, and Kenneth Kobani, the Secretary to the Rivers State Government; *APC Women in Rivers State and APC official spokesperson, Chris Finebone; *Ogoni journalists associations and Ledum Mitee, the former head of the Movement for the Survival of the Ogoni People, MOSOP; *PEN International, which is based in London, has 149 centres worldwide and promotes freedom of expression for professional writers. Plus SEVERAL others who do not wish to be publicly acknowledged. Related",

        "text": "By Muyiwa Adetiba The swift way the perpetrators of the \u2018face book\u2019 murder of Cynthia Osokogu were brought to book, brought huge relief to all of us, and, if truth be told, more than a little pride. But more importantly, it brought closure and allowed the friends and family of the poor lady and to some extent, the larger society, to also have closure and move on with their lives. That is how it should be. A crime is committed, the perpetrators are apprehended, justice is done, the society learns from it, and moves on. Sadly, this is more of an exception than the rule. We all know, if we live in this country, that most crimes are poorly investigated if investigated at all. In the course of an investigation, (should any be done) crude violence and high handedness often replace patient intelligence gathering. The result is that wrong persons more often than not, are arrested and charged. Prosecution is another thing. Have you ever seen a police prosecutor at work? I have and its not pretty. To see some police prosecutors being cross-examined, has to be one of the most embarrassing things around, even in this country where nothing shocks. He is so badly prepared that a charge-and-bail lawyer would twist him around his little fingers. The result? Crime\u2014 both high and low profile ones\u2014remain largely unsolved. Last week was the anniversary of the murder of Dele Giwa. That of Chief Bola Ige is another two months away. I was sufficiently close to the two of them to remember their passing away with pain. Always with pain. The first colleague to phone me when I was about to start my publication was the late Dele Giwa. \u2018Lets have breakfast together and talk about your publication\u2019, he said.\u2019I don\u2019t want you to make the kind of mistakes we made.\u2019 I still remember those words, just as I remember his offer to foot my accommodation bill if I could attend a printing exhibition with him in Germany. He was a warm and generous being. I saw him a week to his gruesome death, and he was so full of life and plans for his beloved Newswatch. Because his murder has been unresolved, none of us\u2014his colleagues, friends, and family\u2014have not had any closure. The same thing with Uncle Bola Ige; he was one of the few people I know that high office never changed. I had been around him in and out of office, and he was always himself, unaffected by high office. A very cerebral man, he surrounded himself with young men who could stimulate him. His simplicity, was probably why he was so easily killed. I spoke to him a couple of weeks before he was murdered. He told me he was resigning from government and that we should talk. The \u2018talk\u2019 never took place. He was good to me, and, like Giwa, difficult to forget. Between these two unresolved murders were also many high profile political killings. You tend to think the police do not have the capacity or the will to investigate crime. A recent conversation with a newly retired Commissioner of Police leads me to believing the former. The retired commissioner wanted a crime in which he was involved, investigated. To his utter surprise and annoyance, the investigating police officer (IPO) asked for mobilisation money. My friend tried to pull rank by calling a more senior officer who instantly apologised and promised to look into it. After a half hearted attempt to \u2018investigate\u2019, the matter \u2018died\u2019. I laughed inwardly when he told me the story. He had just been given a dosage of what most of us have been swallowing for years. What goes around, they say, comes around. Are these junior officers being sleazy and greedy or are they in truth, insufficiently mobilised? In other words, how much money is being devoted to crime intelligence, prevention, and detection? A police force is not a police force if it can not prevent, detect, and prosecute crime. The 2013 budget has allocated a hefty sum to the police force\u2014ostensibly to fight Boko Haram. It will be money misapplied\u2014 apologies to a former Vice President\u2014if the raison d\u2019etre of a police force, is again ignored. The policy that allows a junior detective to fund crime investigation from his salary before reimbursement (if any) is a wrong one. A policy that plays down data gathering and forensic intelligence in this day and age, is a wrong one. So is a policy that does not focus on training and retraining, of detectives. It\u2019s not the quantum of ammunition purchased (contracts for the boys?) that will make the people sleep with their two eyes closed. It does not, in the end , matter whether we have Federal Police, State Police, or Village Police. What the people want, and deserve, is an effective Police. Then, and only then, will the friends and families of Dele Giwa and Uncle Bola Ige and others who were brutishly cut down, have closure and their souls really rest in peace. Related",

        "text": "I no talk am? Barely had her body been lowered into the grave that her erstwhile \u2018husband\u2019 who reportedly stormed out of the funeral ceremony because the sitting arrangements were not to his liking wants to publish a tell all book about Whitney\u2026 low-life! Once again, a o ni ba olori buruku pade! Enough said. Way before the Lekki toll gate brouhaha I had given that axis a wide berth; the construction and the traffic fallout just made the very thought of going there tedious. Then when they started collecting the toll, I said fine! Thankfully, the few friends I have in the area are very understanding, plus we now have Ikeja Shopping Mall so abeg make everybody hold in side. It would have to be serious business that would send me in that direction. Finally, serious business came calling and it was time to bite the bullet and head up for Lekki. With memories of endless traffic lines I set out at 11am for a 3pm appointment not wanting to leave anything to chance. I was pleasantly surprised. It was a pretty enjoyable ride; it was great to see what man can work when inspired. I still remember the narrow two lanes that were Lekki express way barely what, three, four years ago? The road was free and wide open, at that time of the day there was very little traffic except those little bottlenecks created by danfos that stop abruptly and park haphazardly anywhere they please. My first encounter with the toll gate itself and its operators wasn\u2019t unpleasant either. They were polite and took my money with a smile. Everything was nice\u2026 very \u2018suburban\u2019. What wasn\u2019t suburban and which came as a mild surprise to me though was the attitude of a lot of people as they approached the toll gates. Believe it or not people were forming double lanes and attempting to shunt their way forward. It didn\u2019t matter that they were mostly SUV\u2019s we could have been in the heart of Mushin or Oshodi (before it was cleared) given the way some were driving. It just brought home to me again how thoughtless, selfish and disrespectful the average Nigerian is. Nothing captures and exposes these traits like the way we drive on our roads. Transplant these same people to any foreign land and they will follow the rules to the letter. They are polite, soft-spoken, obedient and well mannered. Once they\u2019re back home, all of that just disappears into thin air. Why is our disdain so potent for Nigeria and all things Nigerian? Back in the day when Nigeria Airways was still in existence, there was this return trip to Nigeria from London that was so surreal I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve been able to properly describe it to this day. This flight had been cancelled twice before so you can imagine the backlog of passengers and how on edge people were. Right from the checking queue at Heathrow you could tell we were Nigerians. It was like an island of madness with people shoving and pushing and yelling at the top of their voices. Even after we shoved and kicked our way on board the madness didn\u2019t stop. I kid you not; it took the pilot the better part of like 10-20minutes to get people in their seats so we could prepare for take-off. What were they doing? They were jisting and simply carrying on like we were in the market square! One man in particular remained standing in the aisle for several minutes leisurely flipping through his newspaper completely oblivious to voice (getting more frazzled by the minute) demanding- nay begging \u2013 us to settle down so we could prepare for take-off. I couldn\u2019t believe what I was seeing\u2026 we could have been in a molue in the middle of Idumota for all our carryings on. Did I mention that two people actually came to physical blows while we were airborne? And did I mention how filthy the plane was by the time we landed in Lagos? Totally surreal I tell you. Seems to me the reason we constantly get stuck with bad leadership is that we ourselves have not come to equity with clean hands. We cannot attempt to hold these people accountable in the big things while we are found wanting in the little things. I think we all individually and collectively need to reassess what our expectations are concerning this nation and act accordingly. Related",

        "author": "Les Leba",
        "text": "By Les Leba The membership of an association such as a Nation State implies an inherent social contract between the individual and a geopolitical organ of Administration. In return for the improved welfare, peace and security which the Nation State will provide, the individual agrees to forfeit certain rights of freedom to the sovereign nation to which he or she belongs. The premise of a reasonable access to food, shelter and security and the opportunity for the satisfaction of the sublime need of self actualization make membership of a nation state a more attractive option than a state of proliferation of sovereign individuals. However, when the reasonable expectations of the people in a nation state are unreachable, then the behaviour of members of that nation state will become aberrant; in other words, there would be a lack of motivation and a reluctance to abide with the protocol and rules that should encourage progress and enhance the security of the peoples of the Sovereign Geopolitical entity. This downward slide into anarchy will be further propelled when the system of work and reward becomes skewed in favour of the idle and parasitic elements in the Society. Regrettably, our beloved country, Nigeria now finds itself in these dangerous straits. The nation, now finds itself with a growing population of unemployed and consequently disenfranchised citizens. The practice of agriculture, our traditional erstwhile source of sustainable existence has given way to a process of rural to urban migration that has not only succeeded in poisoning the security and stability of the urban areas but has also depleted the availability of the food and grains harvested from the Rural Economy. In which event, we have heavy unemployment in the urban areas and increasing unemployed arable land without the complement of adequate labour to produce food for an increasing population! The dangerous signals posed by the above scenario are made more alarming by the discontent amongst the currently \u2018gainfully\u2019 employed labour force. Indeed, with the exception of workers in the Banking, Oil and Gas industries, it is fair to say that the current salary packages of workers in all other sectors of the economy are insufficient and inadequate to sustain their loyalty to the Social Contract with the Nigerian nation. In the absence of official statistics on wages and National employment, it would be a fair guestimate to expect that over 50% of the employed labour force in Nigeria would earn below N 30,000 per month while about 70% of the same labour force would earn less that N 50,000 per month! For example, you would have to be a graduate with over 10 years experience in the civil service to earn a salary of about N 50,000/month (N 600,000 a year). Meanwhile, such an accomplished loyal employee would expectedly want a good educational foundation for his children. In view of the decaying quality of education in government sponsored educational institutions, our dedicated middle level Civil Servant would inevitably enroll his wards into private primary and secondary schools, where fees per child could easily approach N 100,000 a year. The penchant of the African for between 2-6 children in each nuclear family would spell disaster for the ability of our middle level Civil Servant to meet his financial obligations. In fact, if a prudent couple chooses to have just two kids, the school books and daily transport for these two kids alone would eat up over N 300,000 from an annual salary package of N 600,000 per year! Meanwhile, the family would still have to feed, and also pay for petrol or daily transportation to and from work, pay for house rent, and be expected to have something left over for health and clothing. There can be no place for one naira of savings in this budget profile! We can imagine the daily stress and agony of such a middle level Civil Servant. In more focussed societies, a degree holder with over 10 years service in the Civil Service would be a home owner and would enjoy social welfare support from his home government. The burden of children\u2019s school fees for the purpose of a sound educational foundation is tolerable and may not exceed 10% of annual income. Mass transportation is facilitated and relatively cheap and personal security and the opportunity for self actualization are enhanced. In the above example, we have looked at a middle level Civil Servant; we can imagine what torture drivers, clerical staff, artisans, technicians, journalists etc, who earn less than N 30,000 per month and constitute possibly over 40% of our labour force have to endure if they have to \u2018live\u2019 within the limits of their real and official income. We must include in this analysis the remuneration package of members of our Security Forces, i.e. Police, Customs, Immigration, etc; these men who are trained and given the responsibility to protect our security and ensure compliance of the citizen with the laws of the land also stew in the same pot of inadequate remuneration. It is clear from the above that we have a pool of employed men and women who readily give their services but discover that they cannot make the proverbial ends to meet. At this juncture, as should be expected, the human impulse for self preservation would rear its head; from then on, it would only require little encouragement (usually from the home front) before an otherwise honest, hardworking and loyal employee grabs the first opportunity that comes along to supplement his meagre income so that his family could maintain some modicum of dignity! Unfortunately, however, a taste of the fruit of compromise soon becomes an addictive pursuit. Once the floodgate of corrupt enrichment is opened, the deluge that follows takes on the magnitude of the devastating instinct of primordial accumulation! The psyche of the perpetrator is gradually modified and what would have earlier been considered as wrong and anti-social behaviour now becomes welcomed as divine blessings! Indeed, religious and traditional thanksgiving services would even be celebrated to thank God for blessing the family of the perpetrators! This is the beginning of the collapse of the work ethic, and the celebration of self over country! This framework is further bolstered by a National revenue sharing policy that also enthrones population and not social or economic contribution as the hallmark for National revenue sharing! The effect of this absurd framework is evident in the disappearance of the erstwhile income generating and the lucrative agrarian economy that was the bedrock of National development in the colonial and immediate post colonial era! The groundnut pyramids have become historical pictures; operating palm oil mills can now be counted on the fingers of both hands, cocoa and rubber plantations have become wild forests once again; meanwhile, the soil and climate that made these agricultural successes possible, remain the same, while our agricultural workforce has migrated in increasing numbers to create problems of urban management and social welfare and security in the urban areas! Meanwhile local political administrators meet on schedule every month to divide the booty of allocations from federal revenue! The net effect of all the above is that the work ethic is destroyed. Why work when you can rely on booty from the centre, and even if you are one of the fortunate ones to be in \u2018gainful employment\u2019 then you are lucky to have secured a desk to supplement your income with graft at the expense of the Company or people you are employed to serve. The same despicable structure now exists, whether in the civil service, the private sector, the police force, the customs service, the Armed Forces and Immigration! How can we be so trusting as to put our safety and the security of our lives and properties in the hands of workers who are underpaid and oftentimes owed a backlog of several months salaries and who are ultimately confronted with the bleak prospect of life after retirement! It is like retraining a cat to stop it from mousing; some would say it is unnatural! Thus, with the integrity of our Security forces compromised by virtue of self preservation, law and order will ultimately break down, justice will become the property of the highest bidder! In this event, the polity from top to bottom can only become more corrupt! The disenfranchised army of unemployed who do not yet have an official platform to feather their nests would have to survive one way or the other in view of the absence of any Social Security net; the harvest of this ill wind is the spate of armed robberies, cultism and the proliferation of criminal thugs, euphemistically referred to as Area Boys in all corners of the country! These Area boys have become so brazen and have graduated to a higher level of cooperation with the law enforcement agencies for mutual survival. The picture painted above should be a wake up call for the government to immediately reassess the Work and Reward ethic system in the Country. There is an urgent need to ensure that a salary structure that would enable the gainfully employed to meet their basic needs without a recourse to supplementary income from graft, egunje, kola, kickback or kickfront or from the \u2018dividends of democracy\u2019 should be implemented to avoid the destabilisation of the centre and halt things from falling apart. \u201cThe above article was first published in July 2005. Now that both Labour and the government have agreed to a national minimum wage of N 18,000, many questions still remain unanswered. It is patently evident that though the new wage level is a far cry from a \u2018realistic\u2019 living wage, Organised Labour will celebrate their success in obtaining the increase, even if the plague of inflation eventually diminishes the real purchasing power. Indeed, Labour may have been better advised to advocate for a stronger naira value than quantum leaps in the wage level. A much stronger naira will mean cheaper fuel prices, lower production costs, lower inflation and inevitably increasing employment, all of which will resound in an echo of a sweeter melody among the ranks of Labour! \u201cThe threat by Labour to thwart the 2011 elections unless the N 18,000 minimum wage is enacted appears rather misplaced; it would have been more appropriate to stand up for improved purchasing value for the naira by insisting that dollar certificates be adopted for the payment of dollar revenue in monthly allocations and for prompt enactment of the freedom of information bill, or indeed, significant reductions in the emoluments of legislators at all levels.\u201d SAVE THE NAIRA, SAVE NIGERIA!

        "text": "By Bisi Lawrence For weeks, my former neighbour was counting the days. Then suddenly, \"It's this weekend, you know\"\u009d, he said with a catch in his voice. \"Yes,\"\u009d I replied. \"Wish I could come with you.\"\u009d That was some four years ago. He was in that state of prolonged excitement about the Redeemed Christian Church of God's Annual Convention. It was a condition of mind I could not share. For one thing, I did not subscribe to \"conventions\"\u009d. A good church service on Sunday, okay; festive occasions of religious significance like the Easter, Christmas or even the Harvest \"\u201c all of that is welcome. But Conventions, and Synods, and what-have-you, one would conveniently leave for the impassioned believer. That was my idea of Christian worship. And of course, miracles and the testimonies they evoke simply leave me only slightly amused. The lame walk, the blind see, the dumb speak, and all that may be all right as revelations of what God can do, and really did do, in the Bible, but I always maintained that I never actually met someone who experienced such wondrous deeds. In fact, I took a dim view of such narratives, just as I could not get too enthusiastic about \"vigils\"\u009d. I described myself as a \"straight\"\u009d Christian, church-going, communion-taking, neighbour-loving. What else do you need? It is not yet up to a year since I began to feel differently. I believe I have written about that change here. It is not anything as earth-shaking as St. Paul's conversion. It was simply a growing awareness of an inward uplifting \"\u201c that is the only way I can describe it; an internal effervescence that fills you with a gripping desire to ascend to a plane of higher thoughts and nobler deeds. And you give yourself to this urge and strive to attain its demands because you are now fully conscious of the fact that attending the church every Sunday, and observing the Easter and Christmas festivities alone simply will not take you there. The urge is the touch of the Holy Spirit of God. Some might call it the \"anointing'. These are statements I would not \"\u201c in fact, could not \"\u201c have made a few years ago. I had not been \"touched\"\u009d then. I would have been reluctant to admit openly that I had established a close relationship with Christ. I mean, it sounds so \"unsophisticated\"\u009d, almost disingenuous. But there is somebody, a university teacher, and a scholar in the rarefied realms of mathematics, who went through the experience and stayed with it. The yearnings of millions of human beings have been fulfilled through his efforts at interpreting and extending that \"touch\"\u009d today. The mission of the church that he heads is to have, at least, one member of every family, and plant churches in every part of the globe. It is a vision he personally and passionately shares, and tirelessly pursues. Many people express a profound surprise about the humility of Pastor Enoch Adeboye at the first meeting. He is so down to earth and yet that is what fuels the awe with which they grow to regard him. After his recent birthday, he recounted that he had no less than five cars among the presents he received, for which he really had no need. And so, he decided to give out those five cars to other people as gifts. At that point, he continued, someone came to offer him yet another car as a birthday present and, this time, it was a Hummer. \"I'm keeping that one\"\u009d, he concluded, nodding engagingly. That is the kind of simplicity and honesty that warms the cockles of people's hearts. At the base of that is the humility of a cleric who chooses a bow-tie in preference to a \"dog-collar\"\u009d, who would rather be \"pastor\"\u009d than bishop or even archbishop, and to whom the planting of churches all over the world is just a calling. This year's Convention, which came up last week-end, pulled in millions as is now usual, in what is reckoned as the largest religious congregation venue in the world. It might have to be enlarged still. A municipal community is growing around it. More and more people are being drawn to it. My neighbour has grown even more enthusiastic about it. I saw him about two days ago, and he said, \"Look, you mustn't miss that Convention next year!\"\u009d \"No way,\"\u009d I replied. With virtually the population of a mega-city milling around, what does he know! The Information Bill will not be popular with the legislatures of our country, at any level, very soon. In fact, any government might never adopt it. It touches too closely on several issues that may be characterised as \"sensitive.\"\u009d You will agree with me that nothing can be more sensitive to anyone than his or her personal emoluments. Our legislators are not an exception. Several other cadres of the public service, including university lecturers, civil servants and policemen, may not mind sharing the secrets of their earnings with members of the public. In fact, they are sometimes eager to make everyone aware of how little they are taking home at the end of each l-o-n-g month. On the other hand, the earnings of our honourable members are shrouded in mystery, presumably for the reason that what they take home is not so little. Although some aspects have been published overtime, the suspicion is that quite a chunk had been left out. This has been mentioned before in the media, but we regret that the press sometimes assumes some attributes of a faucet by being liable to be turned on and off. It was an issue that needed to have been allowed to run a satisfactory course. But where is the Information Bill once projected on to the centre stage of discussion in the public domain? The earnings of our legislators have given rise to misgivings about the wisdom of the creation of the Revenue Mobilisation and Fiscal Commission. It is the independent body (independent like INEC) that determines what the legislators earn. It also determines what its own head earns. No one may question its decisions or the criteria on which they are based, if any. The secret of what our legislators are paid lies within its vaults and the pockets of the payees. We really don't know how much it is, but not much complaint has been heard from them. However, in a very responsible manner, the commission recently announced that the emoluments of our honourable members might be slashed, in response to the global economic meltdown. Welcome as that may be, a group of legislators is still of the opinion that the Nigerian public, whose money it really is anyway, should be favoured with the exact amount of what is to be slashed. What is more, the group is willing to take drastic action to actualise their desire. The members are even contemplating litigation over the issue. Well, where were they when we were shouting about the Information Law? They would not need to strain themselves if the instrument of extracting such information were in place. But then we live in a nation of headlines. Now that they seem to have made their own point in print, let the rest continue to blow gaily in the wind. Nothing will come out of it. Nothing ever does. One thing that the wind will never be able to blow away, however, is the problem of our universities. The Federal Government is reported as declaring that it has come to the end of its tether, and will no longer engage in any dialogue with the lecturers and their union known, for short, as ASUU. That is a slap on the face of peaceful engagement between dissenting parties as observed and recommended in a decent society. We insist that the government cannot simply walk away. It has a responsibility no less weighty than that of ASUU to resolve the dispute, one way or another. Sometimes, we need to pinch ourselves to snap back into the reality of our indeed being in a democratic dispensation. Can this be a government for the people, even it could claim to be of the people? Even then, we would still have to ask, which people? The parents who cannot afford to send their children abroad, or to private universities? The teachers who are going through so much pain to provide the country with qualitative tertiary education? Indeed, if the mess is allowed to end like this, the government must be for the people who have become so supine that would not know the difference between decent governance and government by an army of occupation. In which case very well is it said that a nation deserves the government it gets. The teachers will have to go back to the lecture rooms. The last time this kind of thing happened, my son's graduation was delayed by two years. It took him some four years, actually, to fully recover due to lost opportunities. There must have been many other young people who went through that same experience as that time. Some probably had their education ruined by that prolonged trade dispute. We are once more walking down that pathway. And we may have to do it all over again, for nothing is settled until it is settled aright. Chief Jonathan B. Ogufere is one of those gracious people who allow me to call them my friend. He has done that for decades. We became friends through our love for sports \"\u201c football, in particular. He is a giant in football administration. This was the man who founded the Vasco da Gama Football Club of Enugu fame, the only team to have bearded the Rangers lion in its den. Those were the days in the 'seventies, when Vasco used to terrorise Rangers by this insuppressible rivalry, right in their own backyard. \"J.B\"\u009d had formed the club much with the same intention as Jerry Enyeazu had brought Rangers to life \"\u201c as an object of revival to a land devastated by war. Ogufere was posted to the East circuit of the P&T to revive the telecommunications system there, which had been virtually destroyed during the hostilities of the civil war. In doing that, he also recalled many a human spirit to life along the way through the exploits of the P&T Vasco da Gama Club. He later emerged onto the national stage, occupying several positions in football, like the Vice-Chairmanship of the Nigeria Football Association, and the Chairmanship of the West African Football Union. Yet he remains a modest sideline commentator, always humble despite his attainments in sports. In fact, it's well-nigh impossible to write about \"J.B\"\u009d without writing about sports \"\u201c which he insists I should continue to do. So, I better stop here. Time out. Related",

        "title": "A man more sinned against than sinning!",
        "author": "Chimdi Maduagwu",
        "text": "By Chimdi Maduagwu William Shakespeare popularized the legend of King Lear in a play of the same title. This play has a unique universal lesson on the concept of sin. Sin, in general terms, operates in the domain of religion. In Islam, it is Haram. It is some form of violation (of rules), wrongdoing, transgression or offence. It is also something forbidden (as in the Islamic concept of Haram). Sin confronts everybody every day; not that we sin, but we are constantly threatened by it. The good book says we were conceived in sin. It is thus, ingrained in us. The context in which Shakespeare used it was similar to this Christian Biblical view: \u201call have sinned\u2026\u201d We know that in one way or another, human beings violate the status quo, that is if they are not already a violation, some form of polution. Some do so intentionally and others do so inadvertently. Whichever way, sin remains sin. Buhari and Jonathan Shakespeare\u2019s King Lear abdicated the throne and released power and wealth to his daughters who pretended to be loyal to him, only to realize that two out of the three daughters had pretended with \u201c glib and oily art\u201d speaking what they purposed not to do. When they started dishing out doses of punishment to him, then the phrase, \u201ca man more sinned against than sinning\u201d became a popular statement in human philosophy. In the current political campaigns, we have seen a lot of sins. The aspirants to the most coveted position in the country have been branded sinners. The two major players, President Goodluck Jonathan and General Mohammadu Buhari are human. They, like all humans have sinned. They have also been sinned against. They have sinned against the nation and the nation has also sinned against them. What I cannot go into details of now is the nature \u2013 either quality or quantity \u2013 of sins they have committed. By the way what do I care about \u201cperils past;\u201d when I am looking forward to newness. I am particularly interested in the last sin, the postponement of the 2015 general elections. For some people, this is a sin against the nation. But one issue that has remained unclear is the sinner. I have heard and read many people who have maintained that it is a sin by the president against the country. Others infer that it is a sin by the ruling party against Nigerians and yet another set of people boldly intone that it is a heinous sin committed by Independent National Electoral Commission, INEC, against the government and people of Nigeria. The opposition has merged the three probable \u201cculprits\u201d and placed them under one umbrella, Jonathan. They maintain that the shift in the election timetable is all about Jonathan. Many reasons have been adduced for this, ranging from the allegations that Jonathanists want to destabilize APC (do not ask me how because I do not know) to the speculation that plots about rigging have not yet been perfected. I want to believe that the opposition is also a major partaker of the sin. Before now, I was really uncomforted, indeed, angry with any suggestions about alteration of election timetable. After all, I argue, INEC published the time line one year ahead of the chosen election days, so what kind of preparation is it that could not be perfected within the period. I also thought that INEC, as an existing institution, must have structures already in place, and need only to juggle few issues to arrive at a workable programme for the elections. But I was mistaken and this, I humbly accept. Little did it occur to me that there are contingencies, or what all of us who reason refer to as unforeseen circumstances and that there are other important contributors to the successful conduct of elections like the security organizations. Contingencies bring to question two strong, sometimes complimentary and sometime opposing, issues: TIMELINESS and ACCURACY. It is good when we keep to time, but it is awesome if we are accurate. The exponents of timeliness are particular about ego constancy and image making and so do not care about whatever comes in between time schedules; but the proposers of accuracy who I suppose are more down to earth and also more forward looking are more interested in stability and strong legacy so are necessarily bothered about contingencies. There are few things we need to look at here. What is the sin in this and who sinned? Accusing fingers point to Mr. President and I ask, how has he done this? True his government suggested the managers of INEC; true also his government saw the entire situation with the advantage of experience (in democratic processes) and suggested a shift so that few details could be tidied up and now we know these details. True also, his government funds INEC. Then the next truth, which is like the grand truth, is that his government guarantees security. Looking at these, one would begin to get a grasp of the sins. Let us proceed slowly on these issues. Prof Atahiru Jega was appointed INEC chairman with a loud ovation; in fact, the appointment was received with wild enthusiasm. INEC has performed reasonably well in the past elections it conducted, but nobody has asked if INEC has a security outfit that kept law and order during those elections. The truth is that Federal Government provided security and maintained law and order. We hear that there are security reports which are not favourable to the conduct of the elections at the times originally fixed and the providers of security, those who maintain law and order, have stated in categorical terms that they will not guarantee optimal protection of lives and property. When asked the financial implications of the rescheduling of the elections, Prof. Jega made it clear that his commission is well funded and would not require adjustments in the existing budget. Other matters arising include the much orchestrated distribution of permanent voters\u2019 cards (PVC). I am one of the numerous Nigerians who have not yet collected the PVC. I understand that card readers have arrived and each card must be subjected to computer recognition processes before the card holder is finally certified an eligible voter. There is need to train the staff that would perform this and other responsibilities during the elections. Forgive me; I cannot give further information on the voting processes because I am clueless but I have an idea that INEC has not yet trained the people to handle this. But before I move on to other issues, let me also say that I am aware of some suits waiting in the court of law that need to be vacated before elections so that judgments in those cases will not take the hands of the clock of our democracy backward. With these, I wonder how it was going to be possible for a credible election to be held of February 14. These are all sins, committed by, and against people. My point is that some have sinned more and some have been sinned against more. I want my readers to make their conclusion on who have been sinned against more: the gentleman, who means well for his country and who has insisted on what is right, though willfully misunderstood, or the bunch of humans who seem to be interested in grabbing an opportunity to atone for sins long committed without actually being sure that more sins may be committed.

        "author": "Ogaga Ifowodo",
        "text": "By Ogaga Ifowodo YOU wish to Allah the Merciful that what you heard about the request for an additional N9 billion for the construction of a brand new mansion for the Vice President is not true, that you had just woken up from a nightmare when you heard lying voices in the dark seeking to \u201cheat up\u201d your head and \u201cthe polity\u201d (apologies to President Jonathan\u2019s spokesmen). Alas, it is true. When N7.5 billion was originally approved, in 2009, for the construction of the same house, you had dismissed, with a holy oath, the father of lies who had been whispering such damnable falsehood in your ear. You were as incredulous as Adeyemi Smart, a senator, would be three years later when Adamu Ismail, executive secretary of the Federal Capital Development Authority defended the act of naked plunder before the FCT senate committee, and you screamed at the fleeing Satan: \u201cIs this house to be built on earth or in heaven? Will the sand, cement, iron rods, tiles, doors and every other material needed for it be made of gold? Will the builders and labourers be paid in gold weights? Tuffia! Get thee behind me, Satan,\u201d you railed and went about your business. Yet, it was true then as it is now. Ismail did not once mention \u201cgold\u201d as he explained the scope of Project VP\u2019s Mansion. The additional N9 billion, a 120 percent increase to the original approved sum, is needed to \u201cbuild a banquet hall, protocol guest house, two other guest houses and civil infrastructure, as well as to purchase furniture and install security gadgets.\u201d Apparently, there had been an unforgivable, even criminal, neglect in the original plan and design of the mansion. But it goes without saying that without these additional amenities, the resultant edifice would be unfit for purpose and an insult to the office and person of the vice president. Which is why Ismail was quick to inform the senate that the \u201cadditional scope to be done on the project\u201d (sic) was \u201cbecause of the personality of Mr. Vice President.\u201d VICE-PRESIDENT Namadi Sambo Got it? A mansion befitting of the Vice President\u2019s personality. Got the bit about civil infrastructure too? According to Ismail, the Bureau of Public Procurement \u201capproved over N6 billion\u201d after vetting the request but that \u201cwould not be enough,\u201d given that \u201cthere are some other adjustments needed to be done,\u201d the details of which he would disclose at a later date and time. But why trouble him to justify what every fool knows? Take only one befitting amenity, the banquet hall, which is to gulp N2.2 billion. As General Obasanjo, who should know, told us, high public service is an invitation to \u201ccome and chop.\u201d Where is the best place to chop? A banquet hall, of course! And what should the tables, chairs, chinaware, cutlery and the very walls of the hall itself be made of if the chopping is to be worth its salt (pun intended)? Why, gold! As for the food, let\u2019s just say that it is not what every Mukoro, Musa or Moriamo, with no personality, eats in a Mama-Put or buka far from banquet halls. There was one almost plausible justification for Project VP\u2019s Mansion. Since 1999 when the great new epoch of democracy dawned on us, the vice president has been, to our shame, homeless. Former Vice President Atiku Abubakar squatted in the official residence of the Chief Justice throughout his tenure. Jonathan endured the added indignity of being relocated to Akinola Aguda House, the Presidential guest house, before blind luck elevated him to Aso Rock. This unflattering image of a wandering, homeless vice president of the oil-crazed Giant of Africa is what the government seeks to erase quickly before we become the laughing-stock of the world. Thankfully, we have petro-dollars to burn. What was it former military dictator General Yakubu Gowon is reputed to have said at the beginning of our oil-induced madness \u2014 that money is not our problem but how to spend it? We have long solved that problem, with the cement armada that followed that utterance, appropriately enough, as a proof. So, let us build a N16 billion mansion to match the personality of our vice president. And let us remember to furnish it with furniture \u201cbought from heaven,\u201d as the bewildered Senator Adeyemi wondered aloud. Only that after this, we must never again hear of government officials going to Germany, anywhere outside the borders of this rich country, for medical treatment. The president and all political office holders must be prohibited from sending their children to school abroad while they remain in office. A country that can lavish so many billions on its vice president\u2019s house is clearly not a beggar nation. Therefore, Jonathan must not attempt the inhuman act of levying another expropriation tax on citizens reeling from the monstrous blows of endemic joblessness and poverty by way of a further withdrawal of the bogus, so-called subsidy on refined oil products. For just think what N16 billion could do to transform one of our teaching hospitals, making it unnecessary for Mrs. Jonathan to enrich Germany with the loads of hard currency she frittered away during her recent \u201cvacation?\u201d Or what that sum could do to rehabilitate primary schools across the country even if at a mere N500 million per state? Just think! Related",

        "text": "EXACTLY twenty four years ago, the Babangida regime held Presidential elections which were supposed to transit the country from military rule to democratic governance. But the regime wanted to hold on to power, it therefore annulled the elections. Some opportunistic politicians supported the annulment while others sought dialogue and subtle ways to re-validate the elections. We in the Pro-Democracy Movement who had always suspected that the regime had a hidden agenda, challenged the dictatorship in the streets and lost over 200 activists to the bullets of the cowardly generals. Despite this, Nigerians persisted and the regime was forced out of power on August 27, 1993. But rather than hand over power to Chief Moshood Kashimawo Abiola, winner of the elections, it put in place, a contraption called the Interim National Government, ING, and backed it with the arsenal of the Armed Forces. So we resumed our street protests and battles; taking on a desperate regime that would not hesitate to use brute force. One of our first strategies was to write a letter to the usurpers demanding that they handed over power. We then organised street marches across the country to the 36 State Government Houses to submit copies of the letter through the governors, to the ING. Expectedly, the regime banned the marches and vowed to stop them by any means necessary. In Lagos, the pro-democracy capital of the country, the march started after a rally at the Ikeja Roundabout with heavily armed riot police presence in the adjourning streets. After about fifteen minutes, we encountered a security cordon just after the Awolowo Way/ Balogun Street junction. As I stood with a lawyer, Onyeisi Chiemeke, discussing what may be the possible move of the police, they seemed to have hemmed us in, and attacked with such violence and viciousness that within minutes we were put in flight. Chiemeke and I ran into Balogun Street with two police vans in hot pursuit. Just then residents of a house opened their gates for us to run in and shut it before the policemen could disembark. They did not border about us as there were many protesters being chased through the streets. Peeping from our sanctuary, we could see several youths beaten by the police being hauled into police vans. After the police had left, we grouped; we still had a large crowd, so we continued the march. When we got to the Awolowo Way/Allen Roundabout, we camped, as our scouts told us that down the road, there were heavily armed police and security men backed by at least three anti-riot armoured personnel carriers. Suddenly, the attack came, this time from four directions; again it was brutal and we were virtually drowned in teargas smoke. We were dispersed. Again, we reconvened. We still had large crowds and only a few were injured. But our leader, Dr. Beko Ransome\u2013Kuti laid on the street, unconscious. He had been leader of the Nigeria Medical Association, NMA, and the body had sent doctors to join the march. A number of them battled for quite some time before he was resuscitated. I made arrangements for him to be taken home while we continued the march, but he refused to leave. I got an activist to take me in his Volkswagen Bettle car on a reconnaissance. The road further at the junction of Radio Lagos had been blocked by the police; it was like a fortress. I turned into Oregun, an area I once lived, and through the back roads, got to the Governor\u2019s Office in Alausa. I noted large contingents of armed police at various points. I realised that it will be virtually impossible for the protesters to get past them to reach their objective; the Governor\u2019s Office. But I also noticed that a side gate to the State Secretariat where the Governor\u2019s Office is located, was opened and unmanned. I returned to inform the protest leadership that a few of us could slip into the Governor\u2019s Office while the police busied itself with the protest. Announcing that we were taking Dr. Kuti to the hospital, he, Tokunboh Afikuyomi (Later a two-term Senator) and I, got into the car, took the route I had earlier taken, and alighted at the unmanned side gate. Immediately we walked in, workers at the Secretariat sighted us and erupted in cheers and solidarity salute. We got into the Governor\u2019s Office where we were told that Governor Michael Otedola was holding a cabinet meeting. Shortly after, the protocol returned to inform us that the governor will see us. We were ushered into the waiting room. A few minutes later, the leader of the riot police, Mr. S, a sadistic police officer whom we had encountered in past protests, busted into the Governor\u2019s waiting room. He grabbed Dr. Kuti, hoisted him up by the trousers and started dragging him towards the entrance. We challenged him and he said the doctor was wanted by the State Commissioner of Police (A burley officer who was later charged but discharged and acquitted for the assassination of Mrs. Kudirat Abiola, an opposition leader and wife of Chief Abiola) I told the officer that Dr. Kuti was an icon in the country and that when he graduated as a medical doctor from Manchester University in 1963, his boss, the Police Commissioner was still battling to pass the First School Leaving Certificate, so doctor should be politely invited and not dragged like a criminal. The police officer persisted, so Afikuyomi and I, prised Dr. Kuti from his hands, hoisted him by his belt from both sides with his legs flaying and pistol dangling, carried him to the entrance of the Governor\u2019s Office and threw him like thrash at his men. He got up and vowed that we would not leave the Office alive. I told him that we know his family in Abeokuta, and that if he tried anything funny, we would go after him and his family. Later we were ushered to Governor Otedola\u2019s presence. He welcomed us and apologised for the scene created by the police in his office. The press was at hand as Dr. Kuti made a formal presentation of our protest letter. The Governor thanked us, promised to deliver the letter, expressed concern about the state of the Nation and called for a peaceful resolution of the political crisis. After the ceremony, we left the Governor\u2019s Office to confront the police officer who had threatened to send us to hell. Related",

        "text": "By Bisi Lawrence Pa Lot, a venerable pastor, parliamentarian and politician of the First Republic, spoke about the menace of the Fulani herdsmen in jocular terms, when I met him some decades ago in Jos. He was well into his 80s himself. He narrated how the herdsmen would arrive unannounced at a particular time of the year and would graze their cattle peacefully for a period of time, Then they would depart for greener pastures without any notice with only a part of the herd, leaving an appreciable number with only a few herdsmen in charge. File: Police They would return later and head for their home base without any rancour as they parted with their erstwhile hosts. There was seldom any argument because the herds were usually limited to agreed areas for grazing, and the entire transaction was conducted on friendly terms. But then came a time when it all turned sour. When the herdsmen left, some of the animals would break loose and destroy valuable crops. After some serious warnings were unheeded, the Tivs, who were the offended hosts, resorted to a severe measure of self-help. They took to slaughtering the errant animals and disposing of them gainfully. The herdsmen, of course, were very angry when they returned and found their flocks depleted. They would demand an explanation from their hosts. The Tivs blandly replied, \u201c Munci\u201d, which means, \u201cWe\u2019ve eaten them\u201d. That did not go down well with the herdsmen and they sometimes attempted to create an incident about it, but the Tivs had a reputation built on bitter experience as devastating archers, totally unafraid and able to defend themselves. They in fact, mocked their former friends and slapped the derisive reply of \u201cMunci \u201c as a nickname, on them. The animosity has not been healed, it would appear, by the passage of time. Rather, the herdsmen have spread their offensive operations to almost all parts of the country. They then began to habitually conduct themselves with little regard for the territories they trampled under the hoofs of their cows. People who formerly ignored them as they passed through the land, began to resent their high-handedness and the damage they caused through their passage. Pa Lot, as matter of fact, hinted me as to why. One makes the mistake of evaluating them by their ragged appearance, but they have always had powerful people behind them\u2014people of means, prominent and influential figures in the society: businessmen, politicians, professionals and even top brass hats. It is even no secret that President Muhammadu Buhari is himself a cattle baron, having declared that much in the Code of Conduct exercise. He had earlier shown his close connection with the business when he rose on behalf of the Northern cattlemen in their confrontation with late Lam Adesina, who was then the Oyo State Governor. Of course, it is on record that Lam would not be intimidated. It is with the confidence of the assured backing of their formidable patrons that the herdsmen presume that they can intimidate any neighbourhood in which they plant themselves. They obtain their sophisticated weaponry from these sources. It is from the position of power and influence that one of the sponsors was recently reported to have stated that nobody could stop him from grazing his cattle anywhere in this country. Such arrogance. And, of course, no one remonstrated with him as if he was speaking about his hereditary back yard. The wealth of the cattle trade is a hidden one, but when you consider that a cow now costs about a hundred thousand naira\u2014before the official hike in the cost of one litre of petrol\u2014millions of naira are on the hoof around the countryside, and the owners know it. And they are the people involved, not the hapless Fulani who just heed their masters\u2019 bidding. It is not those herdsmen who procured AK-47\u2019s for themselves in order to graze some cattle. It is the wealthy owners. They are the ones to be tackled if we wish to put a stop to this dangerous situation. The honourable Minister of Agriculture, and some funny like-minded friends of his, have been proposing ranches to be acquired by government on areas away from the normal native soil of the cattle merchants. I can vouch for the last man in the Southern states that no one will accept such a proposition. \u201cOne Nigeria\u201d, and all that, has its limits. Apart from its physical unrealities, the amount of clashes that are bound to occur is limitless. The \u201cranchers\u201d are bound to occupy\u2014and the word is indeed \u201coccupy\u201d\u2014 the allotted areas with their customary arrogance. And the indigenes won\u2019t stand for it especially now that the herdsmen have shown themselves to be capable of wanton mass murder. The response of those responsible for the security of the nation as a whole, mostly the police, has either been lukewarm or off target. For instance, the Minister of State for Agriculture and Rural Development, Heineken Lokpobiri, said the problem faced by herdsmen was also faced in Cote d\u2019Ivoire, stressing that it was not limited to Nigeria. I have news for the minister if he does not know that it had for decades been a problem in the United States of America before it was resolved. That is the kind of comparison one may entertain for it may elicit how the problem was solved. But he also asserted that the herdsmen arrested were definitely not \u201cconventional Nigerian\u201d Fulani. I have more news for him, whatever he means by that classification: one does not have to be Nigerian to be Fulani, and a non-Fulani herdsman would be hard to find. What would he then be\u2014 a Tuareg? Of course, they are criminals and terrorists who may be using the herdsmen for cover to achieve their despicable ends. In any case, their nationality matters little. Their nefarious activities are of grave danger to the existence of this country as a nation. They are, security wise, at par with Boko Haram. But even worse, they are covering a wider territory within the country, and the response will be country-wide. Hence the recall of the Bakassi Boys, the re-organization of the OPC, and the wake-up call to other sub-ethnic groups. The eventual solution may be along the lines of the creation of cattle routes and resting points for the convenience of all concerned, as the North and South are locked in a symbiotic relationship of seller and buyer that must be sustained along the pace of our national development. This is expatiated upon in a 24-page proposal presented by the Miyetti Allah Cattle Breeders Association of Nigeria, MCBAN recently to concerned authorities. It has all the ingredients of a practicable plan. However, the issue of murderous gangs who break into communities and kill and pillage, is clearly an urgent matter for the police. Time out.
